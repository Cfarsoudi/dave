1    INT. SCHOOL. DAY                                              1    

     JANUARY 1962. MONTAGE                                              

     A nice girls' school in a south west London suburb. We see         
     girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962:        
     walking with books on their heads, practising their                
     handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with          
     each other.                                                        

1A   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          1A    

     In one of the classrooms, MISS STUBBS, an attractive,              
     bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group
     of sixteen-year-old girls. Some of these girls seem to be
     daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their
     fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who           
     looks five years younger than everyone else in the class,
     write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY,
     beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit
     in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's
     smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these
     lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her        
     hand - the only one in the class to do so.                         

                         MISS STUBBS                                    
                   (mock-sighing)                                       
               Jenny. Again.                                            

                         JENNY                                          
               Isn't it because Mr Rochester's                          
               blind?                                                   


2    INT. BEDROOM. DAY                                             2    

     Jenny's bedroom. Books about ponies, a much loved teddy
     bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the
     wall.

     Jenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin
     primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side
     of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us.

     She kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on
     the floor near a cheap record player - they're all
     classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco
     record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins,
     she sings along.

     Immediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath
     her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.

                         MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               I don't want to hear any French
               singing. French singing wasn't on
               the syllabus, last time I looked.

                                                          2.



    Jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. She turns
    the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her
    head right next to the Dansette to hear it.

    Close on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with
    the almost inaudible track.


3   INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY                                         3

    Jenny, her mother and father are finishing Sunday lunch.
    Jenny's father JACK is in his forties, MARJORIE, her mother        
    is slightly younger than Jack, but every bit as middle-
    aged. The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the
    colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're
    listening to Mantovani on the radio. Jenny gets up from the
    lunch table.

                        JENNY
              I've got an English essay to do
              by tomorrow morning.

                        JACK
              I don't want to hear anything
              through the ceiling this
              afternoon, apart from the sound
              of sweat dripping onto textbooks.

                          JENNY
              Cello?

                          JACK
              No cello.

                        JENNY
              I thought we agreed that cello
              was my interest or hobby?

                        JACK
              It's already your interest or
              hobby. When they ask you "What's
              your interest or hobby?" at your
              Oxford interview, you can say,
              "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie.
              You don't need to practise a
              hobby. A hobby is a hobby.

                        JENNY
              Or interest.

                        JACK
                  (ignoring her)
              You don't need to be good at it.
              You just have to be interested in
              it.

                                                          3.



                        JENNY
              Can I stop going to the youth
              orchestra, then?

                        JACK
              No. The orchestra shows you're a
              joiner-inner. Universities like
              joiner-inners.

                        JENNY
              Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined
              in. So now I can stop.

                        JACK
              Well, if you stop, that shows the
              opposite, doesn't it? That shows
              you're a rebel. They don't want
              that at Oxford.

                        JENNY
              No. They don't want people who
              think for themselves.

                        JACK
                  (missing the sarcasm, as
                   is his wont)
              Course they don't.


4   INT. SCHOOL HALL. DAY                                         4    

    Jenny with cello sits in the string section. Everyone is
    getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving.
    Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice-
    looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two
    13 year old boys sitting between them wave too,
    parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's
    embarrassment and Jenny's fury.

    The silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly
    one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of
    them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the
    frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart
    tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are
    scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.


5   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                              5    

    Jenny and Graham are talking while he struggles to take his
    bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the
    violin strapped to his back. Graham is nervous,
    chronically unconfident and shy.

                        GRAHAM
              Should I wear, you know, Sunday
              best?

                                                            4.



                        JENNY
              You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to
              show my father you're un jeune
              homme serieux, not a teddy boy.

                         GRAHAM
              Oh, God.

                        JENNY
              It'll be all right. I won't wait.                        
              It's going to bucket down in a                           
              minute. I'll see you at the                              
              weekend.                                                 

    Jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street.

                        GRAHAM
              Oh, yes. Bye.

    The two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses.

                        SMALLER BOY 1
              Goodbye, darling! See you at the                         
              weekend! I will miss you with all                        
              of my heart!

    Graham blushes. Jenny swipes the chief offender over the
    head with her sheet music.


6   EXT. BUS STOP. DAY                                            6

    The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A             
    mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and
    a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to
    let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties,
    dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the
    car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus
    stop.

    In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the
    foot of one of the children,further slowing down their
    painfully slow progress across the road.

    Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles
    ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates
    for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.

                         DAVID
              Hello.

    Jenny ignores him.

                        DAVID
              Listen. If you've got any sense,
              you wouldn't take a lift from a
              strange man.

                                                          5.



    Jenny smiles thinly.

                        DAVID
              I am, however, a music lover, and
              I'm worried about your cello. So                         
              what I propose is, you put it in                         
              the car and walk alongside me.

                        JENNY
              How do I know you won't just
              drive off with the cello?

                        DAVID
              Ah. Good point.

    He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that
    have stopped behind him.

                        DAVID
              How much does a new cello cost?
              Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't
              know. Let's say thirty.

    He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes,
    hands them to her.

                        DAVID
              There. Security.

    Jenny laughs and waves the money away.                             


7   EXT. STREET. NEAR SCHOOL. DAY.                                7    

    Later. The cello is in the back seat of the Bristol. Jenny
    is trotting alongside the car, while David leans
    nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while
    driving.

                        DAVID
              I'm David, by the way.

    She says nothing.

                        DAVID
              And you are...?

                        JENNY
              Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a
              car like this before. C'est tres
              chic.

                        DAVID
              It's a Bristol. Not many of `em
              made.

    Jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.

                                                          6.



                        DAVID
              How did the concert go?

                        JENNY
              It was a rehearsal. The concert's
              next Thursday.

                        DAVID
              What are you playing?

                        JENNY
                  (making a face)
              Elgar.

                        DAVID
              Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a
              shame he spent so much time in
              Worcester, don't you? Worcester's
              too near Birmingham. And you can
              hear that in the music. There's a
              horrible Brummy accent in there,
              if you listen hard enough.

    Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to
    be able to make Elgar jokes.

                        DAVID
              Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and                         
              Jews mix very well.                                    

                        JENNY
              I'm not a Jew!

                         DAVID
                   (smiling)
              No. I am. I wasn't...accusing
              you.

                        JENNY
              Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I
              sit in the car with my cello?

    David stops the car.

                           DAVID
              Jump in.


8   INT. CAR. DAY                                               8

    Jenny shuts the door and sinks approvingly into the white
    leather seat. David regards the dripping girl with
    amusement.

                        JENNY
              It's even nicer on the inside.

                                                           7.



                         DAVID
               Where to, madam?

     Jenny makes a face.

                         JENNY
               I only live round the corner.

                         DAVID
               What a shame. We'll just make it
               last as long as we can.


9    EXT. STREET. NEAR JENNY'S. DAY                               9     

     The Bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace.


10   INT/EXT. CAR JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                              10    

     David reaches across Jenny while driving slowly, opens the         
     glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.

                           DAVID
               Smoke?

                         JENNY
               I'd better not. I'm a bit close
               to home.

     David lights one for himself.

                         DAVID
               I suppose cellists must go to a
               lot of concerts.

                         JENNY
               We don't go to any concerts. We                          
               don't believe in them.

                         DAVID
               Oh, they're real.

                         JENNY
               So people say.

                         DAVID
               Why don't we believe in them?

                         JENNY
               I suppose...What would he say?

                         DAVID
               Your father, this is?

                                                           8.



                         JENNY
                   (Darkly)
               Oh, yes. He'd say there's no
               point to them. They're just for
               fun. Apart from school concerts,
               of course, which are no fun at
               all, so we go to those. The
               proper ones don't help you get                         
               on.

                         DAVID
               Which of course is what is so                          
               wonderful about them. Anyway,
               you'll go one day.

                         JENNY
                   (heartfelt)
               Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it
               seems as though that's what all
               this slog is for. If I get to
               University, I'm going to read
               what I want and think about what
               I want and listen to what I want.
               And I'm going to look at
               paintings and go to French films
               and talk to people who know lots
               about lots.

                         DAVID
               Good for you. Which University?

                         JENNY
               Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go
               anywhere?

                         DAVID
               I studied at what I believe they
               call the University of Life. And
               I didn't get a very good degree
               there.

     Jenny smiles.

                         JENNY
               This is me. Thank you.

     She gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after
     her for a moment, then drives off.


11   INT. JENNY'S SITTING-ROOM. AFTERNOON                       11

     Jenny, her parents and Graham are eating afternoon tea -
     neat fish-paste sandwiches, Battenberg cake, best china.

                         MARJORIE
               How's your mother, Graham?

                                                      9.



                    GRAHAM
          She's fine, thanks. She sends her
          best, by the way.

                    JACK
          Where are you applying, Graham?

Jenny looks embarrassed. She knows what's coming.

                    GRAHAM
          I'm not sure yet.

                    JACK
          Well, when will you be sure? You
          can't let the grass grow under
          your feet, you know. Otherwise
          you'll be at the back of the
          queue.

                    JENNY
              (deadpan)
          I suppose so. I suppose the
          growing grass would knock you off
          balance, and then you'd fall
          over, and by the time you picked
          yourself up, there'd be a queue.

Her father shoots her a look - is she being cheeky?

                    GRAHAM
          I might take a year off.

Jenny winces. Jack looks at him as if he's just said he'll
take all his clothes off.

                      JACK
          What for?

                    GRAHAM
              (mumbling)
          I don't know. Maybe do some
          travelling, that sort of thing.

                    JACK
          Travelling? What are you, a teddy
          boy?

Close-up of Jenny - she knows what's coming, and can't bear
it. Beat.

                    JACK
              (nodding at Jenny)
          You know she's going to Oxford,
          don't you? Oxford. English. If we
          can get her Latin up to scratch.

Jenny sighs.

                                                           10.



                          JACK
                So she's studying English at
                Oxford while you're a wandering
                Jew...

      Jenny looks at him curiously. Graham steels himself to
      speak.

                          GRAHAM
                Mr Mellor...I'm not a teddy boy.
                I'm an homme serieux. Jeune. An
                homme jeune serieux homme.

      Jenny winces again. Her father stares at Graham. Graham
      blushes.


12    INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                 12     

      It's the night of the youth orchestra concert. Jenny, her
      mother and father are on their way out of the door. Jack is
      carrying the cello. Jenny is in her school uniform, with
      her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. The three of
      them are flustered. Jenny opens the front door for her
      father and he stumbles outside.

                             JENNY
                Oh!


12A   INT/EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                             12A    

      She has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to
      pick it up - a large bunch of flowers.

                          JENNY
                They're for me!

                          MARJORIE
                    (curious)
                Who are they from?

      Jenny opens the card that's attached to them.

                             JENNY
                Gosh. Him.

                          MARJORIE
                Who's `him'?

                          JENNY
                Just...A chap I met.

                          MARJORIE
                A chap who sends flowers? So he's
                a man-chap?

                                                     11.



                    JENNY
          Yes, he is, really.

Jack stares at the flowers in disbelief. The bunch of          
flowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear more
typically associated with a biochemical attack.

                    JACK
          What's going on here?

                    MARJORIE
              (drily, knowing the
               trouble this will
               cause)
          Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been
          sent some flowers by a chap.

                    JACK
          A chap? What kind of chap? Who?
          Why?

                    JENNY
              (patiently)
          He's wishing me luck for tonight.

                    JACK
          Are you sure that's all he's
          wishing? And where does he get
          the money from?

                    JENNY
          He earns it, I expect.

                    JACK
          What do you mean, he earns it?
          Why isn't he at school? What does
          he do?

                    JENNY
          Can we just go? Otherwise the
          bunch of good-luck flowers will
          actually be responsible for me
          actually missing the concert.
          Which would be ironic, n'est ce
          pas?

                    JACK
          Well I don't like it.

                    MARJORIE
          Objection noted. Jenny?

                    JENNY
          Noted.

                                                           12.



                          JACK
                Ten bob's worth of luck, I
                reckon. That's a lot for a
                schoolgirl. You can't leave them
                out here, anyway. I'd burgle a
                house that had flowers outside.
                They'll think we're made of
                money.


12B   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                12B    

      Jenny sighs, puts them inside the house, shuts the door.          


13    INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       13

      Jenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting
      at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping
      cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the
      three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest.
      HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier;
      TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also
      the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a
      scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering
      and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it
      with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking
      pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of
      pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino
      with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her
      disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.

                          JENNY
                The whole point about him is that                       
                he doesn't feel.

                          TINA
                We still don't have to like him.

                          JENNY
                Camus doesn't want you to like
                him. What he's trying to say is
                that feeling is bourgeois. Being
                engagee is bourgeois. His mother
                dies and he doesn't feel
                anything. He kills this Arab and
                he doesn't feel anything.

                          TINA
                I wouldn't feel anything if my
                mother died. Does that make me an
                existentialist?

                          JENNY
                No. That just makes you a cow.

                                                             13.



                              HATTIE
                 Une vache.

     Laughter.


14   EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY                                   14    

     Jenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking.

                           JENNY
                 Well I'm going to be French. I'm
                 going to Paris and I'm going to
                 smoke and listen to Jacques Brel
                 and wear black. And I won't
                 speak. Ever. C'est plus chic,
                 comme...

     She breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other
     side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the
     shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a
     packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him
     while the others watch.

                              DAVID
                 Hello.

                           JENNY
                 Hello. Thank you.

                           DAVID
                 How did it go?

                           JENNY
                 Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I
                 didn't mess my bit up, anyway.
                 And no-one got thrown out of the
                 orchestra afterwards.

                           DAVID
                 Always the mark of a cultural
                 triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran
                 into you. What are you doing on
                 Friday?

                           JENNY
                 Going to school.

                           DAVID
                 I meant the evening.

                           JENNY
                     (embarrassed)
                 Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.

                                                     14.



                    DAVID
          Because I'm going to listen to                       
          some Schubert in St John's, Smith                    
          Square. My friends Danny and                         
          Helen will be going too, so it
          wouldn't be...I'll tell you what.
          I'll come and pick you up, and if
          your mother and father
          disapprove, then you can have the
          tickets and go with one of them.
          How does that sound?

Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his
eagerness to please seems to convince her.

                    JENNY
          Thank you. And I'd like you to
          take me. I'd like to go with
          someone who knows when to clap.

                    DAVID
          I usually watch Danny. He knows
          that sort of thing.

Jenny smiles.

                     DAVID
          Seven? And we'll probably go for
          a spot of supper afterwards, if
          you...But if you, if that's
          not...Well, we can always put you
          in a taxi.

                    JENNY
              (flat disbelief)
          Supper.

                    DAVID
          If you want.

                    JENNY
          The trouble is, we'll already
          have eaten.

                    DAVID
          Well. I mean, if you'd like
          supper, then, perhaps on Friday
          you could...not eat?

                    JENNY
              (embarrassed again)
          Oh. Yes. Of course.

Jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of
the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with
their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and
starts to walk on.

                                                     15.



                    TINA
          I'm sorry. I just had the
          strangest dream. I dreamed you
          crossed the road and spoke to a
          handsome man with the most
          beautiful car I've ever seen. And
          then you came back and you didn't
          mention it.

Jenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently.

                    TINA
          `Oo wazzee?

                    JENNY
              (light, playful)
          Just a man who's been trying to
          pick me up. We're going to a
          concert on Friday night. And then
          we're having a spot of supper.

                    TINA
              (shrieking)
          A spot of supper?                                    

                    JENNY
          You've heard of supper?

                    HATTIE
          We've heard of it. But we've
          never eaten it.                                      

                    JENNY
          Neither of you is interested in
          the concert part, I notice.

                    HATTIE
          No. Of course not.

                    TINA
          Oh my God! I've only just
          realised! That's what's going to
          happen to you, isn't it? Look at
          her! Men are going to pick her up
          in the street and take her out to
          supper!

                    HATTIE
          God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't
          thought of that. Look at her.

                    JENNY
          Don't be so daft.

                    TINA
          We're trying to attract the
          attention of boys.

                                                          16.


               And she's fighting off men.
               Anyway. You're going to have to
               tell us more than that.

                         JENNY
               Why?

                         HATTIE
               Because no man's ever   going to
               ask us out to supper.   Not until
               we're ladies, anyway.   You're
               going to have to tell   us
               everything. Otherwise   it's not
               fair.

                         JENNY
               There won't be anything to tell.

                         TINA
               Well, make something up, then.


15   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                  15

     Jenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good,
     but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her
     dress, which looks too old for her. Her father is standing
     in front of her, shouting.

                         JACK
               I won't allow it!

                         JENNY
                   (coolly)
               Fine. He's quite happy for you to
               take me.

                         JACK
                   (uncertainly)
               Right. I will.

                         JENNY
               Good.

                         JACK
               Where is it?

                         JENNY
               St John's Smith Square.                                  

                         JACK
               Where's that?

                         JENNY
               I don't know. I'm sure we could
               find out.

     Marjorie comes into the room.

                                                     17.



                    MARJORIE
          It's in Westminster. Just around                    
          the corner from the Abbey.                          

Jack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the
nearest opium den.

                    JACK
          How d'you know that?

                    MARJORIE
          I had a life before we were
          married, you know.

                    JENNY
          He soon put a stop to that.

                    JACK
          There we are.

                    JENNY
          Where are we?

                    JACK                                      
          Near Westminster Abbey. I'm not                     
          going all the way over there.

                    JENNY
          The trouble is, that's where St                     
          John's Smith Square is.                             

                    JACK
          And I've just said. That's where
          I'm not going. There must be
          something on locally. Where's the
          paper?

                    MARJORIE
          Jack, she wants to see someone
          who can play. She doesn't want to
          see Sheila Kirkland scratching
          away. I'll take her.

                    JACK
          And how are you going to get over                   
          there? RAF helicopter?                              

The doorbell rings.

                    JENNY
          That's him. Now what?

                    JACK
          Oh, bloody hell.

                      MARJORIE
          Jack!

                                                     18.



Jenny starts towards the door, and then turns.

                     JENNY
           Oh, and by the way...David's a
           Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch
           yourself.

She   goes to the door.

                      JACK
               (panic-stricken and
                 shouting)
           What's she talking about? I've
           never said anything like that in
           my life! Anyway, it's just an
           expression! I'm not against the
           Jews!

Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly in
his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket,
slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is
brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most
colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly
exotic.

David has obviously heard Jack's last line.

                     DAVID
               (pleasantly)
           I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David                   
           Goldman.                                            

He offers his hand.

                     JACK
           I didn't mean I'm not against
           you... Actually, I did mean that,
           because I'm not, but...

                      JENNY
           Dad!

David's hand is still extended - in his confusion and
embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now,
and shakes it for way too long.

                     JACK
           I'm sorry. What I'm saying is
           that you're not the sort of, of
           person I'd be against, if I were
           the sort of person who was
           against...people. You're not an
           old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and
           this is Marjorie.

                                                     19.



                    DAVID
              (deadpan)
          You didn't tell me you had a
          sister, Jenny.

General confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjorie
giggles, and then offers her hand.

                    DAVID
          You're a lucky man, Jack.

                    JACK
          I suppose I am, yes.

They all sit down.

                    DAVID
          So. Gosh. (He looks around
          approvingly.) This is lovely.

Marjorie smiles.

                       MARJORIE
          Thank you.

                    JACK
          I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a
          drink?

                    DAVID
          I'd love one, Jack, but we're
          running a little late. If Jenny's
          ready, perhaps we'll shoot off.

Jenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble.

                    JENNY
          Ah. Well. Dad's got something to
          tell you.

                    JACK
          No, no, nothing...It was more of
          a question, really. How would you
          get to St John's Smith Square                        
          from here? For future reference?

                    DAVID
          Oh, it's a pretty straight run,
          really. Up to Hammersmith, take                      
          the A4 through Kensington and                        
          you're there.                                        

                    JACK
          Simple as that.

                    DAVID
          Simple as that.

                                                     20.



Jack smiles broadly.

                     MARJORIE
              (playfully)
          So shall I book some tickets for                     
          something?

                       JACK
                 (still smiling)
          No.

Beat.

                    JACK
          Back by ten, please, David. She's
          usually in bed by then.

Jenny winces.

                    DAVID
          I was hoping Jenny would come
          with me afterwards to have a bite
          of supper with my aunt Helen.

Jenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny and
Helen have become `Aunt Helen'.

                    JACK
          Oh, well, I suppose...

                    DAVID
          How about if I promise to have
          her in by eleven thirty?

                    JACK
          Well, it's Friday night. And if
          you're going out to the West
          End...

                    DAVID
          Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.
          See you again.

They exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie.
Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it
suavely,leaving her a little flustered.

                    MARJORIE
          Have a nice time.

                       JENNY
          Bye.

Jenny and David leave.

                                                           21.



                          JACK
                    (sniffing the air)
                What's that smell? Has he got
                perfume on?

                          MARJORIE
                It's called after-shave, Jack.
                And it makes a change from
                carbolic soap.

                          JACK
                At least there's no confusion, if
                you smell of carbolic soap.

      Marjorie rolls her eyes.

                          MARJORIE
                Nobody's ever going to get
                confused about you, dear.


15A   EXT. ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                        15A    

      Jenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny             
      suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for          
      her - other adults are milling around outside, and the            
      women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an        
      incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late          
      twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen         
      is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get.           
      She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both        
      appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy          
      Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not         
      yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David       
      and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of         
      these two.                                                        

                          DAVID                                         
                Hello hello. Are we late?                               

                          HELEN                                         
                I was hoping we'd miss the                              
                beginning, and then it wouldn't                         
                be worth going in, and we could                         
                go off dancing or something.                            

                          DANNY                                         
                Helen is one of the more                                
                reluctant members of tonight's                          
                audience.                                               

      Jenny and David laugh politely.                                   

                           DAVID                                        
                Jenny, these are my friends Helen                       
                and Danny.                                              

                                                          22.



     Jenny shakes hands with the two of them. They both give her      
     fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard         
     about her.                                                       

                           DAVID (CONT'D)                             
               Shall we?                                              

     They walk into the hall.                                         


16   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                         16    

     It's a beautiful hall - Jenny is dazzled by the                  
     surroundings and the company. She's particularly bowled          
     over by Helen.                                                   

                         HELEN                                        
               Look. We can leave our coats                           
               over there. I want to get rid of                       
               this.

     She nods at the coat she's carrying. Jenny looks thrilled        
     at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with Helen.      
     Danny hands Helen his coat, without saying anything. The         
     girls walk over to another reception table a few yards           
     away, behind which is a cloakroom. A lady is exchanging          
     overcoats for tickets. Almost involuntarily, Jenny touches       
     the sleeve of Helen's velvety jacket. She stops herself.
     Helen notices.

                         JENNY
               I'm so sorry.

                         HELEN
                   (amused)
               That's OK. It's nice, isn't it?

                         JENNY
               It's beautiful. Where did it come
               from?

                         HELEN
               Oh, South Ken somewhere.

     Helen looks at Jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress,
     apparently wanting to return the compliment.

                         HELEN
                   (nodding at the dress)
               This is...Well, it's good for
               this sort of concert, isn't it?

                          JENNY
                   (quietly)
               Thank you.

                                                       23.



Helen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat
over imperiously.

                    HELEN
          We should go shopping together
          one day, if you want.

She takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady.                    

                    JENNY
          That would be nice. But South
          Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher
          pour moi.

They stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny
embarrassed.

                    HELEN
          Sorry?

                    JENNY
          I just said....It was too
          expensive for me.

                    HELEN
          No you didn't. You said something
          completely different.

                    JENNY
          I just...Well, I said it in
          French.

                    HELEN
          In French? Why?

Jenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can
see - that Helen is simply very dim.

                    JENNY
          I don't know.

Jenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance bell
rings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny's
surprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they
walk.

                    HELEN
          Anyway. It's too expensive for
          me, too. We don't have to worry
          about that. If you want something
          in South Ken, get David to take
          you shopping.

                    JENNY
          Why on earth would he want to
          take me shopping?

                                                          24.



     Helen makes a knowing face.


17   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                           17    

     David, Jenny, Danny and Helen in a row in the middle of the
     auditorium, watching the stage and listening to the music.
     Jenny can't concentrate - she's too excited by the occasion
     and the company. Jenny sneaks a glance at Helen, who stares
     straight ahead, unblinking and enigmatic. David is smiling,
     as if he's trying to communicate enjoyment; Danny's eyes
     flicker across the stage - he understands the music, its
     component parts, which musicians are contributing what.
     Jenny takes it all in.


18   EXT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                           18    

     Jenny, David, Danny and Helen emerge with the other concert-
     goers.

                         DAVID
               I booked a table at Juliette's.                          
               Will that kill the mood, do you
               think?

                         HELEN
               Oh, I do hope so.                                        

     The others laugh.

                         HELEN
               I always think I'm going to my
               own funeral when I listen to
               classical music. (Tentatively)
               That was classical, wasn't it?

                         DANNY
               Yes. Very classical. As classical
               as you can get.

     Helen looks pleased.

                          DAVID
               Juliette's it is, then. Heaven
               forbid that we should end the
               evening reflecting on our own
               mortality.

     Jenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this.


19   INT. JULIETTE'S. NIGHT                                       19    

     A singer in the Julie London mould is singing `I'm In The          
     Mood For Love' while cigarette girls and glamorous
     waitresses patrol the tables.

                                                     25.


Jenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club,       
eating and talking. She looks about twelve, but she's          
thrilled to be there. We know now that her life can never
be the same again, and there will be no going back to fish-
paste sandwiches with spotty Graham.

                    DAVID                                      
          Have you never heard "Chante
          Francoise Sagan"?

Jenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly
awe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - which
she takes. He lights it for her while she's listening.

                    DANNY
          Oh, it's wonderful.

                    JENNY
          I've only got....Well, I think
          it's just called `Juliette
          Greco'. The one with the eyes on
          the sleeve. I saved up and got my
          French conversation teacher to
          bring it back after Christmas.

                    HELEN
          You've got a French conversation
          teacher?

                    JENNY
          Yes.

                    HELEN
          Is that why you suddenly speak
          French for no reason?

                    DANNY                                      
              (ignoring her)
          You must have seen her sing?                         

Jenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she
have seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. Who    
hasn't seen Juliette Greco?                                    

                    DAVID
          She's marvellous.

                    DANNY
          But you should see her in Paris,
          not here. David will take you.

                    DAVID
          I'd love to. You'd fit right in.

                    HELEN
              (sympathetically)
          Better than here, really.

                                                     26.



                    DAVID
          It's wonderful to find a young
          person who wants to know things.
          There's so much I want you to
          see.

They sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time for
the double-entendre to disappear into the smoke.

                    DAVID
          Are you still all right to come
          and have a look at that Pembroke
          Villas place with me on Friday,
          Danny?

                    DANNY
          Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a
          Burne-Jones coming up at
          Christie's on Friday. And I want                     
          it.                                                  

                    JENNY
              (laughing in disbelief)
          You're thinking of buying a Burne-
          Jones? A real one?

                    DANNY
          I just have a feeling that the
          pre-Raphaelites are going to take
          off.

                    JENNY
          I love the pre-Raphaelites.

                    DAVID
              (excited by her
               education)
          Do you?

                    JENNY
          Yes, of course. Rossetti and
          Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman
          Hunt, so much. He's so garish.

Danny looks at her. There's clearly more to this schoolgirl
than he thought.

                    DAVID
          Absolutely! Why don't we all go
          to the auction? Wouldn't that be
          fun?

                    JENNY
          An auction. Gosh. How exciting.

                                                          27.



                         DANNY
               Next Friday morning. David will
               pick you up.

                         JENNY
                   (crestfallen)
               Oh. Friday.

                         DANNY
               You're busy?

                            JENNY
               Well. Yes.

     She doesn't want to explain why.                                  

                            DANNY                                      
               Tant pis.                                               

     Helen looks at him aghast. Why has he started speaking            
     French?                                                           

                         DAVID
               Are you sure you're busy?

     Jenny hesitates.

                         JENNY
               No. I'm sure I could....re-
               arrange. That would be lovely.


20   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                   20

     Jenny lets herself quietly into the house. The hallway is
     dark, but she can hear noises from the kitchen. She pokes
     her head round the corner, and sees her mother doing the
     washing-up.

                          MARJORIE
               Oh, hello, love. Did you have a
               nice time?

                         JENNY
               What are you doing?

                         MARJORIE
               I can't get this casserole dish
               clean. We had hot-pot tonight,
               and it's all burnt round...

                         JENNY
               It's twenty-five to twelve. We
               finish tea at seven.                                    

                                                             28.



                           MARJORIE
                 I know what the time is. How was
                 your evening?

                           JENNY
                 It was...It was the best night of
                 my life.

                           MARJORIE
                 And he took you home in his car?
                 Right to the door?

     Jenny looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard what
     Jenny has just said.

                           JENNY
                 Goodnight, Mum.

                           MARJORIE
                 And I'm glad you enjoyed the
                 concert.


21   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                             21

     Jenny, Hattie and Tina are    sitting on their desks, waiting
     for the start of a lesson.    Nine or ten classmates are
     scattered around the room,    talking distractedly, but
     Jenny's group is much more    animated: Tina and Hattie are
     leaning forward, listening    to Jenny, their eyes bright.
     They are clearly awestruck    by Jenny's tales of the outside
     world.

                            TINA
                     (to Hattie)
                 I'm not interested in Schubert. I
                 want to know what else was on the
                 programme.

     Laughter.

                           JENNY
                 There was nothing like that. He
                 was the perfect gentleman. He
                 just said he wanted to take me
                 places and show me things.

                           TINA
                 Things plural? Oh my Gawd!

     More laughter. The English teacher, MISS STUBBS, young and
     fresh-faced and lively-looking, enters, and picks up on
     the excitement of Jenny's coterie.

                                                     29.



                    MISS STUBBS
          I knew that in the end `Jane
          Eyre' would work its magic upon
          you. I'm presuming that's what
          you're so animated about.

The students start to sit down at desks in a more
conventional arrangement.

                       JENNY
          Of course.

                     TINA
          `Jane Eyre' and Jenny's new
          boyfriend.

                    JENNY
          He's not my "new boyfriend". God.

                    TINA
          It's true. He's more a man-
          friend, isn't he? He's got a
          sports-car, Miss Stubbs.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Ah. A Mr Rochester figure.

                     TINA
          I think he must be as blind as Mr
          Rochester.

Laughter. Jenny pulls a face at her.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Is there no end to your thirst
          for literary understanding,
          Jenny? As you may have noticed,
          I'm attempting to turn the
          subject away from Jenny's lurid
          love-life and towards the matter
          in hand.

She starts to hand out essays.

                    MISS STUBBS
          And it's quite clear on this
          evidence that most of you know
          much too much about the former,
          and almost nothing about the
          latter. Reluctantly I must
          concede that Jenny is evidently
          an expert on both matters.
          Excellent as always, Jenny.

Miss Stubbs slaps an essay down on Jenny's desk. We can see
that it's marked `A+'.

                                                            30.




22   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT                                  22

     Jenny at her desk, working. She puts down her pen,
     distracted.


23   INT. DAVID'S CAR. DAY                                        23

     David sitting in his Bristol, waiting.


24   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                             24

     We see the Bristol parked outside, and Jenny walking
     towards it, a small figure in a large playground. She's
     clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's
     making last-minute adjustments to her civvies. A teacher
     walks towards her, and Jenny almost freezes - but the
     teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. Jenny
     keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then
     breaks into a run.


25   INT/EXT. CAR/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY                          25    

     Jenny and David are driving along a North Kensington
     street.

                         JENNY
               How do you know Danny?

     David is distracted. He's driving slowly, apparently
     looking for an address.

                         DAVID
               Oh, you know. We kept bumping
               into each other, and we became
               pals, and we've ended up doing a
               bit of work together, when it
               suits us.

                         JENNY
               What kind of work?

                         DAVID
               Property. A bit of art dealing.
               Some buying and selling. This and
               that...

     He stops the car.

                         DAVID
               I'll be two seconds.

     He gets out of the car, and Jenny watches him as he crosses
     the road.

                                                          31.


     Outside a dilapidated house covered in scaffolding stands a
     large West Indian family, mother, father, three or four
     small children and a dog. They are surrounded by what
     appears to be all their worldly goods. David squats down on
     his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the
     smallest. Then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the
     family down the path. He unlocks the door and leads them
     inside.

     In an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering
     down anxiously.


26   EXT. STREET/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY                           26    

     David emerges from the house, jangling his keys.


27   INT. CAR. DAY                                                27

     Jenny opens the glove compartment where David keeps his
     cigarettes, takes out the packet, removes one for herself,
     offers the packet to David as he gets into the car. He
     lights them both.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry about that.

                         JENNY
               How do you know those, those
               ...Negro people?

                         DAVID
               They're clients.

                          JENNY
               Clients?

                         DAVID
               Jenny darling, even schwarzers
               have to live somewhere. And it's
               not as if they can rent off their
               own kind, is it?

     He starts the car and drives off.

                         JENNY
               I'm not sure I quite understand
               what you do.

                         DAVID
               You don't need to. It's too
               boring. All you need to know is
               that I work in property so that I
               can take you to nice places.

     Jenny's POV of the black family in one window, and the
     little old lady disappearing from another.

                                                             32.




28   INT. CHRISTIE'S. DAY                                           28

     Danny intent on a catalogue, Helen gazing dreamily into              
     space, as David and Jenny push their way through the                 
     crowded auction room. The auctioneer burbles on in the
     background.

                         DANNY
               You nearly missed it.

     Jenny is in awe of rich London in all its finery. The
     auctioneer clears his throat.

                         AUCTIONEER
               We turn to lot 41, The Tree of                             
               Forgiveness, by Sir Edward Burne-                          
               Jones. This is a rare opportunity
               to purchase a key work of the Pre-
               Raphaelite movement. Who will
               start me off at five hundred                               
               guineas?                                                   

     Jenny glances at Danny. He makes no move at this price.
     Neither does anyone else. He's poised and listening hard.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Two hundred?

     A middle-aged lady, the epitome of the middle-aged
     contemporary Sloane, twin-set, pearls and a lot of      face
     powder, raises her hand.

                         AUCTIONEER
               Thank you, madam. Three hundred?                           

     A man raises his hand.                                               

                         AUCTIONEER                                       
               Do I hear three-fifty?                                     

     The middle -aged Sloane nods.                                        

                         AUCTIONEER                                       
               Over to you sir. Four hundred                              
               guineas? Thank you. Four hundred                           
               and fifty...                                               

     Danny continues to sit there. Jenny is confused. The middle-         
     aged lady bids four-fifty. David, sitting next to Danny,             
     whispers something to him. Danny nods.

                          DAVID
                   (whispers to Jenny)
               Your turn.

     Jenny looks at him.

                                                     33.



                    AUCTIONEER
          No further bids?

                    DAVID
          Quick!

Jenny raises her hand high, just as she'd do at school.

                    AUCTIONEER
          Five hundred guineas from the                       
          very eager new bidder.                              

People look round and smile when they see who has come in.
Jenny blushes, but stares fixedly ahead.

                     AUCTIONEER                               
          Five hundred and fifty, madam?                      
          Thank you.                                          

Jenny looks at David, who nods.                               

                    AUCTIONEER                                
          Six hundred guineas.                                

Jenny gestures more economically.                             

                    AUCTIONEER                                
          Six-fifty? Thank you, madam.                        
          Seven hundred...                                    

Jenny is almost insouciant this time.                         

                    AUCTIONEER                                
          Seven hundred?                                      

The middle-aged lady shakes her head and purses her lips.     
when asked if she wants to bid £700.                          

                    AUCTIONEER
          Sold for six hundred and fifty                      
          guineas. Thank you.                                 

He brings down the gavel, and a murmur goes around the
room. Jenny is excited and giggly. David pats her on the
back.

                    AUCTIONEER                                
          Your name, please?                                  

Jenny looks at Danny.                                         

                    DANNY                                     
          You know who you are.                               

                    JENNY                                     
              (to Danny)                                      
          Jenny Mellor.                                       

                                                          34.



                         DANNY                                         
               I know who you are, too. Tell                           
               him.                                                    

                         JENNY                                         
                   (louder,to auctioneer)                              
               Jenny Mellor.                                           

                         DANNY                                         
               Thank you. Couldn't have bought                         
               it without you.                                         

                         DAVID
               Well done. A nerveless
               performance.

     Jenny beams. She's thrilled.


29   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      29

     A beautiful, large, airy sitting room in the first-floor
     flat in Bedford Square. The flat is unusually and
     tastefully decorated, opulent and indicative of Bohemian
     good taste. Jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and
     walking around the room enthralled, looking at Danny's
     existing Pre-Raphaelite art collection; he has three or
     four big paintings proudly displayed on his walls. Danny
     is talking her through them while Helen and David, sitting
     on the sofa, watch - David proudly, Helen impassively.

                         DANNY
               A couple of years ago you could
               pick these up for fifty quid, you
               know. Nobody was interested.

                         JENNY
               Really? Fifty pounds? I don't
               believe you.

     Suddenly Jenny sees a cello in the corner of the room - a
     good one.

                         JENNY
               That's not a Lockey-Hill!

                         DANNY
               There aren't many people who come
               in here and say that.

                         HELEN
               Certainly not me.

                         JENNY
               It's beautiful. Do you play?

                                              35.



                    DANNY
          I used to. I vowed to myself that
          one day I'd own one of these. And
          now I own one and never touch it.
          It's vulgar to put it on show,
          really.

                    HELEN
          Give it to Jenny.

                    DANNY
          That would be even more vulgar.

                    DAVID
          Play for us, Jenny.

                    JENNY
          Gosh, no. One day. When I'm good
          enough for it.

                    DAVID
          She's good enough now.

                    JENNY
          Oh, David. You've never heard me.

Danny stands up and stretches.

                    DAVID
          I shall come to hear you in St             
          John's Smith Square. Or in                 
          Oxford, when you get there.

                    DANNY
          We should all go and spend a
          weekend in Oxford. Straw boaters,
          punting, cream teas, antiquarian
          bookshops. Bit of business, if we
          can find it. What about next
          weekend?

                    DAVID/HELEN
          Yes!

                    JENNY
          A weekend away? I wouldn't be
          allowed to do that.

They all look at her.

                    DAVID
          I'll find a way. I'll talk to
          them.

                    JENNY
          Who?

                                                       36.



                     DAVID
           Jack and Marjorie.

                     JENNY
           About what?

                        DAVID
           Oxford.

Jenny   hoots with derision.

                     JENNY
           You're going to ask my father if
           I can go away with you for the
           weekend? He'd have you arrested.

                        DAVID
           We'll see.

                     JENNY
           I'll bet you you can't do it.

                        DAVID
           How much?

                     DANNY
               (amused)
           Be careful, Jenny. You don't know
           who you're dealing with.

                     JENNY
           Half-a-crown.

                        DAVID
           You're on.

They shake hands. Jenny suddenly notice the clock on
Danny's mantelpiece.

                     JENNY
           Mon dieu! You must take me back
           to school. And I've got to change
           back into my uniform.

There is a silence. Danny and David make momentary eye
contact - they are clearly contemplating the erotic
possibilities of Jenny's last sentence. Helen notices.

                     HELEN
           Oh, behave yourselves.

Jenny looks at them all, mystified.

                                                          37.




30   INT. CLASSROOM/LATIN. DAY.                                  30    

     Jenny is in her Latin class, waiting for the lesson to
     begin. Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on her
     own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from
     Miss Stubbs' English lessons. The girls are different, more
     serious, less fun, and the atmosphere is more sombre. The
     teacher, MRS WILSON, is older, plainer, stricter. She pulls       
     some papers out of her bag.

                         MRS WILSON                                    
               Test results for the Virgil
               translation. We will start from
               the bottom...Patricia.

     Jenny puffs out her cheeks. She's not last.

                         MRS WILSON (CONT'D)                           
               Absent. Margaret. 48%. Jenny...

     Jenny winces.

                         MRS WILSON (CONT'D)                           
               52%. That would just about scrape
               a pass in the exam proper. Not
               good enough for Oxford
               candidates.


31   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                     31

     Jenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa, staring into
     space, clearly upset. On the coffee table in front of them
     is the test, covered in red ink. They hear a key in the
     lock, and they look at each other.

                         MARJORIE
               I'll talk to him.

     Jack enters, back from work. He's wearing a suit and
     carrying a battered briefcase. He looks at them, and then
     notices the essay on the table.

                         JACK
               It's her Latin, isn't it?

                         MARJORIE
               The test didn't...Well, it didn't
               go as well as we'd hoped.

     He picks up the paper.

                                    38.



          JACK
And you still say I shouldn't go
down there and have it out with
whatsername? The Latin teacher?
Because this is hopeless.

          JENNY
How are you going to "have it
out" with her? What are you going
to do? Shout at her until she
decides I'm much cleverer than
she thinks?

          MARJORIE
Everyone's doing their best,
Jack.

          JACK
What if their best isn't good
enough, though, eh? What do we do
then?

          JENNY
We don't go to Oxford. Any of us.
Not even you, Dad.

          JACK
Perhaps it's all a waste of time
and money anyway.

          MARJORIE
You don't mean that.

          JACK
Well, what's she going to do with
an English degree? And if she's
going to spend three years
playing that bloody cello and
talking in French to beatniks,
then I'm throwing good money
after bad. I suppose she might
meet a nice lawyer. But she could
do that at a dinner dance
tomorrow.

          JENNY
Oh, yes. That's the whole point
of an Oxford education. It's the
expensive alternative to a dinner
dance.

          MARJORIE
What about private tuition?

          JACK
Is anyone listening to me? How
much is that going to cost me?

                                              39.



                    MARJORIE
          Five shillings an hour. Maybe a
          little more for A-level.

                    JACK
          Five bob! But... we could spend
          five bob on this and five bob on
          that, and before we know it
          that's our savings down the
          drain.

                    MARJORIE
          And what else are we spending
          five bob on? What else are we
          spending sixpence on?

                    JACK
          Oh, nothing. (He gestures round
          the room.) It's all free. That
          vase was free.

                    MARJORIE
          It was, actually. It was a
          present from Auntie Vi.

                    JACK
          That chair was free. The sofa.
          We don't have to pay for
          anything. And even if we did, we
          don't have to work for it. That's
          the beauty of life, Jenny.
          Everything's free. Grows on
          trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He
          warms to his theme, and grows
          progressively more berserk.)
          We've got a lovely Oxford tree in
          the garden, lucky for you, so
          that's Oxford taken care of. And
          a whole orchard of school trees,
          so that's all free. I'm sure
          there are some private tuition
          trees out there. I'll go and have
          a look.

He stands up.

                    MARJORIE
          Jack...

                    JACK
          No, no, won't take me a minute. I
          think I saw some at the back
          there, right next to the pocket
          money tree. I'll just nip out
          and check, see that they're
          doing all right.

                                                             40.


                Don't want anyone climbing over
                the wall and scrumping, do we?
                And you never know. Maybe
                there'll be a man with deep
                pockets growing out there.
                Because God knows we need to find
                you one.

      He leaves the room, apparently to   look in   the garden   for
      the mythical trees.


31A   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE                                           31A    

      Jenny and her mother move to the window to    watch him
      talking theatrically to the trees.


32    EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY.                                 32     

      Jenny, Hattie and Tina are walking back from school.

                          TINA
                You could always go to
                secretarial college with Hattie.

                          JENNY
                    (sarcastic)
                Oh, thanks.

                            HATTIE
                Charming!

                            JENNY
                Oh, no.

      Hattie and Tina follow Jenny's eyes, and they see Graham
      coming towards them pushing his bike, red-faced, trousers
      tucked into socks.

                            GRAHAM
                Hello.

                          JENNY
                Oh. Graham. Hello.

                          GRAHAM
                I haven't seen you for ages....It
                all went wrong, didn't it? The
                tea-party, I mean. Was it because
                of the year off?

                          JENNY
                No, no. It's just...I've got so
                much to do if I'm going to get
                the grades I need.

                                                          41.



                         TINA
               Yes. She's got no time for boys.

     Hattie and Tina try to suppress giggles. Graham turns an
     even brighter shade of red. Hattie and Tina enter the             
     coffee bar. Jenny feels sorry for him, is on the verge of         
     inviting him to join them...And changes her mind.                 

                         JENNY                                         
                   (quickly)                                           
               Bye, Graham.                                            

     She follows the girls inside.                                     


33   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM/UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                   33    

     Jenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary
     propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks
     away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her
     concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from
     downstairs.


34   INT. JENNY'S HALL. NIGHT                                    34

     She stands outside the living room for a moment, listening.
     She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father,
     and then more laughter from her father and mother.


35   INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                                     35

     David is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to
     mimic all of the Goons. Jack and Marjorie are laughing so
     hard that they can hardly see - they certainly miss Jenny's
     entrance.

                         JENNY
                   (curious)
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Oh. Hello. David does the most
               brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny.
               Actually, he can do all the                             
               Goons.                                                  

                         DAVID                                         
               I don't think I'm very good at                          
               Eccles.                                                 

                         JACK                                          
               Oh, no, you've got him...                               

                                                     42.



                    JENNY
              (impatiently)                                 
          But what's he doing here?

                    DAVID
          I wasn't going to disturb you. I
          knew you'd have your nose to the
          grindstone.

                    JENNY
              (incredulous)
          You came to see Mum and Dad?

                    JACK
          Is that so hard to imagine?

Jenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table.

                     JENNY
          And you're drinking? But it's not
          Christmas!

                    JACK
          Hark at her! Makes us sound as
          though we've signed the pledge.
          You don't know everything about
          us, you know. We had a life
          before you came along.

                    JENNY
          Yes, that's true. I'm only going
          on what I've seen over the last
          sixteen years.

                    MARJORIE
          I'm trying to think what you
          missed. Nothing much comes to
          mind.

                    JACK
          They can't stand to see me
          enjoying myself.

                    JENNY
          Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've
          got a huge pile of Latin
          translation to do.

                    JACK
          You didn't tell me David went to
          Oxford.

Jenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight-
faced.

                    JENNY
          No. I didn't.

                                    43.



          DAVID
For all the good it did me.

          JACK
What did you read?

          DAVID
Oh, English. Just like every
other semi-employed layabout in
London.

          JACK
    (marvelling at the
     coincidence)
English! Which college?

          DAVID
Merton.

          MARJORIE
Isn't that funny?

          JENNY
Extraordinary.

           DAVID
I was just telling Jack that I'm
going back next weekend. I go and
see my old professor every now
and again.

          JACK
That's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track. It's
not always what you know, is it,
David?

          DAVID
Too true. And Clive would love
Jenny. Have you ever come across
Clive Lewis?

          JENNY
Dad has never come across anyone.

          DAVID
I just thought he might know some
of the books.

          JENNY
Dad has never read any books.

          JACK
    (stung)
What's he written?

                                                     44.



                    DAVID
          He wrote a children's book called
          `The Lion, The Witch and The
          Wardrobe' that did very well, I
          believe.

                    MARJORIE
          CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're
          talking about?

                    DAVID
          Well, to us he was just the old
          codger who taught Medieval
          literature. But I came to know
          him very well. We just...got
          along, do you know what I mean?

Everyone murmurs their comprehension.

                    MARJORIE
          Jenny used to love those books.

                    DAVID
          Gosh. That dates me. He was
          writing them when I was there.

                    JENNY
          I'd love to meet him.

There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor.
Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where,
effectively, he is the one being asked.

                    DAVID
          I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the
          uptake. Would Jenny like to come
          with me at the weekend?

                    JACK
          Well, I don't know about this
          weekend. But one day, yes, thank
          you.

                    JENNY
          How often do you see him?

                    DAVID
          Oh, once every couple of years.
          But next time, eh?

                    JENNY
              (disappointed)
          Hopefully I'll be there by then.
          So that won't be much use.

                                                          45.



                         JACK
                   (dubiously)
               Well, I suppose...Would she have
               to stay the night?

                         DAVID
               Well, I wouldn't want to drive
               back after one of those Oxford
               dinners.

     Jack chuckles knowingly.

                         DAVID
               Clive will get her a room in
               college. That's easy enough.

                         MARJORIE
               Sounds like too good an
               opportunity to pass up.

                          JENNY
               Please, Daddy. It would be so
               helpful to know something about
               the place.

                         JACK
               Would it be a bother to you,
               David?

                         DAVID
               I'd be delighted.

     Jack, Marjorie and Jenny all beam.


36   INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT                                         36

     Jenny opens the door for David.

                         JENNY
                   (sotto voce)
               That was scandalous.

                         DAVID
               I told you. You owe me half-a-
               crown.

     He kisses her on the cheek and disappears into the night.


37   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      37

     David and Danny are waiting for the girls to get ready.
     Danny is sitting sprawled in an armchair; David is pacing
     up and down.

                                                          46.



                            DAVID
               Come on!


38   INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM. DAY                                  38

     An ornate four-poster bed occupies most of the space in the
     room. Helen is doing something to Jenny, but we can't see
     what.

                         HELEN
               Nearly ready!


39   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                     39

                         DAVID
               How can they only be nearly
               ready?

                         DANNY
               I wouldn't be surprised if three
               of them come out, you know.
               That's the only explanation.
               They're making themselves a
               friend. LADIES! Let's go. Please.


40   INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM. DAY                                  40

     Jenny is wearing a floaty print dress that she has borrowed
     from Helen, and there are lots of other beautiful clothes
     strewn about the place. Jenny is sitting at the dressing
     table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four
     years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She
     can't believe it. She looks in the mirror, and for a
     moment, she forgets to breathe.

                         HELEN
               There. You'll do. You can keep
               it. I can only wear so many every
               day.

     Jenny emerges from her reverie.

                         JENNY
                   (thrilled)
               Really? Thank you.

                         HELEN
               What about tonight? Will you be
               needing a nightie? Or not?

                            JENNY
               A nightie?

     Jenny suddenly understands what Helen means.

                                                           47.



                         JENNY
               Will we be sharing bedrooms?

                         HELEN
               You're not sleeping with him?

                         JENNY
               No. I'm...No.

                         HELEN
               Good for you.

                            JENNY
               Really? Do     you think so?

                         HELEN
               You're only sixteen. And you
               don't want to get into the
               family way, do you?

                         JENNY
               Oh, I'd make sure that didn't
               happen. I'm going to do it when
               I'm seventeen. On my seventeenth
               birthday, hopefully.

                          HELEN
               With   David?

     Jenny pauses.

                         JENNY
               Well...Golly. I suppose it will
               be with David, won't it?

                         HELEN
               When's your birthday?

                            JENNY
               April.                                                  

                         HELEN
               Oh, he'll be around in April. If                        
               that's what you want. Anyway.
               I'll find you a nightie.

     Jenny stares at herself in the mirror again.


41   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      41

     The girls emerge. Both men are entranced by Jenny's
     transformation. David can't take his eyes off her.

                         DANNY
                   (thoughtful)
               Shall, we, ah... Make a move?

                                                             48.



     He gets to his feet.


42   INT/EXT. CAR COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.                               42    

     The Bristol on the country road to Oxford.


43   INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD DAY                                       43    

     The Bristol drives through Oxford. Jenny catches a quick
     glimpse of a dreaming spire.

                         DANNY
               Imagine spending three years
               here.

                            HELEN
               I know.

     She shudders, as if someone has walked over her grave.

                         JENNY                                           
               Can we stop?                                              

                         DAVID
               Maybe later. There are a couple                           
               of things we have to do.                                  


44   INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD BACK STREET. DAY.                         44    

     Jenny and Helen in the back seat of the car, which is
     parked outside a house in the back streets of Oxford.
     There's no sign of Danny and David. Jenny sighs
     impatiently.

                         HELEN
               Oh, it's always like this. There
               are millions of places I've never
               seen because I've been stuck in
               here.

                         JENNY
               You never get out?

                         HELEN
               There's never anywhere to go in
               the places they stop.

     Jenny looks out of the window. This is self-evidently true.


45   INT. PUB. EVENING.                                            45

     Helen and Danny, Jenny and David are standing in a quiet,
     old-fashioned pub, warming themselves at an open fire.

                                                     49.


David has a pen in his hand, and he's holding a book - `The
Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'.

                    DAVID
          So. Now.Is he Clive, do you
          think? Or CS?

                    HELEN
          I'm confused now. I thought you'd
          made him up?

                    DANNY
              (attempting, briefly, to
               be patient)
          No, we...Never mind.

David walks over to the nearest table and writes in the
book.

                    DAVID
          There.

He stands up, hands the book to Jenny.

                    JENNY
              (reads)
          "To dear Jenny. With the pleasure
          of meeting you. Come and see me
          again soon. Clive."

                    HELEN
          Dirty old man.

Laughter. He takes a long drink from his pint of bitter. A
group of students enter, all carrying musical instruments.
They stand at the bar, waiting to be served. Jenny stares
at them with longing - she wants to be one of them. Helen,
meanwhile, stares at them as if they were aliens.

                    HELEN
              (sotto voce)
          Why are university girls so
          strange-looking?

Helen's right. The girls in the group are all bespectacled
and frumpy. The others laugh.

                    HELEN
          It's true. And they can't all
          have started off that way, can
          they? Most girls aren't ugly, but
          most girl students are. So there
          must be something about those
          places that, you know, makes you
          fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.

                                                     50.



                    DAVID
          Well, if you look at it that
          way...I mean, that's proper
          scientific analysis. And you
          can't argue with science.

Helen looks pleased.

                    HELEN
          I'm still not quite clear on what
          you want to do when you get here.

                    JENNY
          I want to read English.

                       HELEN
          Books?

                       JENNY
          Sorry?

                    HELEN
          You want to read English books?

                    JENNY
          Oh. Yes. Reading English is just
          another way of saying...

                    DANNY
          I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're
          wasting your breath.

                    DAVID
          Anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get
          more of a feel for the place.

                    DANNY
          Absolutely. This would be a good
          place to do a little business.

David catches Jenny's eye. This isn't what he meant by
"getting a feel for the place."

                    DANNY
          All those little old ladies
          wandering around...I'll bet this
          place is rife with stats.

                    JENNY
          Please explain what stats are.
          You're always going on about
          them.

                    DAVID
          All right. Think of a number. Now                 
          think about the most boring                       
          lesson you've ever had at school.

                                                          51.


               Now double it. Done? Doubled? Now                      
               multiply it by the number you                          
               first thought of, and there you                        
               are. That's the official boredom                       
               content of stats.                                      

     Jenny laughs.


46   INT. B & B BEDROOM. NIGHT                                  46

     A rather grotty and certainly unromantic B&B bedroom - so
     unromantic, in fact, that it even has the same fusty
     curtains from Jenny's sitting room. David is in bed, his
     hands behind his head, waiting for Jenny. As far as we can
     tell - he's wrapped up in the sheets quite tightly - he's
     in his underwear. The bedroom is lit unromantically by the
     40-watt overhead light. Jenny comes into the room wearing
     one of Helen's nightdresses, a glamorous satiny item quite
     inappropriate for the occasion or the surroundings. She
     looks nervous.

                         JENNY
               We've got exactly the same
               curtains at home.

                         DAVID
               Let's not talk about curtains.
               You look beautiful. You really
               are a princess.

     Jenny was about to get into bed, but his tone makes her
     pause at the edge of the bed.

                         JENNY
               There's something you should
               know, David. I'm...Well, I'm a
               virgin. And I want to stay that
               way until I'm seventeen.

                         DAVID
               I think that's good. I think
               that's right. And for your
               seventeenth birthday I'm going to
               take you to Paris or Rome or
               Florence and make you feel like
               the most beautiful princess in
               the kingdom of love. But we can
               still be romantic, can't we?

                         JENNY
               Well, yes. Of course we can. If
               it doesn't mean...

                            DAVID
               Minnie....

                                                             52.



                         JENNY
               Is that me?

                         DAVID
               Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse, and
               I'm your bubbalub.

                         JENNY
               Oh. If that's what..

                            DAVID
               Minnie.

                         JENNY
               Yes, David?

                         DAVID
                   (prompting)
               Bubbalub...

                         JENNY
               Sorry. Yes, bubbalub?

                         DAVID
               Would you mind if I had a look at
               what might one day be mine? Just
               a peek?

     His eyes stray to her breasts. Jenny stares at him.

                         JENNY
               You just want to see them?

                         DAVID
               I just want to see them.

     Jenny, flustered and nervous, looks at her nightgown - she
     doesn't know what to do.

                         DAVID
               Let it fall from your shoulders.

     She does so. He stares.

                            DAVID
               Thank you.

     He sits up, and lovingly lifts the straps back up. He
     smiles at her. Relieved, she smiles back.


47   INT/EXT. CAR COTTAGE. DAY                                     47    

     The Bristol, containing David and Jenny in the front seats
     and Danny and Helen in the back, passing through a pretty
     Oxfordshire village. It pulls up outside a country cottage
     with a `FOR SALE' sign outside.

                                                           53.




48    INT. CAR. DAY                                              48

                          DAVID
                Might be worth a look.


49    EXT. CAR COTTAGE. DAY                                      49     

      The four get out of the car, and Jenny follows David and          
      Danny to the front door of the house. Helen hangs back.           

                            HELEN                                       
                Jenny...                                                

      Jenny turns around.                                               

                          JENNY                                         
                Aren't you coming?                                      

                          HELEN                                         
                We don't go in.                                         

                          JENNY                                         
                What are you talking about?                             

                          DANNY                                         
                Helen will look after you. Go and                       
                find a nice cup of tea somewhere.                       

      Jenny is mystified.                                               

                          JENNY                                         
                I don't need looking after, thank                       
                you very much. David, I want to                         
                see...                                                  

      David ignores her.                                                

                          DANNY                                         
                I'm not going to tell you a                             
                second time. Now. Run along.                            


49A   EXT. BENCH. DAY                                            49A    

      Helen and Jenny waiting for the boys. Helen is blithe,            
      chatty; Jenny has a face like thunder.                            

                          HELEN                                         
                They won't be long. Either way.                         

                          JENNY                                         
                "Either way"?                                           

                                                            54.



                         HELEN                                           
               Sometimes they find something,                            
               sometimes they don't.                                     

     In the distance, David is waving at them urgently.                  

                         HELEN                                           
               And when they do find something,                          
               we usually have to leave quite                            
               quickly. They can be a bit                                
               naughty, sometimes. Anyway. It's                          
               nice to have company. I'm usually                         
               outside on my own.                                        

     Jenny stares at Helen. She's beginning to realise who she           
     is dealing with.

52   INT/EXT. CAR NEW COUNTRY ROAD. DAY                            52    

     An old picture of   some kind is wedged between Helen and           
     Jenny on the back   seat. Jenny, furious, is staring out of         
     the window. Helen   attempts to peer around the partition,          
     but settles for a   wave.                                           

                         HELEN                                           
               Coo-ee. Jenny.                                            

     Jenny doesn't respond.                                              

                         DANNY                                           
               Sorry about being a little brisk                          
               back there, Jenny. We have our                            
               way of doing things. Silly,                               
               really.                                                   

     Still no response.                                                  

                         DAVID                                           
               Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not                             
               spoil things.                                             

                         JENNY                                           
                   (disbelieving)                                        
               Me? I'm spoiling things?                                  

                         DAVID                                           
               I think there must be some kind                           
               of misunderstanding.                                      

     Jenny shakes her head bitterly. They continue driving in            
     silence.                                                            

                                                          55.




53   EXT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      53    

     The Bristol pulls up outside Danny's Bedford Square flat.

                         DANNY
               Who wants to come up   for a
               drink?

                         DAVID
               Jenny?

                         JENNY
                   (still furious)
               No thanks. You go. I'll find my
               own way home.

     Jenny gets out of the car and starts up the road. David
     gets out and starts to chase after her.

                         DAVID
               Jenny!

     He catches up with her in the street.

                         DAVID
               It was an old map. A Speed. It
               was cooped up in that miserable
               little cottage, and she didn't
               even know what it was. What a
               waste! It shouldn't spend its
               life on a wall in wherever the
               hell we are. It should be with
               us. We know how to look after it
               properly. We liberated it.

     Jenny snorts derisively.

                         JENNY
               Liberated! That's one word for
               it.

                         DAVID
                   (quickly and
                    passionately)
               Oh, don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
               You're better than that. I know
               you have fun with us. I can see
               it. You drink everything I put in
               front of you down in one, every
               last drop, and then you slam your
               glass down on the bar and ask for
               more, and it's wonderful. We're
               not clever like you, so we have
               to be clever in other ways,
               because if we weren't, there
               would be no fun.

                                                          56.


               We have to be clever with maps,
               and..and.. You want to know what
               stats are? Stats are old ladies
               who are scared of coloured
               people. So I move the coloureds
               in and the old ladies move out
               and I buy their flats cheap.
               That's what I do. So now you
               know.

     Jenny nods reluctantly.

                         DAVID
               And if you don't like it, then I
               will understand, and you can go
               back to Twickenham and listen to                       
               the Home Service and do your
               Latin homework. But these
               weekends, and the restaurants and
               the concerts..They don't grow on
               trees.

     Jenny looks at him, startled. Trees again?

                         DAVID
               Do you understand? Of course you
               do. This is who we are, Jenny.

     He turns to face her and holds out his hand. On Jenny: is
     she in or out? Jenny takes his hand. David pulls her
     towards him, holds her around the waist and begins to dance
     with her. Further up the pavement, Helen and Danny watch,
     laughing.


54   EXT/INT. CAR JENNY' HOUSE. NIGHT                           54    

     David pulls up in the Bristol outside Jenny's house, and
     they sit in the dark for a little while.

                         DAVID
               I suppose you have homework to
               do.

                         JENNY
               Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank
               you. I had a nice time.

                         DAVID
                   (surprised, despite his
                    speech earlier)
               Really? In spite of the, the
               incident? With the map?

                         JENNY
               As you said in the car, it was a
               misunderstanding.

                                                     57.



                    DAVID
          Exactly. A muddle.

                    JENNY
          You have no idea how boring
          everything was before I met you.

                    DAVID
          I hope that there's something
          more than excitement to our
          relationship.

                    JENNY
          Excitement's a lot, when you're
          at school and you live in
          Twickenham.

                    DAVID
          You know what I'm trying to say.
          I want you to like me for who I
          am, not just what I can do for
          you.

                    JENNY
          But that is who you are. I've
          never met anyone like you. Action
          is character, our English teacher
          says.

                    DAVID
          What does that mean?

                    JENNY
          I think it means that if we never
          did anything, we wouldn't be
          anybody. And I never did anything
          before I met you. And sometimes I
          think no-one's ever done anything
          in this stupid country, apart
          from you.

                    DAVID
          That's a good place to end the
          weekend. I'll give you a tinkle.

                       JENNY
          Thank you.

They look at each other. David is clearly smitten. He moves
towards her. He wants to kiss her, but he doesn't want to
frighten her - in the end, Jenny makes it easy for him and
moves towards him. They kiss gently and tenderly.
Flustered, Jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and
goes inside while David watches.

                                                          58.




55   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                  55

     Jenny enters the sitting room with her overnight bag to
     find the radio on, her father reading the paper and her
     mother knitting. When Jenny comes in, Jack beams. He has
     clearly turned some kind of corner.

                         JACK
               Here she is! The wanderer
               returns!

                         MARJORIE
               Did you have a nice time?

                         JENNY
               Lovely, thank you.

                         JACK
               Was he nice to you?

     Jenny unzips her bag and pulls out her copy of the book.
     She hands it to her father.

                         JENNY
               Look inside.

     Jack examines the inscription.

                         JACK
               Well I never. Look at this,
               Marjorie.

     He hands it to her. She examines it reverently.

                         MARJORIE
               "Clive"...Lucky girl. What was he                      
               like?

                         JENNY
               He was just...normal. Kind.

                         MARJORIE
               And did he show you round?

                         JENNY
               Oh, he was busy. David did,
               though.

                         MARJORIE
               What did you think?

                            JENNY
               Beautiful.

                                                     59.



                    MARJORIE
          Did it make you want to work
          harder?

                    JACK
          Never a dull moment with David,
          is there? If it's not concerts,
          it's famous authors. Bit
          different from that lad you
          brought home for tea, isn't he?

                    MARJORIE
          David's a lot older than Graham.

                    JACK
          Graham could live to be two
          hundred, and he still wouldn't be
          swanning around with famous
          authors. Hasn't got it in him.

                    JENNY
          He might become a famous author,
          for all you know.

                     JACK
          Being one isn't the same as
          knowing one, is it? Anyone can be
          one. But if you move in those
          circles...

                    JENNY
          What?

                    JACK
          Well, it says something about
          you, doesn't it? It says you're
          going places. It says you're well
          connected. He's an impressive
          young man, that David. I like him
          more and more.

                    MARJORIE
          Well, they say opposites attract,
          don't they? I wouldn't have
          thought he was your sort.

                    JACK
          He wasn't. And now he is.

                    MARJORIE
          Is that how you feel, Jenny?

                    JENNY
          I feel....I Feel I should do my
          homework.

She leaves the room. Marjorie watches her go thoughtfully.

                                                          60.




56   EXT. PARK. DAY                                              56

     A group of girls cross-country running. Jenny and her             
     friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher ,       
     jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on.         

                         GYM TEACHER                                   
               Ladies, please. Christmas is                            
               coming.                                                 

     They put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her, and then            
     immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching.          
     Seeing an attractive bench, they sit down. From somewhere         
     under a skirt, Jenny produces a packet of exotic-looking
     cigarettes and offers them around.

                         HATTIE
               What the hell are those?

                         JENNY
               Russian Sobranies.

     Hattie and Tina make snooty faces. Jenny takes a cigarette.
     The others follow suit. Jenny lights them, and they all
     grimace. The contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes,
     and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced.

                         HATTIE
               Where did they come from?

                         TINA
               She might have bought them from
               the Savoy, or Claridges, or the
               opera, or some fancy nightclub.
               Who knows, with Jenny?

                         JENNY
               Paris. You can't buy them here.

                         TINA
                   (suddenly looking at
                    her suspiciously)
               You never bought them yourself?

                         JENNY
                   (mimicking Tina's
                    grammar cruelly)
               No. I never.

                         TINA
               Shut up, you stuck-up cow.

                         JENNY
               But I'll bring you some back, if
               you want.

                                               61.



                    TINA
          You're joking.

                       JENNY
          Non.

                    HATTIE
          He's taking you to Paris?

                       JENNY
                 (smiling smugly)
          Oui.

                       HATTIE
          This term?

                       JENNY
          Peut-etre.

                    TINA
          Isn't it your birthday next
          Tuesday?                                    

                       JENNY
          Might be.

The two friends shriek and jump up and down.

                    HATTIE
          Oh, my God! Your birthday!

                    TINA
          I wouldn't like to be you. All
          those dinners you've had off him.
          Ouch.

                    JENNY
          You have such a Victorian
          attitude to sex, you two.

                    TINA
          Oh, sorry, Dr Kinsey. We're not
          all as experienced as you. I
          mean, you've done it...(She
          counts on her fingers) I make it
          never! Can that be right?

                    HATTIE
          But your parents are just going
          to let you swan off like that?

                    JENNY
          They don't know yet. David's got
          a plan, he says. He usually has
          something up his sleeve.

                                                          62.



                         TINA
               I've noticed that. What did he
               tell them when you had your
               weekend in Oxford?

                         JENNY
                   (animated by the memory)
               Oh, it was....(She changes her
               mind) David went to Oxford.
               Merton. English. And he offered
               to show me round.

                         HATTIE
               So you have a good-looking
               boyfriend with pots of money,
               brains and a nice car.

                         JENNY
               Apparently I do.

     Tina makes a bitter face.

                         TINA
               And they tell us there's a God.

     Laughter. Jenny glances off into the distance, and spots a
     portly middle-aged woman heading in their direction.

                         JENNY
               Sod. Miss Davies.

     They stand up, grind their Sobranies into the mud, kick
     them under the bench, and set off at a brisk trot. The
     Sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo.


57   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                      57

     Breakfast on Jenny's birthday. Jenny is at the table
     buttering toast. Jack is reading the paper, Marjorie is
     cooking him eggs and bacon.

                         JACK
               Is David taking you somewhere
               special tonight?

                         JENNY
               Not that I know of.

                         MARJORIE
               I've asked Graham round for tea
               and birthday cake.

                         JENNY
               Graham?

                                                         63.



                         JACK
               What do we want him round for?

                         MARJORIE
               I happened to be talking to his
               mother about something, and...

                         JENNY
               What did you happen to be talking
               to her about?

                         MARJORIE
               I thought it would be nice.

                         JENNY
               What if David turns up?

                         MARJORIE
               Are we expecting David to turn
               up?

     Jenny shrugs.

                         JACK
               It might not be a bad thing if he
               did.

                         MARJORIE
                   (doubtful)
               Really?

                         JACK
               Well, if you think about it,
               there's more than one way of
               skinning a cat.

                         JENNY
               And who's the skinned cat, in                         
               this enchanting image? Me?

                         JACK
               No, of course...                                      

                         JENNY                                       
               I have an education to pursue.                        


58   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                               58

     Graham, Jenny and her father are at the dinner table,
     sitting in the dark. Marjorie kicks the door open with her
     foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen
     candles burning on it. She puts it down carefully on the
     table.

                                                           64.



                          JACK
                Blow them out, then, before the
                whole place burns down.

      Jenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her
      candles. Her father and mother both look at her, apparently
      attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the
      lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two
      unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same
      size - clearly books.

                          MARJORIE
                Who'd like a piece?

      In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising
      specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a
      couple of slices which immediately collapse.

                          GRAHAM
                Never mind. I'll have one of
                those.

                          JACK
                Come on. Presents.

      Without any real enthusiasm, Jenny opens the first one of
      the two, from her mum and dad. It's a Latin dictionary.

                          JENNY
                Oh. Thank you. I    needed a new
                one.

                          GRAHAM
                    (crestfallen)
                Oh dear.                                                 

      The doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer it,
      and immediately the house is energised: it's David.


58A   INT/EXT JENNY'S HOUSE                                       58A    

      Jack answers the door to David.                                    


58B   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE                                          58B    

                          JACK (O.S.)
                Good grief. You won't believe
                this, Jenny. Did you leave
                anything in the shop?

      David enters. You can hardly see him for all the parcels
      and flowers he's carrying.

                          DAVID
                It's a special day.

                                                     65.



He and Jenny exchange a glance. Jack comes in behind him.

                    JACK
          She's a special girl.

                     DAVID
          Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello,
          young man.

                    JENNY
          This is Graham.

                    DAVID
          Graham, a pleasure. I'm David.

They shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younger.

                    JACK
          Makes your dictionary look a bit
          feeble, eh Graham?

Graham looks pained. Marjorie notices.

                    MARJORIE
          And ours too, come to that.

                    JACK
          Well, we're not the ones trying
          to impress her.

                     JENNY
          Clearly.

                    JACK
          David, what can I get you to
          drink?

                    DAVID
          What's everybody else having?
          What have you got there, Graham?

                    JACK
          I've given him a glass of pop.

                    GRAHAM
              (stung)
          I'd better be going I have a
          stack of homework to do.

Graham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye,       
but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door.            

                     DAVID
          Yes. Well. You can put the pop
          away now. What is there for the
          grown-ups?

                                                     66.



                    JACK
          A glass of something warming?

                    DAVID
          You know me so well.

Hearty laughter from the two men.

                    JENNY
          Can I open anything yet?

Marjorie comes back into the room.

                    MARJORIE
          Wait for me.

                    DAVID
          Before you start on that little
          lot , I have a surprise. Next
          weekend, we're all going to Chez
          Georges to celebrate Jenny's
          birthday.

                    JACK
              (flatly)
          Lovely.

                    DAVID
          Chez Georges is in the Boulevard
          St Germain. In Paris.

Jenny giggles her delight. Jack's smile is a little more
forced.

                    JACK
          How d'you mean, Paris?

                    JENNY
          You know the one, Dad.

                    JACK
              (panic rising)
          But..We haven't got any French
          money. And I'm not sure...I just
          don't think it would agree with
          me.

                    JENNY
          Dad!

                    JACK
          They don't like us, the French,
          you know. John Sutton at work
          went once. They were very rude to
          him. I'm not sure I'd like that.

                                                     67.



Jenny understands David's ploy perfectly, and the role she
must play. Her eyes fill with tears. Jack notices.

                    JACK
          I don't want to spoil anyone's
          fun, but...It's not for me,
          Europe. We'll go another time.

                     JENNY
               (bitterly)
          You've just said you don't like
          Europe. What's going to change?
          It'll have to be Europe, won't
          it? Because it isn't going to be
          you.

                    MARJORIE
          I can take her.

                    JACK
              (genuinely indignant)
          To France? And leave me here on
          my own?

                    JENNY
          Oh, for God's sake.

Jack looks cornered. He needs to find a way out.

                    DAVID
          Listen, I'm really sorry to have
          caused all this to-do. I just
          thought it might be nice. But
          I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle
          Daniel. They can have your
          tickets.

Jack looks at him.

                    JACK
          Aunt Helen? The one who went to                     
          the concert with you?                               

                    DAVID
          Yes, that's the one.

                    JACK
              (relieved)
          Well, there we are.

                    DAVID
              (perplexed)
          Where are we?

                                                          68.



                         JACK
               Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If
               Aunt Helen's going to be
               there...

                          DAVID
                   (the penny apparently
                    dropping)
               Of course!

                         JACK
               I didn't want to put a spoke in
               anyone's wheels. But if you look
               at it from my angle...A bachelor,                        
               taking my daughter off to
               Paris...

                         DAVID
               Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought
               it through properly. I do
               apologise, Jack. Would you prefer
               it if Helen took Jenny on her
               own? I don't mind. I've been to
               Paris before.

                         JACK
               Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No,
               no. If Aunt Helen's going...

     He smiles broadly. He's off the hook. Jenny catches David's
     eye and smiles.


59   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          59    

     Hattie, Tina and Jenny are sitting on their desks, waiting
     for a lesson to start. Hattie shows Jenny a piece of paper
     which apparently contains some kind of shopping list.

                         TINA
               There are some things you must
               buy for us, and some things you
               only have to buy for us if you're
               a proper, true friend. (She
               points at Hattie, then at
               herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel
               perfume. (She repeats the
               gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel
               lipstick. What have I forgotten?

                         HATTIE
               Those funny cigarettes you were
               smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets
               each.

     A very small girl, twelve or thirteen, comes in to the
     classroom and approaches Jenny.

                                                          69.



                         SMALL GIRL
               Are you the girl going to Paris?

     Tina, Hattie and Jenny stare at her.

                         SMALL GIRL
               Well are you or aren't you?
               Because I'd like some perfume.

     Miss Stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and
     essays. She sees the small girl and shoos her out. She then
     approaches Jenny and whispers discreetly into her ear.

                         MISS STUBBS
               Jenny, the headmistress would
               like a word at the end of the
               lesson. I'm afraid that the
               legend of Mr Rochester may have
               travelled further than you
               intended.

     Jenny looks at her, startled and a little sick.


60   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY.                           60

     The office is dark, wood-panelled, foreboding, apparently
     designed to put all visitors ill-at-ease. The headmistress
     would probably choose to be wood-panelled if she could.
     She's tweedy, bespectacled, severe. There is a knock at the
     door. She doesn't look up from her paperwork.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               Come.

     Jenny enters, looking young and frightened.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               Ah. Miss Mellor.

     Jenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she
     can muster.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               We're all very excited about your
               forthcoming trip to Paris. Our
               excitement, indeed, knows no
               bounds. Some of us can talk of
               little else.

     Jenny looks at her feet.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               An older man, I understand. A
               word of warning, Miss Mellor.

                                                             70.


               There may well have been the odd
               sixth-form girl who has lost an
               important part of herself -
               perhaps the best part - while
               under our supervision. These
               things happen, regrettably. If,
               however, we are made aware of
               this loss, then of course the
               young lady in question would have
               to continue her studies
               elsewhere, if she still has any
               use for `A'-levels. Is that
               clear?

                         JENNY
               Can I go now?

                          HEADMISTRESS
               Please.                                                   

     Jenny turns round and walks out without saying another
     word.


62   INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. EVENING                                   62    

     62PT 1                                                              

     Through the window of a hotel suite, we see a BEA jet               
     soaring into the sky.                                               

     62PT 2                                                              

     David and Jenny aren't on it, though. They are letting
     themselves into the room. Jenny stares at the featureless           
     sitting room.

                         JENNY
               There's no bed.

                         DAVID
               Ah. I pushed the boat out and got
               us a suite.

                          JENNY                                          
               A suite!                                                  

                         DAVID
               Well, if work stops us getting to                         
               Paris until tomorrow, then work                           
               can buy us a nice hotel room.                             
               Anyway, it's a special occasion,
               isn't it?

                         JENNY
               I would have thought that tonight
               of all nights we only need a
               bedroom.

                                                               71.



     Close on David's reaction      -   she hasn't forgotten that
     tonight's the night.


63   INT. HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT                                       63

     David and Jenny in bed, in a dimly lit bedroom. They are
     kissing - David more passionately than Jenny. He is making
     little whimpers of excitement, and Jenny is clearly trying
     hard to hide her nerves. We're acutely aware of her age,
     and of her virginity. Suddenly David breaks off.

                          DAVID
               Hold on a second. I've got
               something.

     Rather absurdly, he half-disappears over the side of the
     bed, reaching for something on the floor. He comes back
     with a banana. Jenny stares at him.

                         JENNY
               What on earth is that for?

                         DAVID
               I thought....I thought we might
               want to practice.

     Jenny shrieks with horror.

                         JENNY
               With a banana?

                         DAVID
               I thought we'd get the messy bit
               over with first.

                         JENNY
               David, I don't want to lose my
               virginity to a piece of fruit.

                            DAVID
               I'm sorry.

     David attempts to kiss her again. Jenny wriggles clear.

                         JENNY
               Let's wait until we get to Paris.
               I think the moment might have
               gone.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry, Minnie. I'm such a
               fool.

     Jenny doesn't deny it.

                                                          72.



                         JENNY
               And David..... if tomorrow night
               does happen, it will never happen
               again, so...

                         DAVID
                   (alarmed)
               Why won't it ever happen again?

                         JENNY
               Because the first time can only
               happen once.

                           DAVID
                     (relieved)
               Oh.

                         JENNY
               So, please...No Minnies. No baby-
               talk. I'm not old enough for baby-
               talk. Treat me like a grown-up.

     David looks chastened.

                         JENNY
                   (brightly)
               I know. Let's go and sit in our                        
               sitting-room.

                          DAVID
                   (cheered up)
               Hooray! I'll order some
               champagne.

     Jenny looks at him with what might, from one angle, be
     construed as fondness.

     MONTAGE SEQUENCE - PARIS


64   EXT. LEFT BANK. DAY.                                       64

     Juliette Greco on the soundtrack. Jenny leans against a
     wall, the Seine and Notre Dame behind her. David takes her
     picture. She looks fantastic in the clothes David has given
     her for her birthday.


65   INT. ART GALLERY. DAY                                      65

     A crowded Left Bank gallery. Jenny is sitting on the floor
     watching an impossibly handsome young Frenchman paint black
     the body of an impressively passive naked woman. The young
     man sitting next to Jenny gives her an appraising look.
     David, standing at the back and looking square and
     uncomfortable, notices.

                                                          73.




66   INT. RECORD SHOP. DAY                                        66

     We see three listening booths, all containing customers.
     Jenny and David are in the middle booth, listening to the
     Juliette Greco song on the soundtrack. (For a moment, the
     sound quality changes - soundtrack becomes source music,
     seamlessly.) Jenny is studying the sleeve. She wants to hug
     herself, she's so excited.


67   EXT. CAFE. EVENING.                                          67

     A Left Bank cafe - David and Jenny are eating steak frites
     outside, drinking vin ordinaire, watching the world go by.
     They are both anticipating the night ahead.


68   EXT. VIEW OF SACRE COEUR/MONTMARTRE                          68


69   EXT. PARIS HOTEL. DAWN                                       69    

     Jenny is smoking at the second-floor window of a simple,
     pretty Parisian hotel, wearing a glamorous-looking slip and
     looking at the street life below her.


70   INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN                                        70    

     The bedroom is simple and romantic - everything the airport
     hotel wasn't. David is lying amid rumpled sheets, smoking
     what is clearly a post-coital cigarette, and watching Jenny
     from behind.

                         DAVID
               Do you still feel like a
               schoolgirl?

     Jenny turns round, smiles, shakes her head.

                         DAVID
               And it wasn't too uncomfortable?

                         JENNY
               Not after the...first bit. It's
               funny, though, isn't it? All that
               poetry, and all those songs and
               films, about something that lasts
               no time at all?

     David looks at her. She isn't being cruel. She just doesn't
     know any different. She returns to her people-watching. He
     smokes ruminatively.

                                                          74.




71   EXT. PARK. DAY                                             71

     ...Jenny in her games kit, smoking her Sobranie with her
     friends on the park bench again. Hattie and Tina are
     examining their bottles of Chanel reverently. Jenny is back
     to being her seventeen-year-old self; somehow her seventeen-
     year-old self looks comical, and no longer appropriate.

                         TINA
               How can you go back to double
               French when you've had a weekend
               with an older man in a posh hotel
               in Paris? You wouldn't catch me
               coming anywhere near this dump.

                         JENNY
                   (artfully)
               It wasn't all glamour. We spent
               half the weekend at Heathrow in a
               hotel suite .

                         HATTIE
               A suite? Oh my God. Your life.

     They smoke their Sobranies ruminatively.

                         TINA
               You're going to miss it. All the
               swanning around in posh hotels.

                         JENNY
               Why will I need to miss it?

                         TINA
               When you go to Oxford. Unless
               you're planning on being with
               David forever.

     Jenny doesn't say anything.

                         HATTIE
               You're not, are you?

                         JENNY
                   (distracted)
               God, no.

                         TINA
               So? Won't you miss it?

     Jenny shrugs. Clearly she will, and clearly she hasn't
     thought about it before.

                         HATTIE
               We'll miss it.

                                                          75.



     Jenny laughs.


72   INT.   CLASSROOM. DAY                                      72

     Jenny's English class file past Miss Stubbs at the end of a
     lesson. Miss Stubbs stops Jenny.

                          MISS STUBBS
                Jenny, could I have a word?

                          JENNY
                Of course.(To Hattie and Tina)
                I'll catch you up.

     Miss Stubbs waits until the room empties.

                          MISS STUBBS
                You can do anything you want,
                Jenny. You know that. You're
                clever and you're pretty... But
                sometimes those things fight. I'm
                worried that at the moment clever
                Jenny and pretty Jenny are
                fighting.

                          JENNY
                What do you mean?

                          MISS STUBBS
                I couldn't bear it if clever
                Jenny lost. It's because of
                people like you that I plough
                through illiterate essays by
                Sandra Lovell about her pony. And
                there aren't many of you, I can
                tell you. One every few years. Is
                your boyfriend interested in
                clever Jenny?

                          JENNY
                I think so.

                          MISS STUBBS
                Interested enough to let her do
                what she wants?

                          JENNY
                He couldn't stop me.

                          MISS STUBBS
                He might not have to stop you.
                That's what I'm trying to tell
                you.

                                              76.



                    JENNY
              (frustrated)
          I'm not sure what you're trying
          to tell me.

                    MISS STUBBS
          I'm telling you to go to Oxford.
          No matter what. Or you'll break
          my heart.

Jenny looks at her.

                    JENNY
              (quietly)
          Where did you go?

                      MISS STUBBS
          Sorry?

                    JENNY
              (louder, bolder)
          Where did you go? Which
          university?

                    MISS STUBBS
          Girton. Cambridge.

                      JENNY
          Oh.

                    MISS STUBBS
          What does that mean? `Oh'?

                    JENNY
          You're clever. And you're pretty.
          So presumably, Clever Miss Stubbs
          won. And here you are, reading
          all those pony essays. I don't
          know. These last few months, I've
          been to Paris, and to jazz clubs,
          and I've eaten in wonderful
          restaurants, and seen wonderful
          films, heard beautiful music...

                    MISS STUBBS
          I'm sure you have. But I was
          filled up with beautiful things,
          books and music and conversation,
          in exactly the same way at
          Cambridge. And I didn't have to
          pay the same sort of price. Are
          you taking precautions, Jenny?

Jenny stares at her angrily.

                    JENNY
          It's nothing to do with that.

                                                          77.



                            MISS STUBBS
               Isn't it?

                         JENNY
               Maybe our lives are always going
               to end up with pony essays. Or
               housework. And yes, maybe we'll
               go up to Oxford. But if we're all
               going to die the moment we
               graduate, maybe it's what we do
               before that counts.

                         MISS STUBBS
               I'm sorry you think I'm dead.

                         JENNY
               I don't think you're dead. But...

                         MISS STUBBS
                   (coldly)
               You'd better get to your next
               class.

     She turns her back on Jenny.


73   EXT. CAR. NIGHT                                             73

     Helen, Danny, Jenny get out of David's Bristol, which is
     parked outside a nightclub called Esmerelda's Barn. David
     has parked next to a white Rolls-Royce.

                          JENNY
                   (looking at the Rolls-
                     Royce)
               And we know the person who owns
               this?

                         DAVID
               Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a....

                            DANNY
               A bastard.

     Danny and David laugh.

                         DAVID
               He's a business acquaintance, and
               we need to talk to him.

                         JENNY
               I gathered that much. But why do
               we have to crawl around the West
               End looking for his car? Why
               don't you just make an
               appointment, if you want to see
               him?

                                                          78.



     The men snigger.

                         DANNY
               What? Ring his office? Talk to
               his secretary? That isn't how it
               works with him, dear.


74   INT. CLUB. NIGHT                                           74

     The four walk in and take their coats over to the
     cloakroom. The club is a smoky West End club, full of            
     smartly-dressed and dubious-looking men, and young,
     glamorous, dubious-looking women. Jenny and Helen look out
     of place - Helen too ethereal, Jenny too innocent. There is
     jazz playing.

                         DANNY
               There he is.

     We see a nasty-looking man in his late 30s/early 40s. He is
     wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar. He's
     standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier-
     looking man in a dark suit.

     They find a table at the back and sit down. A waitress
     comes over to their table.

                         DAVID
               A bottle of champagne, please.

                         DANNY
               Oh-ho. Champagne, eh?

     He looks at Jenny and David expectantly.

                         DAVID
               Don't be bashful.

                         HELEN
               No. Be Sneezy.

     Everyone ignores her.

                         DAVID
               All right, then. If you won't
               tell them I will. Jenny got two
               As and a B in her mock-A levels.

                            DANNY
               Fantastic.

                         HELEN
               Congratulations.

                            JENNY
               Thank you.

                                                           79.



                         DAVID
               The B was in Latin. But it's much
               better than it was, isn't it,
               Minnie?

     Rachman is now standing on his own. Danny nudges David, and
     they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives.
     The waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two
     glasses. The girls smile and clink glasses.

                         HELEN
               Don't worry.

                         JENNY
               About what?

                         HELEN
               Someone told me that in fifty
               years no-one will speak Latin,
               probably. Not even Latin people.
               So you shouldn't mind too much
               about your B.

     Jenny stares at her, trying to think of a response.


75   INT. CLUB. NIGHT                                            75

     Danny and David are at the bar, having just finished
     talking to Rachman. Danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes         
     his head.                                                         

                         DANNY
               Well, I'm not sure you'd want him                       
               to marry your sister. I'm not                           
               even sure you'd want to talk to                         
               him in a night-club, come to                            
               that.                                                   

     They both chuckle. There is a silence for a moment.

                         DANNY
                   (gently)
               You do know what you're doing,
               old chap? With Jenny?

                         DAVID
               This is the one, Danny.

                         DANNY
               We've heard that before.

                         DAVID
               You can see she's different.
               She's got everything. You've got
               Helen, and....

                                                          80.



                         DANNY
                   (drily)
               And you've got Helen with brains.

                            DAVID
                      (rumbled)
               Yes.

                         DANNY
               I don't want to see her hurt.

     They make their way back to their table.


76   INT. CLUB. NIGHT                                            76

     While David and Helen watch, Danny and Jenny dance. Danny's
     a good dancer; Jenny is nervous at first, but becomes more
     comfortable and more expressive, with Danny's help.

                         JENNY
                   (knowing that she should
                    make conversation, as
                    all the couples around
                    her are doing)
               Have you...Have you bought any
               more paintings recently?

                         DANNY
               Have I? Let's think? Oh, I picked
               up a little Piper the other day.
               A good `un, I think.

                         JENNY
               I'm still trying to work out what
               makes good things good. It's
               hard, isn't it?

                         DANNY
               The thing is, Jenny, you know,
               without necessarily being able to
               explain why. You've got taste.
               That's not even half the
               battle. That's the whole war.

     Jenny smiles at him with gratitude. There is a sudden
     closeness between them. David is watching them carefully.
     They return to their table.

                         DAVID
               Jenny, we should go. It's late.

                         JENNY
                   (disappointed)
               Oh. Yes.

                                                           81.



                         DANNY
               Alas. One day, school will be
               over forever, and we can talk
               about art all night.

                         DAVID
                   (to Danny)
               You're all right in a taxi,
               aren't you?

     He guides Jenny firmly out of the club.


77   EXT. CLUB. NIGHT.                                           77

     Jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the
     Bristol, but David stops her.

                         DAVID
               Wait there.

     He runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts
     rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything
     but the thing he's looking for.

                         JENNY
               What are you doing?

     He slams the boot shut and comes back empty-handed.

                         DAVID
               Will you marry me?

     Jenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs.

                         JENNY
               What were you looking for?

                         DAVID
               I thought I had a ring. It
               wouldn't have been the right one.
               But it would have done for
               tonight.

                          JENNY
                   (eyes twinkling with
                    amusement)
               Oh, David.

                         DAVID
               I'm serious.

                         JENNY
               You're very sweet.

                         DAVID
               What do you think?

                                                          82.



                         JENNY
                   (helplessly)
               Please take me home.

     She gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's
     face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams
     the door on Jenny after she's got in.


78   EXT. SCHOOL YARD. DAY                                        78    

     Jenny, Tina and Hattie all smoking in the school toilets.
     Jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others.
     Tina looks at her.

                         TINA
               How do you say `A penny for your
               thoughts?' in French?

                         HATTIE
               A franc is too much, isn't it?

                         TINA
               For her thoughts, yes. You'd be
               overpaying by about ninety-nine
               centimes.

     Suddenly the door bursts open and the Latin teacher comes
     in.


79   INT. HEAD'S OFFICE. DAY                                      79

     The three girls are lined up in front of the headmistress,
     hands by their sides.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               I'm surprised that you two are
               standing in front of me. I'm not
               surprised to find you here, Miss
               Mellor, though I do feel rather
               like the judge who sent Al Capone
               to prison for tax evasion. We
               take a very dim view of smoking.
               We take an even dimmer view of
               some of your other behaviour,
               which as far as we know has taken
               place off school premises. Your
               appearance here today, however,
               allows me to remind you that we
               are trying to teach you how to
               become young ladies, not
               nightclub hostesses. In reality,
               of course, you are neither. You
               are merely silly little girls.
               Detention after school. Go away.

                                                             83.



      Jenny's face sets hard. Something in her shuts down.


80    EXT. JENNY'S BALCONY. EVENING                                80     

      Jenny is smoking on the balcony.                                    


80A   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM.                                        80A    

      Jenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but
      she can't concentrate. Her hair is tied back in a pony-
      tail. She gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of
      the window. We see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street
      at night. She looks back at her desk. It looks even more
      boring than the street. She looks at her scrubbed seventeen-
      year-old face in the mirror - so much younger than the
      Jenny we have seen with David. She makes herself up, and
      she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. In her           
      make-up and her school uniform, she's half-woman, half-
      child. We hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the
      radio, the washing-up, occasional muffled conversation.
      Jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs.


81    INT. KITCHEN. EVENING                                        81

      Jenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and
      listening to the radio. They have their backs to the door.
      Jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment

                          MAN ON THE RADIO
                They do need some looking after,
                but nothing that will require too
                much work. Just leave them in
                your potting shed for a couple of
                weeks, and they'll look after
                themselves.

                          JACK
                Oh, aye. The potting shed. Who
                does he think I am? Prince
                Rainier of Monaco?

                          JENNY
                What if I got married instead of
                going to college?

      Jack and Marjorie turn around and stare at this strange
      apparition wearing too much make-up and a school uniform.

                           JACK
                Married?

                           JENNY
                Married.

                                                     84.



                    JACK
          It would depend who it was,
          surely?

                    JENNY
          Would it? That's interesting.

                    JACK
          Course it would. I wouldn't want
          you married off just for the
          sake of it.

                    JENNY
          Thanks.

                    MARJORIE
          Has somebody asked you?

                    JENNY
          Yes.

                    JACK
          Who?

Marjorie rolls her eyes.

                    MARJORIE
          What did you tell him?

                    JENNY
          Nothing yet.

                    JACK
          David?

                    JENNY
          No. A man I just met walking his
          dog.

                    JACK
          David's asked you to marry him?
          Bloody hell. Pardon my French.

                    MARJORIE
          Do you have any choice? Or is it
          too late.

She looks at her daughter knowingly. Jack merely looks
confused.

                    JACK
          Of course she's got a choice. But
          it's an interesting one, isn't
          it?

                                                            85.



                         JENNY
               This is where you're supposed to
               say, "But what about Oxford?"

                         JACK
               Well. Looked at it one way, you
               wouldn't really need to go now,
               would you? He's a man going
               places. And say what you like,
               but they know how to take care of
               their money, don't they? He'll
               see you're looked after.

                         JENNY
                   (quietly, turning the
                    words over in her
                    mouth)
               I wouldn't need to go. Would you
               like to expand on that?

                         JACK
               You know what I mean.

     Jenny laughs bitterly. She can't believe it.

                         JENNY
               All that Latin! All those essays!
               What was the point? Why didn't
               you just send me out prowling
               round nightclubs? It would have
               been less trouble. And I might
               have had more fun.

                         JACK
               We don't know about nightclubs.
               We knew about education. Anyway,
               it all turned out for the best.

                           JENNY
               How?

                         JACK
               He wouldn't have wanted you if
               you were thick, would he?

     Jenny stares at them and walks out.


82   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          82

     English. Miss Stubbs is standing at the front   of the class,
     holding a copy of King Lear, and listening as   various
     members of the class massacre the text. Some    are messing
     about by overacting; others read to the best     of their
     ability, tonelessly and with no understanding   of the words.

                                                       86.


Lear himself is being read by Ann, the bespectacled girl      
from the first scene. She's no King Lear, and she's one of
the bad readers.

                    GIRL 1
          May not an ass know when the cart
          draws the horse? Sings whoop jug
          I love thee.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Yes, when it says `Sings', it
          means he sings those words.

Girl 1 looks at her blankly.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Never mind. Lear...

                    ANN                                       
          Does any here know me. This is
          not Lear. Does Lear walk thus?

                      TINA
                (sotto voce, to Jenny,
                 in the seat next to
                 her)
          No.

Jenny starts to giggle.

                    ANN                                       
          Speak thus?

Tina shakes her head.

                    ANN                                       
          Where are his eyes?

Tina doesn't need to say anything - she just looks at
Jenny, makes a pair of spectacles with her fingers and
squints. Jenny's giggling fit increases in intensity.

                    ANN                                       
          Either his notion weakens, or his
          discernings are lethargied. Ha!
          Waking? Tis not so. Who is it
          that can tell me who I am?

Jenny's arm shoots up, as if to answer the question.

                    JENNY
          Ooh. Miss. Me. I can.

Miss Stubbs looks at Jenny more in sorrow than in anger -
Jenny's behaviour now is something new in their
relationship. Jenny stares back at her defiantly. Suddenly
Miss Stubbs notices something glinting on her hand: an
engagement ring.

                                                       87.



                       MISS STUBBS
          Oh, Jenny.

She is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken.

                       JENNY
          What?

                    MISS STUBBS
          Take it off.

Hattie, who is sitting behind Jenny, notices the ring, too,
for the first time.

                    HATTIE
          Oh my God. Is that really what I
          think it is? I'M GOING TO BE A
          BRIDESMAID!

There is an excited susurration in the classroom.

                    MISS STUBBS
          You know there's a school rule
          about jewelry.

                    JENNY
          Half the girls in this room are
          wearing jewelry.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Yes. But none of it is going to
          ruin their lives.

                    JENNY
              (coolly)
          We have a difference of opinion
          on that.

Miss Stubbs stares at her. Jenny can only just steel
herself to stare back.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Let's see who's right. Come with
          me.

Jenny doesn't move.

                    MISS STUBBS
          Please don't make me drag you out
          like a child.

Jenny gets to her feet. Teacher and pupil leave the room,
while the rest of the class watches.

                                                    88.




83   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                      83

                         HEADMISTRESS
               How far advanced are these
               ridiculous plans? Have you set a
               date? Have you decided on a
               church?

                         JENNY
               We won't be getting married in a
               church. David's Jewish.

     The headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware,
               I take it, that the Jews killed
               our Lord?

                         JENNY
                   (beginning to feel less
                    intimidated by her
                    surroundings)
               And you're aware, I suppose, that
               our Lord was Jewish?

     The headmistress snorts scornfully

                         HEADMISTRESS
               I suppose he told you that. We're
               all very sorry about what
               happened in the War. But there's
               no excuse for that sort of
               malicious and untruthful
               propaganda.

     Jenny smiles to herself.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               Anyway, I can now see that you
               are even more in need of
               responsible advice than I
               realised. Is it true that you
               don't intend to sit for your
               exams? And therefore you won't be
               applying for University?

                         JENNY
               Yes, that's right.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               What do you think you're doing?

                         JENNY
               Nobody has been able to explain
               to me the point of University.

                                                     89.


          Therefore I don't see the point
          of the exams, either.

                    HEADMISTRESS
          Nobody does anything worth doing
          without a degree.

                    JENNY
          And nobody does anything worth
          doing with one, either. No woman,
          anyway.

                    HEADMISTRESS
          So what I do isn't worth doing.
          Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs
          Wilson, or any of us here.

Jenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her
silence as an admission of defeat.

                    HEADMISTRESS
          Because none of us would be here
          without our degrees, you realise
          that, don't you? And yes, of
          course studying is hard, and
          boring, and...

Jenny can't contain herself any longer.

                       JENNY
          Boring!

                       HEADMISTRESS
          I'm sorry?

                    JENNY
          Studying is hard and boring.
          Teaching is hard and boring. So
          you're telling me to be bored,
          and then bored, and then finally
          bored again, this time for the
          rest of my life. This whole
          stupid country is bored. There's
          no life in it, or colour in it,
          or fun in it. It's probably just
          as well that the Russians are
          going to drop a nuclear bomb on
          us any day now. So my choice is
          either to do something hard and
          boring, OR to marry my... my Jew,
          and go to Paris and Rome and
          listen to jazz and read and eat
          good food in nice restaurants and
          have fun. It's not enough to
          educate us any more, Mrs Walters.
          You've got to tell us why you're
          doing it.

                                                          90.



                         HEADMISTRESS
               Because without formal
               qualifications...

     She grinds to a halt. She has never had to answer this
     question before.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               It doesn't have to be teaching,
               you know. There's the Civil
               Service.

     Jenny stands up.

                         JENNY
               I don't wish to be impertinent,
               Mrs Walters. But it is an
               argument worth rehearsing. You
               never know. Someone else might
               want to know what the point of it
               all is, one day.

     She leaves the office.


84   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                            84

     Jenny is half-walking, half-running, towards the school
     gates. She's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. All
     that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly
     over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. She
     looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger
     girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. Jenny
     doesn't even look round when she goes through the school
     gates.


85   INT. KITCHEN. EVENING                                       85

     Later. Jenny and Marjorie are sitting at the kitchen table.
     Jack is standing over them; he hasn't even taken his coat
     off, or put his briefcase down.

                         JACK
               How d'you mean, left?

     Jenny doesn't answer.

                         JACK
               What about your exams?

                         JENNY
               I'm not sitting them.

                         JACK
               What are we going to tell people?

                                                          91.



                         JENNY
                   (witheringly)
               Oh, telling people. I'd forgotten
               that what we tell people is more
               important than anything.

                         JACK
               All that...

     Marjorie knows what he's going to say, and doesn't want him
     to.

                         MARJORIE
               Jack!

                         JACK
               No. No need for Jack. She should
               hear it. All that money! Do you
               know how much it's cost me for
               you to go through school and take
               no exams?

                         JENNY
               I'm sure David will pay you back.
               Send him a bill. As you said, he
               wouldn't have wanted me if I was
               dim, so he should fork out. Just
               tell me why there's a point in
               sitting my exams, and there's no
               point in me going to University.

     Jack gapes at her. He's floundering.

                         JACK
               You know what your trouble is,
               don't you? You're too clever by
               half.

                         JENNY
               In which case I should have left
               school years ago, shouldn't I?
               Ask them for the money back. If
               I'm too clever by half, you
               overpaid by a third.


86   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. NIGHT                                     86

     Danny, Helen, David and Jenny are in Danny's flat; we have
     just missed The Announcement - there is champagne already
     open. Danny glances quickly and discreetly at David, who
     catches his eye.

                         HELEN
               That's...Gosh. That's fantastic
               news.

                                                              92.



     Danny isn't so pleased.

                          DANNY
                   (cool)
               Congratulations.

     There is much chinking of glasses.

                         HELEN
               I thought you'd see sense about
               university.

     Jenny smiles.

                         HELEN (CONT'D)
               You'll stay pretty now.

     Laughter from David and Jenny.

                         JENNY
               Am I still allowed to read?

                         HELEN
               English? Books?

     More laughter.

                         HELEN (CONT'D)
               You won't be laughing when she
               goes all speccy and spotty,
               David.

     Helen is bemused by their mirth. Danny watches   David
     thoughtfully.


87   EXT. DANNY'S. NIGHT                                            87    

     David and Jenny come out of Danny's flat and approach                
     David's car.                                                         

                         JENNY
               Danny didn't seem very pleased
               about our engagement.

                         DAVID
               I thought that, too! I was
               wondering whether he might be a
               bit jealous.

                         JENNY
                   (trying not to be
                    pleased)
               Jealous?

                                                           93.



                          DAVID
                You may have noticed that Helen's
                not really Oxford material. I'm
                going to keep him out of your
                way.

      They both smile. David opens the door for Jenny and she            
      gets into the car.                                                 


87A   INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN. DAY                                   87A    

      Jenny is making David a cup of tea. Her mother is keeping          
      an eye on Jenny - in Marjorie's mind at least, this is a           
      rehearsal for something.                                           

                          DAVID                                          
                I haven't put my...my stamp on it                        
                yet. Haven't had time. It needs a                        
                woman's touch, really. And if you                        
                don't like it, we can move. Just                         
                say the word.                                            

                          JENNY                                          
                Where is the flat again?                                 

                          MARJORIE                                       
                You have to put the cosy on                              
                straight away.                                           

      Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes. She picks up the hand-             
      knitted tea-cosy and puts it on her head.                          

                             JENNY                                       
                Like that?                                               

      David laughs.                                                      

                          MARJORIE                                       
                    (oblivious)                                          
                No. On the tea-pot.                                      

                            JENNY                                        
                      (deadpan)                                          
                Ah.                                                      

      She puts the tea-cosy on the tea-pot.                              

                          DAVID                                          
                Just down from Russell Square.                           
                Two minutes' walk from the                               
                underground.                                             

                                              94.



                    MARJORIE                         
          Jenny! We could walk to...(She             
          tries to think of somewhere Jenny          
          might find interesting.) We could          
          walk to the British Museum!                

Jenny gives her a look.                              

                    MARJORIE                         
          I'll leave you to it. Don't let            
          it stew.                                   

She leaves the room.                                 

                    JENNY                            
          And this is where you're living?           

                    DAVID                            
          I've stayed there for the last             
          couple of nights. (Beat) On and            
          off.                                       

                    JENNY                            
          You've stayed there two nights             
          "on and off"?                              

                    DAVID                            
          Is that tea ready? One sugar,              
          please.                                    

                    JENNY                            
              (frustrated by his                     
               evasions)                             
          David!                                     

                    DAVID                            
          I'm sorry. You must think I'm              
          very odd.                                  

                    JENNY                            
          No, but.... You seem to float              
          around. I never know where you             
          are.                                       

She hands him his tea.                               

                    DAVID                            
          A wandering Jew.(He pauses to              
          take a sip.) If I tell you                 
          something, will you promise not            
          to laugh?                                  

                    JENNY                            
          It depends on how funny it is.             

                                                          95.



                         DAVID                                          
                   (mumbling)                                           
               I live at home.                                          

                         JENNY                                          
               We all live at home.                                     

                         DAVID                                          
               No. I mean...I live at home...in                         
               the same way that you live at                            
               home.                                                    

                         JENNY                                          
               But I live with my mother and                            
               fa...(It clicks.) You don't mean                         
               it.                                                      

     David nods, shamefacedly.                                          

                         JENNY                                          
               Your mother and father?                                  

                         DAVID                                          
               Just my mother. My father's dead.                        
               I've been meaning to tell you,                           
               Minnie, and it would have been                           
               much better than all those silly                         
               lies. But...                                             

     He looks quite upset. We warm to him. Jenny leans over and         
     takes his hand.                                                    

                         DAVID                                          
               Anyway. You can see how much I                           
               need you. And you won't regret                           
               this, I promise. We'll have so                           
               much fun. And just think. When we                        
               get married, you won't have to                           
               wait in the car while I do my                            
               business.. You'll be waiting at                          
               home, looking at the Burne-Jones                         
               on the wall. Home, Minnie. Our                           
               home. Can you imagine?                                   

     Close on Jenny. She can't imagine, really.                         


90   INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                         90    

     Jenny, Tina and Hattie in the coffee bar. Jenny is eagerly
     scanning the English literature exam paper.

                                                             96.



                         JENNY
               Did you do this one? "Show from
               any TWO scenes in `Pride and
               Prejudice' how far it is true
               that Jane Austen's methods are
               `essentially dramatic'".

                         HATTIE
               Three scenes.

                         JENNY
               It says two here. Look.

     She shows the paper to Hattie. Hattie slumps onto the
     formica table and groans.

                         HATTIE
               Two. Two. Two. I can't believe
               it.

     Tina rubs Hattie's head sympathetically.

                         TINA
               It was an unfair question. You're
               hopeless at maths. What do you do
               all day, anyway, Lady Muck?

     Jenny shrugs.

                         JENNY
               I've been looking at flats. I've                          
               been to look at dresses. I've
               been reading a lot, too.

                         TINA
               Reading, trying on dresses...
               Where did we go wrong?

                         JENNY
               What's this afternoon?

                         TINA
               French. The translation paper.

     Jenny is lapping it all up. She might even be envious.


91   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                   91

     Jenny and Marjorie are in the sitting room, all dressed up
     and waiting for David to come and pick them up. Jenny looks
     great, as usual; her mother looks smart, if somewhat old-
     fashioned.

                                                     97.



                    MARJORIE
          Don't worry. He'll find a nice                       
          place in no time. He sees plenty                     
          of them.                                             

                    JENNY                                      
          I'm not sure he sees plenty of                       
          nice places.                                         


          Would you like a radiogram for a
          wedding present? We love ours.

Something about this depresses Jenny. Marjorie notices.

                    MARJORIE
          You won't be bored, you know.
          He's not boring.

Now they are both thoughtful. As if on cue, Jack comes into
the sitting room, pulling at his tie, looking apprehensive.
He appears to be wearing Brylcreem. He looks like a little
boy who has been made to put on his Sunday best.

                    JACK
          What sort of things can you have
          for starters? I mean, how will I
          know what are starters and what
          aren't? I'm all right if it's
          soup or fruit juice. But if it's
          anything more than that...

                    JENNY
          We've been through this, Dad.
          It'll be quite clearly marked on
          the menu.

The doorbell rings. Jack stiffens. Jenny goes to answer the
door.

                    JACK
          Why don't you three go out? I'll
          be happy here with a tin of...

David enters the room. He is relaxed, happy. He has worn a
tie, possibly because he knew that Jack would wear a tie.
Jack and Marjorie stand, and they exchange greetings.

                    DAVID
          Everybody ready? I think you'll
          like this place, Jack. Their wine
          list is as good as anything I've
          seen in London.

                    JACK
          Someone told me that.

                                                          98.



                         JENNY
               David, probably. Who else would
               it have been?


92   EXT. STREET/JENNY'S HOUSE NIGHT                              92    

     Jack and Marjorie approach David's Bristol.

                         JACK
               I was hoping you'd take us in
               this.

                         DAVID
               Oh, you won't want to go in
               anything else after tonight. Mind
               you, it drinks petrol. I'm afraid
               we'll have to stop on the way in
               to town.

     He opens the back door for his future in-laws.

                         DAVID
               Madame. Monsieur.

     They get in, he closes the door, runs round to open the
     front passenger door for Jenny.


93   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                              93

     David starts the car, and glances in the rear-view mirror.

                         DAVID
               Everyone happy?

                         JACK
               I feel like Eamonn Andrews.

                         DAVID
               Is that a good thing?

                         MARJORIE
               Of course. Eamonn Andrews is the
               poshest person that Jack can
               imagine being.


94   EXT. STREET/PETROL STATION. NIGHT                            94    

     The Bristol cruises down a London arterial road.


95   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                              95

     We see, from David's POV, a petrol station approaching.

                                                          99.



                         DAVID
               Sorry about this.

     He slows the car and turns in to the garage.


96   EXT. GARAGE. NIGHT                                          96

     David gets out of the car as the attendant comes over.

                         ATTENDANT
               How can I help you, sir?

                         DAVID
               You might as well fill her up.

     David looks around and spots a phone box just outside the
     garage. He leans in through the open car window.

                         DAVID
               I'm just going to make a quick
               call. I'll be two ticks.


97   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                             97

     Jenny watches him walk towards the phone box.

                         JACK
               Do you think we should offer him
               some petrol money? Or would he
               feel insulted?

     Jenny watches David as he dials the number. He notices her,
     waves, puts the money in the slot.

                         JACK
               He'd feel insulted, probably. He
               said tonight was his treat. That
               must include the petrol, for
               God's sakes?

     David starts to talk, and turns away, as if he's frightened
     that someone in the car can lip-read.

                         JACK
               What do you think?

     Nobody pays him any attention. They lapse into silence.
     Jack starts to fiddle with the features in the car - a
     table springs down from the seat in front of him, much to
     his alarm.

                         JACK
               God almighty. What have I done?

                                                         100.



     Jenny opens the glove compartment, looking for the
     cigarettes that David always keeps there. She finds the
     cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. But she has
     seen something in there, so she opens it again. She takes
     out some letters and papers and starts to look through
     them.


98   EXT. GARAGE. NIGHT                                           98

     David has finished his phone call and is walking towards
     the car. He sees Jenny looking through letters and papers,
     sees the open glove compartment, starts to run across the
     forecourt.

                         DAVID
                   (desperately)
               Jenny!

     It's too late. We see Jenny's stricken face, gleaming in
     someone else's headlights.


99   INT. CAR. NIGHT                                              99

     David gets into the car.

                         DAVID
               Jenny, I...

                         JENNY
                   (as cold as ice)
               Take us home.

                         JACK
               What's going on?

                         DAVID
               There's been a...Jenny's had a
               bit of a shock.

     Jenny laughs, mirthlessly, then starts to weep.

                         JACK
               What's happened?

                         JENNY
               It's another one of David's
               little muddles and
               misunderstandings.

                         DAVID
               Jenny, it's not...

                         JENNY
               I don't want to hear another word
               from anybody. Take me home. NOW.

                                                          101.



      Marjorie and Jack look at each other. David swings the car
      around and they drive home in silence; Jenny cries
      constantly, without making a sound.


100   EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                  100

      The Bristol draws up outside Jenny's house. David jumps out
      of the car and lets Marjorie and Jack out. Jack starts to
      walk towards the house and then stops.

                          JACK
                    (desperately)
                You can sort this out, can't you,
                David?

      Jenny gets out of the car too.

                           DAVID
                Of course I can. She's just got
                the wrong end of the stick about
                something.

                          JENNY
                Go inside, Dad.

      Jenny and David watch Jack and Marjorie go into the house.
      The moment the door is closed, Jenny walks towards David.
      She's holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the
      glove compartment. She starts to throw them at him, one by
      one.

                          JENNY
                Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and                        
                Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs                           
                David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David                         
                Goldman..                                               

      When she has thrown the last one, she flies at David - she
      slaps him, punches him, scratches him. David tries to grab
      her hands, but she's too wild.

                          DAVID
                Just let me...

                          JENNY
                You're MARRIED!

                          DAVID
                Legally, yes, but...

      Finally he manages to subdue her. She leans against the
      car, distraught.

                          JENNY
                When were you going to tell me?

                                                    102.



                    DAVID
          Soon. It just - it never seemed
          the right time. You seemed so
          happy, and I was happy, and...It
          would have spoiled everything.
          What can I do, Minnie? What can I
          do? How can...

                      JENNY
          "Oh,   Jenny. I'm just too busy to
          find   somewhere to live...I live
          with   my mummy." You were living
          with   your wife! All this time!

                       DAVID
          Jenny...

                    JENNY
          What's your address?

David gestures vaguely.

                       JENNY
          Where?

                    DAVID
          Byron Avenue.

                    JENNY
          Byron Avenue! It's no wonder we
          kept bumping into each other,
          then, is it? What number?

                    DAVID
          There's no point..

                    JENNY
              (screaming)
          WHAT NUMBER?

                       DAVID
          Seventeen.

Jenny picks one of the envelopes up off the ground and
looks at it.

                    JENNY
              (bitterly sarcastic)
          Good grief. It's the truth.

                    DAVID
          Please. You have to understand. I
          was with you just about all the
          spare time I had.

                                                    103.



                    JENNY
          Spare time? Spare time? I can't
          tell you how grateful I am.

                    DAVID
          Don't be like this.

                    JENNY
          I have nothing. I left school. I
          didn't take my exams. Where's it
          all gone, now? I gave my life
          away.                                                

                    DAVID
          Jenny, I can get a divorce.
          Everything will turn out for   the
          best. You'll see.

We can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace
curtains anxiously.

                    JENNY
          Go and tell them. Go and tell
          them, then go and tell your wife.
          I want to see you. I want to
          stand there and watch.

David stands on the pavement, looking towards the house. He
looks away; he can't make eye contact with Jenny's parents.

                    DAVID
          They're not going to listen to me
          now. Let me come round tomorrow.
          When everyone's calmed down a
          bit.

                    JENNY
              (suddenly desperate)
          Please don't leave me to tell
          them on my own. Please. You owe
          me that much. You owe them that
          much.

                    DAVID
              (sadly)
          I owe them a lot more than that.
          I owe them everything. They gave
          me you.

He opens the boot. It's full of cases of whiskey. Jenny
doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. David
takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.

                    JENNY
          Two minutes. And then I'll come
          out and drag you in.

                                                          104.



      Jenny marches into the house and slams the door. The camera
      stays on David. He gets back into the car and takes
      another slug of whiskey. Then his shoulders begin to
      shake, and he cries and cries.


101   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                   101

      Jenny comes in, leaving the door open for David. Her
      parents are standing in the sitting room, looking at her
      anxiously. Their coats are still on, and they haven't put
      the lights on yet.

                          JACK
                What's going on?

                          JENNY
                He's helping himself to some
                Dutch courage before facing you.
                Stolen Dutch courage, from the
                look of it. He has something to
                tell you.

      She stands, pale and young-looking again, opposite her
      parents. Suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights.
      Shot from their POV of the Bristol roaring off up the
      street.

                          JACK
                He just drove off.

      We close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd
      drive off!

                          JACK
                    (pathetic)
                Can you tell us? Please? Jenny?

      Jenny can't deal with her own pain, let alone his. He
      already looks like a broken, foolish old man. They should
      hug. But they don't.


102   EXT. STREET/DAVID'S HOUSE. DAY                              102    

      A suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far
      from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively -
      she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young
      again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't
      bring herself to wear anything that David bought her.

      She hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house,
      steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the
      door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She
      is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned.
      But there's more to come.

                                                    105.


The woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into
the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David
has found time to father another baby.

                       WIFE
          Oh. Hello.

                    JENNY
              (almost inaudible)
          Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must
          have the wrong house.

The woman stares at her.

                    JENNY
          Yes. I wanted number...It's my
          cello lesson. Silly. I...

She dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.

                    WIFE
          Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God.
          You're a child.

Jenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up
the driveway, but the woman won't let her go.

                    WIFE
          No. No. You stay here. If you're
          old enough to sleep with him,
          you're old enough to look at me.

                       JENNY
          I can't.

But she doesn't move, either.

                    WIFE
          You didn't know about any of
          this. Presumably.

Jenny shakes her head.

                    WIFE
          No. They never do. Did he ask you
          to marry him?

Jenny nods.

                    WIFE
          Yes. Of course he did. You're not
          in the family way, are you?
          Because that's happened before.

Jenny shakes her head.

                                                          106.



                          WIFE
                Thank God for that. At least you
                can escape intact. (Beat)
                Relatively speaking. Not all of
                them have done.

      She nods at the children.

                          WIFE
                That's why he never goes through
                with anything. He does love them.

                          JENNY
                    (looking into the pram)
                She's beautiful.

                          WIFE
                Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's
                four months old.

      Jenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself
      from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken.

                          JENNY
                Four months!

                          WIFE
                Yes. Babies often are that sort
                of age. Perhaps you can remember
                a night four months ago when he
                seemed a little distracted.
                Anyway. If you'll excuse us.

      She pushes past Jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the
      path.


103   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                     103

      Marjorie and Jack are in the kitchen. Marjorie is sipping
      tea, shoulders hunched, defeated. Jack is pacing around the
      room, furious. Normal life has clearly been suspended
      during this crisis. Jenny walks in.

                          MARJORIE
                Did you see her?

                          JENNY
                I saw her. I didn't talk to her.
                There wasn't any need.

                          JACK
                Well we've got to have this out.
                If you won't do it, I will.

      He starts for the door.

                                                          107.



                          JENNY
                    (contemptuously)
                Sit down.

                          JACK
                I beg your pardon? I'm still your
                father, Jenny.

                          JENNY
                Oh, you're my father again, are
                you? What were you when you
                encouraged me to throw my life
                away? I'm a silly schoolgirl.
                Was, anyway. Silly schoolgirls
                are always being seduced by
                glamorous older men. But what
                about you two?

                          JACK
                We didn't...

      He gives up hopelessly. Marjorie says nothing.

                          JENNY
                And now I've got nothing.
                I'm...I'm broken.

      Jack looks at her.

                          JACK
                That doesn't mean....what I think
                it means, does it? It can't.

                          JENNY
                What are you talking about?

                          JACK
                Just tell me that you
                didn't...you haven't, you
                know...You didn't....                                   

      Jenny looks at him in disbelief.

                          MARJORIE
                    (to Jack)
                I wondered how stupid you were.
                Now I know.


104   INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                                  104    

      Jack stands outside Jenny's bedroom door with a cup of tea.
      He knocks tentatively.

                                                             108.




105   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                           105

      Close-up of the floaty print dress that Helen gave her. The
      dress is suddenly jerked out of shot, and we pull back to
      reveal a weeping Jenny stuffing it violently into an
      already full box of things she is throwing out. The
      contents represent her now-despised, David-created adult
      self. We can see Juliette Greco albums, photos, expensive-
      looking jewelry boxes. She continues to stuff things into
      the box. There's a knock on the door.

                            JACK (O.S.)
                Jenny.

      She continue to put her David-life away into bags. She
      ignores him.


106   INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                                     106    

      Jack is almost in tears.

                          JACK
                There's a cup of tea for you
                here.

      No answer. He puts the tea on the floor, and sits down next
      to it.

                          JACK
                I know I made a mess of
                everything.

      He waits for an answer - nothing.

                          JACK
                All my life I've been scared, and
                I didn't want you to be scared.
                That's why I wanted you to go to
                Oxford. So that if someone asked
                you out to a nice restaurant, you
                wouldn't panic about what was a
                starter and what was a main
                course. And then David came
                along, and he had money, and he
                knew famous writers, and he knew
                how to get to classical music                              
                concerts. But he wasn't who he                             
                said he was. He wasn't who you
                said he was, either.


107   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                           107

      Jenny is about to rip a poster off the wall, but she
      pauses.

                                                           109.




108    INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                                  108    

                           JACK
                 The other day, your mother and I
                 were listening to a programme
                 about CS Lewis on the radio, and
                 they said he moved to Cambridge
                 in 1954. And I said to Marjorie,
                 Well, they've got that wrong,
                 because how would our Jenny get
                 her book signed, if he wasn't in
                 Oxford?


109    INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                        109

       Jenny's face crumples. She knows he's right.

                           JACK (O.S.)
                 Jenny, I'm sorry.


109A   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                  109A      

       Jenny is sitting on the sofa in Danny's flat. Danny and           
       Helen are in dressing gowns; there are newspapers strewn          
       around. Danny pours her a brandy. Helen is sitting next to        
       her, holding her hand.                                            

                           HELEN                                         
                 I don't really understand what                          
                 difference it makes. When I found                       
                 out that...                                             

                           DANNY                                         
                 Helen! Not now.                                         

       Helen shrugs.                                                     

                           DANNY                                         
                 I tried to tell him. I'm not                            
                 speaking to him now, if that's                          
                 any consolation.                                        

                           JENNY                                         
                     (bitterly)                                          
                 It's a funny world you people                           
                 live in. You both watched me...                         
                 carrying on with a married man,                         
                 but you don't think it's worth                          
                 saying anything.                                        

                                                          110.



                          DANNY                                         
                Ah, well if you want that sort of                       
                conversation...You watched David                        
                and I help ourselves to a map,                          
                and you didn't say much, either.                        

      He holds Jenny's gaze. She looks away.                            


110   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                            110    

      Jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it
      completes a circle. She's back where she started from, or
      would like to be, anyway. If she seems older than she did
      when we first met her, it's because things have happened to
      her, and they've left a mark on her face. She's worried and
      tired. The headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her
      return - but only because of the opportunities for smugness
      and schadenfreude it provides.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                So. Your Jewish friend turned out
                to be married already, I
                understand. How unfortunate.

      Jenny doesn't say anything. She has clearly decided to
      swallow anything she has to.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                Anyway. How do you think we can
                help?

                          JENNY
                I'd like to repeat my last year
                at school. Start all over again.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                I got the impression the last
                time we spoke that you didn't see
                the point of school. Or of me, or
                of any of us here.

                          JENNY
                I know. I was stupid.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                So what is the point?

                          JENNY
                I know that I need to go to
                university.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                And what happens if some other
                chap wants to marry you during
                your studies next year?

                                                          111.



                          JENNY
                    (laughing bitterly)
                Some other chap? There won't be
                any other chaps. Not for a long,
                long time, anyway.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                I'm afraid I think you're the
                sort of young lady who attracts
                chaps whether she wants to or
                not. No,I think the offer of a
                place at this school would be
                wasted on you. You showed how
                little you valued us only weeks
                ago. And I must confess that it
                gives me a sort of grim
                satisfaction to return the
                sentiment now.

                          JENNY
                    (bitterly)
                Is it really so grim, your
                satisfaction?

                          HEADMISTRESS
                It gives me no pleasure to see
                our schoolgirls throw their lives
                away. Although, of course, you're
                not one of our schoolgirls any
                more. Through your own volition.

                          JENNY
                I suppose you think I'm a ruined
                woman.

                          HEADMISTRESS
                Oh, you're not a woman.

      Beat. Jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word. The
      headmistress is pleased with her final line.


111   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                        111

      Jenny working hard in her room. It's been completely
      stripped bare of everything except schoolbooks. She has
      become ageless, genderless - her life is now monastic.


112   EXT. PARK. DAY                                             112    

      Jenny walking alone through her old park.                         

                                                          112.




113   INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       113    

      Jenny on her own, smoking nervously. Hattie and Tina come
      in. They obviously haven't seen her since it all happened.
      They both hug her sympathetically and sit down. Nobody
      knows what to say.

                          TINA
                I'm sure my uncle knows someone
                who could kill him. If that would
                help.

      Jenny smiles wanly, and briefly.

                          HATTIE
                We should have stopped you.

                          JENNY
                Did you want to?

                          TINA
                Of course we didn't. Why would we
                stop you? Restaurants, hotels,
                foreign cities, no exams...

                          JENNY
                    (Bitterly)
                Yes. Who'd have thought there'd
                be a down side to all that? I
                could tell you all about the
                imagery in Jane Eyre. But I
                couldn't see that a man who stole
                maps from old ladies might be a
                liar.

      They look at her. This is new information.

                          HATTIE
                Well, if you'd told us that we
                might have tried to stop you.

                          JENNY
                There are a lot of things I
                didn't tell you. I was dreaming.

                          TINA
                That's the thing about our lives,
                isn't it? It's so easy to fall
                asleep, when there's nothing to
                keep you awake.

      Beat.

                          HATTIE
                Are you getting on with the work
                all right on your own?

                                                          113.



      Jenny thinks.

                          JENNY
                    (heartfelt)
                No. No, I'm not.


114   EXT. STREET MISS STUBBS FLAT. DUSK.                         114    

      Jenny in a suburban street. She's looking for an address.
      She finds the house, walks down the path, rings on a bell.
      Miss Stubbs comes to the door.

                            MISS STUBBS
                Jenny!

      It's a warm greeting. She ushers her inside.


115   INT. MISS STUBBS' FLAT. DUSK.                               115

      It's a proper Bohemian flat, up in the eaves. There are
      books and papers and paintings covering every available
      surface. Jenny looks around. Finally, for the first time,
      we see her in somewhere she can feel at home.

                          JENNY
                This is lovely.

      Miss Stubbs makes a face.

                          JENNY
                But it is. Really. I'd love to

                Oh, it's not hard. Go to Oxford
                and become a teacher and this is
                what you end up with.

                an original. Do you like him?

116   EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY                                 116

      Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on        
      Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her
      precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling
      through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her
      for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and
      leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave
      it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:
      it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road
      just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she
      can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a           
      littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of           
      cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,           
      stops, then walks towards her.

                                                    115.



                      DAVID
          Jenny.

Jenny says nothing.

                    DAVID
          Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell
          you that I am going to ask my
          wife for a divorce.

Jenny looks at him disbelievingly.

                    JENNY
          Don't you understand what you've
          done?

David looks at her. This isn't going to be as easy as he
thought.

                    DAVID
          I can see my behaviour must have
          been... confusing. But we've
          never sat down and had a proper
          chat about it all. About the whys
          and wherefores. They can wait.
          The important thing is that
          you're still my Minnie Mouse, and
          I love you, and you had fun. You
          know you had fun.

                    JENNY
          Yes. I had fun. But I had fun
          with the wrong person, at all the                    
          wrong times. And I can't ever get
          those times back, now.(Beat)                         
          Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every                    
          day I wake up and pinch myself.
          And when I think how close I                         
          came...                                              

She looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a
dream. A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts,
leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her
to finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man
offers her his arm. They walk away together, and David
stares longingly after them.

          INT      PAPAL APARTMENT      DAY
          
          CLOSE ON an ornate ring.     It's intricately carved with a seal, an
          image of St. Peter casting a net.     The ring is carried on a satin
          pillow through a darkened, regal apartment.     In the distance,
          BELLS ARE TOLLING   -- the slow, solemn tones that announce a death.
          
          A dozen men in scarlet cassocks, ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINALS, bend
          down to inspect the ring, nodding in affirmation, part of an
          ancient ritual.
          
          A younger man (the CAMERLENGO) in a black cassock takes a silver
          knife and scratches the ring's seal twice, once horizontally and
          once vertically, in the sign of the cross.
          
          Now the ring is placed on a lead block.    The Camerlengo raises a
          silver mallet and SMASHES it down, shattering the ring into a
          thousand tiny pieces.
          
          As the Cardinals confirm to their satisfaction that the ring has
          been destroyed, the HUSHED VOICE of a NEWS REPORTER comes over the
          image.

          the Cardinals file out in a solemn procession. Behind them, the
          Camerlengo closes and locks the doors to the apartment entrance,
          helped by an AIDE who stretches red silk across the doors in the
          form of an X.

          SCIENTISTS and TECHNICIANS read off checklists in a variety of

          At the front, CARDINAL MORTATI stands behind a massive altar, arms
          outstretched, praying in Latin for the assembled luminaries.
          
          As he performs the service, intoning in a dead language --
          
          INT      ANTIMATTER LAB      DAY
          
          --- Vittoria steps through an airlock and emerges in a gleaming
          white underground lab.     Everything, everywhere, is white.
          
                                             5.
          
          
          
          There are a dozen columns of polished steel about three feet tall,
          each of which supports a transparent canister the size of a tennis
          ball can.    They appear empty.
          
          LEONARDO BENTIVOGLIO, sixtyish, black pants and a short-sleeve
          black shirt, is at work at a command console in the center of the
          room.    (They speak to each other in Italian, subtitled.)

          He turns around, and we thought his black pants and shirt looked
          familiar -- now we see his Roman collar and realize this physicist
          is also a priest.

          While Leonardo and Vittoria work at the console, we move slowly
          across the room toward those strange vertical pillars.
          
          INT       ST.   PETER'S BASILICA        DAY
          
          In St. Peter's, we're in a complimentary move, down the aisle past
          the College of Cardinals, one hundred sixty-five aging men in
          brilliant red robes, seated near the altar.

                             Conclave literally, the word means
                             "with key" -- the process by which
                             the Church chooses a new leader for
                             the world's one billion Catholics.
          
          We move onto the altar, close enough to Mortati to get a good look
          at him.    He's in his late seventies, grave, eyes closed in
          religious fervor as he consecrates the communion host.

          In the lab, we're still moving, close to one of the pillars and to
          the transparent tube on top of it.    The tube isn't empty, as we
          first thought, there's something suspended in the middle of it, a
          drop, round and white, floating in mid-air.
          
          INT      ST.    PETER'S BASILICA        DAY
          
          Mortati reaches the religious climax of the ceremony and holds
          aloft the round white communion host.
          
                                         6.
          
          
          
          A THOUSAND VOICES begin singing in St. Peter's, we go in close on

          --- that otherworldly drop, also round and white, a perfect match
          for the host, but so different, hovering in the tube like a hot
          blob of mercury, defying gravity.
          
          Everything abruptly goes black and a title bleeds on screen:

          knife through the water, doing laps.
          
          The swimmer is the only one in the pool, but still pushes like
          he's got someone to beat.    His strokes echo off vacant bleachers
          in an oldish college natatorium.
          
          As he reaches the end of the pool, he sees a murky figure through
          the water.    The swimmer stops, pulls off his goggles.
          
          ROBERT LANGDON is fiftyish, but looks ten years younger, must have
          something to do with two hundred laps at dawn every day.

          He heads for the locker room.        Vincenzo calls after him.

                            They said to show you this.
          
          Langdon turns back. Vincenzo's holding a single sheet of paper in
          his right hand. Langdon, curious, makes his way back to him.
          Takes the paper ---
          
          --- and, it is safe to say, feels the earth give way beneath his
          feet.     He looks up, eyes wide, and mutters a single word:

          upside down.

                           It's called an ambigram, the same
                           backwards and forwards. That's common
                           in a symbol, like a Jewish star, or
                           yin-yang, or a swastika, but this is a

                           could pull it off, not even by

          EXT     ROME      DAY
          
          We soar over Rome, the Eternal City. A helicopter WHOOSHES into
          frame below us.
          
          INT      HELICOPTER         DAY
          
          The papal helicopter is plush inside, and nearly silent. A very
          pricey piece of equipment.    Vincenzo stares out the window.
          
                                           VINCENZO
                            If the llluminati have returned and
                            are in Rome, we will hunt them down
                            and kill them.
          
          Langdon, seated across from him, stifles a laugh.

                            The llluminati didn't become violent
                            anti-Papists until the 17th century.
                            Initially, they were physicists,
                            mathematicians, astronomers.      Their
                            name means "the Enlightened Ones." In
                            the 1500s, they started meeting
                            secretly to share their concerns about
                            the church's inaccurate teachings.
                            They were dedicated to the quest for
                            scientific truth.     And for that, the
                            church -- to use your words -- hunted
                            them down and killed them.      Drove
                            them underground.
          
          Langdon turns and looks out the front window of the helicopter as,
          up ahead, the marble facade of St. Peter's Basilica blazes like
          fire in the afternoon sun.

          Pulling away from the helicopter, we see a coat of arms emblazoned
          on its side -- two skeleton keys crossing a shield and papal crown.
          The helicopter SWOOPS over St. Peter's Square, filled with more
          tourists than usual, due to the impending start of Conclave.
          
          We drift toward a structure on the far side of the Square, closer
          to its huge, ornate windows.    As we approach, large swaths of
          black drop down, draping over the windows, closing off our view.
          
          INT      SISTINE CHAPEL        DAY
          
          Inside, WORKERS continue to drape large bolts of black velvet over
          the windows, sealing this room off from outside.    Pulling back,
          we realize it's not just any room ---
          
          --- it's the Sistine Chapel.   As the last window is blackened,
          the room is bathed in a profound darkness lit only by candles.
          
          ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE MEN in red robes are gathered inside the
          Chapel, the College of Cardinals.    They talk in a polyglot of
          languages, milling about the place, conferring, catching up on old
          friendships.
          
          Cardinal Mortati, the Dean of the College who led the Pope's elegy
          mass, is the type of man one crosses a room to see, not the other
          way around.

          He chats in Italian with two other Cardinals, until a black-
          cassocked aide (FATHER SIMEON) outside the open doors of the
          Chapel catches his eye.    Mortati excuses himself, steps through
          the open doorway, and into ---

                            A very long way for him to say very
                            little.

          On the ground now and behind Vatican walls, Langdon and Vincenzo
          walk briskly around a corner and are met by ERNESTO OLIVETTI, a
          solidly-built man in his late thirties.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           Professor Langdon, welcome to Vatican
                           City.    Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector
                           Generale of the Vatican Police Force.
          
          He takes Langdon by the arm and gestures down a narrow passageway.
          
                                         OLIVETTI (cont'd)
                           This way, please, we'll meet in the
                           headquarters of the Swiss Guard.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           I assumed you were Swiss Guard.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           No. The Gendarmerie is responsible
                           for everything inside the Vatican
                           walls, with the exception of the
                           security of His Holiness and the
                           Apostolic Palace.   That is Swiss
                           Guard.    The Commandante Generale of
                           the Roman Carbinieri has joined us as
                           well, in an advisory capacity, and
                           the Guarda Nacionale have sent a
                           representative.

                           So jurisdictionally, this is-
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           A God damn nightmare.
          
                                       14.
          
          
          
          They turn a corner and approach a squat stone building labeled
          "Offizia della Guarda Suiza."
          
          TWO SWISS GUARDSMEN are standing outside the entrance to the
          building.    They're somewhat comically dressed in puffy tunics
          vertically striped in brilliant blue and gold, with matching
          pantaloons and spats, topped by a black beret.
          
          Langdon can't completely hide a smile.    Olivetti notices.    The
          Guards raise their eight-foot swords, allowing the three of them
          to enter the building.
          
          INT     SWISS GUARD OFFICES - CORRIDOR      DAY
          
          The interior of the Swiss Guard offices is ornate and filled with
          artwork, like every other Vatican building.    As they walk,
          Langdon studies the row of statues of male nudes that lines both
          sides of the hallway, all wearing fig leaves.

                           I beg your pardon?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           1857. Pius IX felt the male form might
                           inspire lust, so he got a hammer and
                           chisel and unmanned two hundred
                           statues.    These plaster fig leaves
                           were added later.
          
          Olivetti stops abruptly, outside a heavy steel door with a
          security keyguard beside it.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           Are you anti-Catholic, Professor
                           Langdon?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Me?   No, I'm anti-vandalism.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           I urge you to guard your tone in there.
                           The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a
                           profession, and it encourages a certain
                           -- zealotry.   Commander Rocher, the
                           head of the Guard, is a deeply
                           spiritual man, and he was close to the
                           late Pope.    Understood?

                           So do I.     You were my idea.
          
          He enters a five-digit number on the keypad and the steel doors
          slide open.
          
          INT     SWISS GUARD HEADQUARTERS          DAY
          
          The headquarters of the Swiss Guard is in a lushly adorned
          Renaissance library crammed with sophisticated communications and
          surveillance equipment.    It's crowded, Swiss Guard (in suits and
          ties, the pantaloons are more for show), uniformed Carbinieri, and
          Vatican Police crammed around different stations, some working
          together, others arguing, mostly in Italian.

          He crosses the room to a tall, fair-haired man around sixty,
          weathered like steel -- maybe "tempered" is the better word.
          
          While they confer, Langdon notices a woman to his left.    We
          recognize Vittoria Vetra, the physicist we saw at CERN.
          
          She catches Langdon's eye, forces a grim smile, recognizes they're
          both strangers here.    Olivetti comes back with COMMANDER ROCHER,
          the tall man, very much in charge.    He speaks with a French/Swiss

                           Ms. Vetra?    I'm Commander Rocher,
                           Commandante Principale of the Swiss
                           Guard.    Thank you for coming.     And
                           Professor Langdon?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           That's right. Rocher looks him up and
                           down, so, you're Langdon.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           Thank God, the symbologist is here.
                           Ms. Vetra, this way, please.
          
          He leads Vittoria across the room, to a surveillance monitor.
          Langdon, puzzled by the cold shoulder, looks at Olivetti, who
          leans in.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           There's been a development.    We
                           received another threat from the
                           kidnapper.
          
                                       16.
          
          
          
          Across the room, they hear Vittoria GASP.   Olivetti goes to join
          them, nodding to Langdon to follow.
          
          AT THE MONITOR,
          
          Langdon and Olivetti join Rocher and Vittoria and stare at the
          image on a video monitor -- it's a familiar-looking canister, in
          which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in the middle, suspended.
          The acronym CERN is stenciled up its side.     On its base is an
          LED display, counting down from about six hours.
          
          At the top of the monitor flashes superimposed text -- LIVE FEED,
          CAMERA #86.

                            around midnight last night.     The
                            intruder killed my research partner,

                           It would be a blinding explosion,
                           equivalent to about five megatons.

          A few moments later, they're crowded around the communications
          console at Rocher's desk, where a dimly-lit video recording is
          playing back on a computer screen.    (The office is behind a
          glass wall to one side of the headquarters.)

                           llluminati scientists and branded
                           their chests with the symbol of the

                           Segno, the sign that marks the start
                           of the Path, I'm willing to bet the
                           four churches along it are where he
                           intends to murder your cardinals. If
                           we can get to one of them before he
                           does, we can stop it.    But to find
                           the start of the path, I need to get
                           into the Archives.

          A spectacular view of St. Peter's Square, through the windows of
          the Papal offices.    Moving down, we find a figure dressed in a
          simple black cassock, his back to us, staring out at the crowd.
          FATHER SEBASTIAN GUTTIEREZ, the Camerlengo, speaks with a soft
          Spanish accent.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           His Holiness once told me that a Pope
                           is a man torn between two worlds...
                           the real world and the divine.
          
          Assembled in the grand office are Langdon, Rocher, Olivetti, and
          Vittoria.    The Camerlengo's back is still turned.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                           He warned that any church that ignored
                           reality would not survive to enjoy the
                           divine.
          
          He turns around.    He's younger than we thought, in his mid-
          thirties, deep, dark eyes.    The kind of priest who often
          inspires, before the years of dogma catch up with him.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                           It seems the real world is upon us
                           tonight.
                                (to Langdon)
                           I'm familiar with llluminati lore, and
                           the legend of the brandings.    La
                           Purga is a dark stain on the church's
                           history; I'm not surprised this ghost
                           has come back to haunt us.

          He sits behind the massive desk, and if he seemed young before, he
          seems like a child now, overcome by the position he's in.    But
          when he speaks to Rocher, he's in command.

                            and the safety of the cardinals is my

                            Good.    Now -- you said the image on
                            screen was illuminated by artificial
                            light.    May I suggest methodically
                            cutting the power to various sections
                            of the City.     When the image on your
                            screen goes dark, you'll have a more
                            specific idea of the device's
                            location.
          
          Rocher looks at Olivetti -- gotta admit, that's a pretty damn good
          idea.

                            Leonardo kept detailed journals; if he

                            doing, he would have made a note of
                            it.

          He pauses, thinking, then turns the phone on his desk to face her.
          While she picks it up to dial, the Camerlengo comes around his
          desk to speak privately to Langdon.

                            Mr. Langdon.    You're correct that I
                            may grant you access to the Archives.

                            that I will.     Christianity's most
                            sacred codices are in that archive.

                            question first.
          
          Langdon looks at him -- fire away.

                            I didn't ask if you believe what man
                            says about God, I asked if you believe
                            in God.

                            I'm an academic. My mind tells me I
                            will never understand God.

                            Tells me I'm not meant to.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him -- that's not quite good enough.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            I believe that faith is a gift, which
                            I have not been fortunate enough to
                            receive.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him for a long moment. Pretty damn good
          answer.    He puts a hand on Langdon's shoulder and leans in.

          They turn down a narrow passageway. A VOICE calls from behind
          them.

                           of life.    That would give us another

                                          LANGDON
                           And a devout Catholic.     He thought
                           science and religion weren't enemies,
                           but two different languages telling
                           the same story.     He wanted like
                           minds to be able to find the Church of
                           Illumination, but he couldn't exactly
                           advertise its location, so he created
                           a coded path.     An unknown llluminati
                           master sculpted four statues, each a
                           tribute to one of the four fundamental
                           elements -- earth, air, fire, water --
                           and put them out in public, in
                           churches throughout Rome.     Each
                           statue held a clue, pointing to the
                           next. And at the end of the trail was
                           the Church of Illumination.
          
                                         26.
          
          
          
          Vicenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the
          hill toward the Archives. They follow, quickly.

                           What makes you think he's going to
                           murder the cardinals in the churches?

                           The llluminati called those four

          Langdon stops in his tracks.

                           Oh.   Oh, wow.
          
          He's staring up at the impressive facade of the Vatican Archives.
          He takes a deep breath, then steps forward to enter.    But
          Vincenzo doesn't follow.    Langdon looks at him.

                           Vatican Police aren't allowed access

                           be here when you're done.
          
          Langdon turns back to the Archives with a look of deep contentment
          -- he's wanted in here for a long, long time.
          
          And steps through the double doors.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          INT     APOSTOLIC PALACE        DAY
          
          The Camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the Apostolic
          Palace, deep in thought.    He reaches the top of the Royal
          Staircase, and can hear the RUMBLING of activity in the Sistine
          Chapel below.
          
          Looking down the stairs, he sees the doorway open, and the
          gathering of cardinals inside.    As he reaches the base of the
          stairs, Cardinal Mortati, who has been summoned, steps outside to
          meet him, flanked by his aide, Father Simeon.
          
                                       27.
          
          
          
          Vincenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the
          hill toward the Archives.    They follow, quickly.
          
          They speak in English, their common language.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO

                           And the other cardinals?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Await your word.
          
          The Camerlengo thinks, feels the weight of this decision on his
          young shoulders.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           May I ask your guidance, Padre?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           My belief is we should proceed with
                           the sealing of conclave.
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                           At this hour?        That would be highly
                           unorthodox.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           And yet within church law.    It's in
                           my power, I've been chosen Great
                           Elector.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO

                           The only ambitions I have are for my
                           church.    St. Peter's church, which
                           is under attack at its most vulnerable
                           moment.    This is not a coincidence.
                           Is it possible our enemies hope to
                           distract us from our sacred task?
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           The church will not fall in a day. We
                           may be wise to consider evacuation.

                                         MORTATI
                           That is exactly what they want,
                           publicity and panic.    We must not
                           give them oxygen for the media fire.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           What of the safety of the cardinals?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Surely there is not an elector present
                           who values his physical being more
                           than the unbroken leadership of the
                           Holy See.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           And the people in St. Peter's Square?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           They care as deeply about their church
                           as we do.    Their faith will sustain
                           them.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           But if their faith does not protect
                           them from an explosion?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           We're all bound for heaven eventually,
                           are we not?
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
                           blessings of a long and full life.
          
          Mortati bristles at the thinly-veiled insult.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Signore, do not confuse the power of
                           the office you temporarily hold with
                           your true place here in the Vatican.
                           You were a favorite of His Holiness,
                           but His Holiness is with his Father
                           now.
          
                                              CAMERLENGO
                           Mea culpa.
          
          Satisfied, Mortati looks back over his shoulder, at the anxious
          faces in the Chapel.    Then turns back to the Camerlengo.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Seal the doors.
          
                                       29.
          
          
          
          With a heavy THUD, the huge doors close and bolts SLAM into place.
          An ancient key GRINDS in an ornate lock, two heavy chains RATTLE
          into place, FOUR SWISS GUARD take position in front of the doors
          and at that very moment --
          
          INT      VATICAN ARCHIVES      DAY
          
          -- two huge, modern glass doors WHOOSH open, revealing what looks
          like a 23rd century library.     It's a massive underground space,
          like a darkened airplane hangar, with a dozen glass boxes evenly
          spaced throughout.     They're lit up from within, each containing
          row upon row of bookshelves, neatly filled with books, papers, and
          arcana.
          
          LT. CHARTRAND, a twenty-five year old member of the Swiss Guard
          (in a suit and earpiece, not the traditional garb), leads Langdon
          and Vittoria toward the glass enclosures.
          
                                          CHARTRAND

                            The chambers are hermetic vaults,
                            oxygen is kept at lowest possible
                            levels.    It's a partial vacuum
                            inside. More than ten minutes in the
                            vault is not recommended without
                            breathing apparatus.
          
          He stops at one particular chamber and gestures to the sign on its
          door -- "Il Processo Galileano."
          
                                          CHARTRAND (cont'd)
                            I'll be just outside the door.
          
          Langdon starts toward the entrance to the vault, but Chartrand
          puts a hand on his chest, stopping him.
          
                                          CHARTRAND (cont'd)
                            Watching you, Mr. Langdon.
          
          Langdon looks at him.    He's not popular around here.
          
          INT      GALILEO VAULT      DAY
          
          The electronic revolving door spins and admits Langdon to the
          interior of the vault. He takes a deep breath, holds it, and lets
          it out.
          
          Vittoria follows shortly behind him, and she's unprepared -- the
          lack of oxygen hits her hard, she dizzies.
          
                                        30.

                           Take a moment.     If you feel double
                           vision, double over.

                           Feels like I'm... scuba diving... with
                           the wrong mixture.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Plenty of time.
          
          He checks his watch.   It's 7:07.

          INT     A DARK SPACE       DAY
          
          In a dark space, a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of
          hot water.    An elegant man in his forties, dressed in a casual
          suit, no tie, HUMS softly to himself as he steeps his tea.    No
          idea of his name, but his suit is gray, so how about MR. GRAY.
          
          The tea is on an old wooden table, being heated by a small can of
          sterno.    While Mr. Gray bobs the tea bag, he stares at something
          to his right.
          
          Money.    A lot of it, in a number of different denominations,
          neatly segmented in a briefcase.    And three passports, all
          different colors (and nationalities), neatly placed on top of it.
          
          Satisfied, Mr. Gray CLICKS the briefcase shut and slides it under
          the table, tucking it up against the wall.    He removes the cup
          from the heat, still bobbing the tea bag.
          
          He walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange
          walls.    He heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of
          stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the
          older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped
          cardinals.
          
          He stops at the last cell, where the man, CARDINAL LAMASSE, looks
          up at him from the wooden bench he's sitting on.
          
                                         MR. GRAY
                           You have no idea what you're missing.

                            I was referring to my tea.    Last
                            chance, I'd be happy to make you a
                            cup.

                            done.

                            -- but with what I'm about to do.
          
          
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          Mr. Gray's hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses it into
          a fireplace, where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry
          kindling.    He picks up something else and places it in the heart
          of the flames.
          
          A long-handled iron rod.

          Inside the archive, Vittoria is searching the lower shelves while

                            it for almost ten years.     Ever since

                            The number 503.    I kept seeing it over
                            and over in llluminati letters, scribbled
                            in the margins, or sometimes just signed
                            that way, "503."      It's a numerical
                            clue, but to what?     Five, of course, is
                            the sacred llluminati number -- the
                            pentagram, Pythagoras, a dozen other
                            examples in science -- but why three?

                            Galileo laid out his theories about
                            the earth revolving around the sun,
                            and the church forced him to recant.

                            to write.    Smuggled out of Rome and
                            printed in Holland on sedge papyrus.
                            That way any scientists caught with a
                            copy could simply drop it in water and
                            the booklet would dissolve.

          the deep crevice of the margin as the page moves, Langdon grabs a

          Two black Alfa-Romeos with   tinted windows glide to a stop on

          Commander Rocher and THREE   MORE SWISS GUARD, all in black suits,

          INT     PANTHEON       DAY
          
          -- the Pantheon, a massive, circular room with a 141-foot
          unsupported span even larger than the cupola of St. Peter's. There
          are a DOZEN TOURISTS scattered around, and a TOUR GROUP on one
          side hearing a lecture from a MUSEUM DOCENT.
          
          Langdon looks up at the hole in the ceiling through which a bright
          shaft of light is shining.

          Looking around, Vittoria sees several sarcophagi scattered around
          the room, all pointing obliquely in a certain direction. As they
          move stealthily through the crowd, they speak in low tones:

          shadowy recesses behind the pillars at the edges of the room.
          
          Langdon walks slowly, checking out faces.       Tourists.   Couples.

          He looks at his watch.    Five minutes to eight.       And then --
          
          --- a SHRIEK from the other side of the room.      He whirls, sees
          Vittoria backing away from something.

          His eyes flit around the room, from one ornate sarcophagus to
          another.    And then it hits him:

          At the front door of the church,
          
          Langdon hops over the sawhorses blocking the entrance and tries
          the door.    Locked.    A sign says the place is under
          construction.
          
          At a side door,
          
          Olivetti races alongside the church, followed by the others.
          He reaches a door with a large, heavy ring, and pulls it toward
          him. But the door won t budge.    He pushes, throws his shoulder
          into it.    Locked.
          
                                          LANGDON
                                 (APPROACHING)
                            No, no, it's an annulus!
          
          But Olivetti just races onward, looking for another door, followed
          by Vincenzo.    As they disappear around the back of the church,
          Langdon steps up to the large ring, gives it an almighty twist --
          
          INT       SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO            DUSK
          
          -- and the heavy door CLUNKS open.
          
          The interior of the church is an obstacle course of torn-up
          flooring, brick pallets, mounds of dirt.    Silt drifts in the
          dying sunlight that shines through the broken windows and walls.
          
          Nothing moves.    Dead silence.    Langdon and Vittoria walk
          slowly to the middle of the floor, at one end of the chapel.
          There are eight recesses, four on either side of a central aisle,
          all covered with large sheets of plastic, to protect them during
          construction.
          
                                         46.
          
          
          
                                          LANGDON
                                 (WHISPERING)
                            The chapel is in one of those apses.
          
          The plastic RUSTLES ominously.       Anything could be behind any one
          of them.
          
          Vittoria pulls the gun from her waistband and holds it in front of
          her.    Langdon notices, it makes him uncomfortable.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            You have to give that back.
          
          She looks at him --- what are you, nuts? Something rushes at them
          from the side, she whirls --
          
          --- and nearly blows Olivetti to kingdom come as he and Vincenzo
          barrel in through the side door.
          
          Langdon gestures --- everybody quiet. Olivetti points to the left
          gestures to Langdon and Vittoria to go to the right.
          
          They separate, to either side of the main aisle.
          
          AT THE FIRST CHAPEL,
          
          Langdon pulls the plastic aside, eyes scan the chapel.      Nothing.
          ON THE OTHER SIDE,
          
          Olivetti does the same, at another chapel.      Nothing.
          
          AT THE THIRD CHAPEL,
          
          Vittoria pushes the plastic aside, gun in front of her.      There's
          a sudden movement to her left, she whirls --
          
          --- and a rat scurries away.
          
          AT THE FOURTH CHAPEL,
          
          Langdon pushes the plastic aside, steps inside --
          
          -- and GASPS.
          
          Moving behind him, we see a Christian chapel like no other we've
          ever seen.    Finished entirely in chestnut marble, overhead it
          has a domed cupola with a field of illuminated stars and the seven
          planets (as known in Galileo's day).
          
          Further down the wall, there are tributes to earth's four seasons
          but most incredible of all are the two huge structures that
          dominate the room from either side.
          
                                          47.
          
          
          
          Pyramids.    Ten feet high.
          
          Vittoria steps in behind him.
          
                                            LANGDON
                            Pyramids.      In a Catholic church.
                            This is it.
          
          Behind them, the plastic rustles, as if drawn by a wind, and as
          Langdon turns, he hears, faintly, a DOOR CLOSING far away.
          
          He turns back, eyes drawn to the floor.    There is a large oval
          medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it.    It's slightly
          off center, raised.    As if it's been opened recently, and
          hurriedly replaced.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            The demon's hole.
          
          IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,
          
          we're looking up now as the medallion GRINDS to the side.     Faces
          peer down at us -- Langdon, Vittoria, Olivetti, and Vincenzo. They
          recoil from a stench.
          
          UP TOP,
          
          Langdon squints, trying to see inside.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Anybody got a flashlight?
          
          Vincenzo hands him one.    Langdon shines it down into the crypt.
          There are shapes, but thirty feet down and hard to make out.
          
          There's one in particular, in the darkness, seems too short to be
          a person, but it's moving slightly.
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            Can you tell what it is?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Not from up here.
          
          He reaches down, rattles the ladder that leans against the wall of
          the crypt.    Takes a deep breath, looks at the others.
          
                                                LANGDON (cont'd)
                            Those guns.          Keep 'em handy?
          
                                       48.
          
          
          
          IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,
          
          Langdon reaches the bottom, still shining the light at the figure
          in the distance.    It's brighter here, he can see it's flesh-
          colored, but still indistinct.    He takes a step toward it --
          
          -- and something CRUNCHES under his feet.
          
          He shines the light down.    He's standing on a pile of human skulls
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                                 (calling down)
                            You okay?
          
                                             LANGDON
                            More or less.
          
          He takes two more steps, closer to the swaying figure on the other
          side of the crypt.    He can now clearly see a man's naked back.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            He's here!    I think he's -- sitting.
                                 (moves closer)
                            Hello?
                                 (closer still)
                            Are you all right?
          
          It's a human figure.     As Langdon draws close, he sees the source
          of the movement --- rats, gnawing at the dead body.
          
          They scurry away as Langdon comes around the front, and we pull
          back to see what he sees.
          
          It's Cardinal Lamasse.
          
          He's been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist
          his jaw broken, his mouth crammed full of dirt.
          
          But that's not the worst of it.    Langdon GAGS as he sees the
          blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the
          Cardinal's chest.    It's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but
          this time it says --
          
                                         EARTH.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL      DAY
          
          Cardinal Mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front of
          the Sistine Chapel as the electors, one by one, cast their votes
          in the traditional manner.
          
                                        49.
          
          
          
          An AFRICAN CARDINAL at the front of the line kneels before him.
          
                                          AFRICAN CARDINAL
                                 (SUBTITLED)
                            I call as my witness Christ the Lord,
                            who will be my judge that my vote is
                            given to the one who before God I
                            think should be elected.
          
          The African Cardinal stands, holds his ballot over his head, t
          lowers the ballot to the altar, where a plate sits atop a large
          chalice.
          
          He places the ballot on the plate, then picks up the plate and
          uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice.    He then replaces the
          plate over the chalice, bows to the cross, and heads for his seat.
          
          The next cardinal steps up to repeat the process.
          
          A SHORT TIME LATER, A DISSOLVE,
          
          and the line is gone.    Mortati holds the chalice with all the
          votes.    He shakes it, chooses one---
          
                                          MORTATI
                            Eligo in summum pontificem --
          
          -- and reads an unfamiliar name.
          
          He makes a note in a ledger, then raises a threaded needle and
          pierces the ballot through the word "Eligo," sliding the ballot on
          the thread.
          
          A SHORT TIME LATER,   ANOTHER DISSOLVE,
          
          and there are a hundred and sixty-one ballots on the thread,
          Mortati looks up from his ledger and speaks to the room.
          
                                          MORTATI
                            The first ballot has failed.
          
          He takes He thread carrying all the ballots and ties the ends
          together to create a ring.
          
          He lays the ring of ballots on a silver tray.     Dusts the tray
          heavily with a yellowish powder.
          
          A DOOR OPENS
          
          on a small incinerator. The ring of ballots is hurled inside and
          bursts immediately into flame.
          
                                         50.
          
          
          
          A dark, brackish smoke billows up from the burning ballots, and we
          follow the smoke up, up, into the chimney --
          
          EXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE         DUSK
          
          --- and to the roof of the Sistine Chapel, where the black iUPke
          puffs out into the early evening sky.
          
          Below, a CROWD OF THOUSANDS GROANS in disappointment as the
          message is sent --- no new pope yet.
          
          But while they are all watching the smoke, we turn our attention?
          to the opposite direction, to the east, across Rome, to where ---
          
                                                                        CUT TO:
          
          EXT     PIAZZA DEL POPOLO        DUSK
          
          --- those black Alfa Romeos, four this time, glide silently to a
          halt outside the church where Langdon just found the corpse. Swiss
          Guard in black suits pour out of the vehicles and hurry into the
          church, trying to attract as little attention as possible.
          
          INT     SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO          DUSK
          
          The inside of the church is being sealed off as a crime scene.
          Rocher, just arriving, takes charge as the plastic is RIPPED off
          the Chigi Chapel.
          
                                          ROCHER
                            Get that body out of there and search
                            the rest of the building.
          
          Swiss Guardsmen drop into the demon's hole to remove the body.
          
                                           ROCHER (cont'd)
                                 (to another Guardsman)
                            Outside -- a perimeter.    Secure but
                            invisible.     No lights, no guns, no
                            one knows.     Understood?
          
          Langdon, lost in thought, drifts through the small chapel, studying
          the intricate carvings and other artwork.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Earthly symbology... everywhere...
          
          Rocher passes through his field of vision, livid:
          
                                          ROCHER
                            Why the hell didn't you figure this
                            out in the first place?
          
                                       51.
          
          
          
          It was more a rhetorical question, but Langdon answers honestly,
          still lost in thought, his voice soft.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           I made a mistake.
          
          He drifts toward a statue, of the highest quality white marble,
          resting in a niche on the far side, out of the way of the mayhem.
          
          Vittoria joins him.
          
                                             VITTORIA
                           Is it Raphael?
          
                                          LANGDON
                           The chapel is.     But the sculptures
                           are Bernini.
                                (STUNNED)
                           The unknown Illuminati master was
                           Bernini.
          
                                         VITTORIA
                           Didn't he work for the Church?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Almost exclusively.    It means the
                           Illuminati even infiltrated the
                           Vatican.    They hid in plain sight.
          
          He steps closer to the statue.    It's of two life-size human
          figures, intertwined, one a regal, bearded man, the other a
          cherub, floating overhead.

                           The prophet who predicted the
                           annihilation of the earth.    This is
                           the first marker.
          
          He steps closer, studying it carefully.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)

                           quest..."
          
          His eyes move slowly over the statue, and ours do too, from the
          angel's innocent face, down his arm, and to his right hand, which
          is outstretched, one finger extended --
          
                                       52.

          Langdon dashes down the stairs outside the church and into the
          middle of the piazza.    It's getting dark now, shadows streaking
          the square.
          
                                           LANGDON
                            Southwest...   it points southwest...
          
          He gets his bearings, looks to the southwest, sees nothing but
          buildings in the way.
          
          He runs back up the church steps, where Vittoria and Rocher are
          just coming outside.    Langdon's mind is racing.
          
                                           LANGDON (cont'd)
                            Earth-air-fire-water, we're looking
                            for a Bernini sculpture having
                            something to do with air...

                            And the next church is southwest of
                            here.
          
                                          ROCHER
                            You're sure this time?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            I need a map.    One that shows all
                            the churches in Rome.
          
          Rocher just stares at him, studying him.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            I could use it now.
          
          Rocher starts down the steps toward his car.
          
                                             LANGDON (cont'd)
                            And a compass!
          
          He looks around, sees the rickety scaffolding outside the church,
          and ---
          
                                           53.
          
          
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          --- he climbs into our view, now on the scaffolding.       He's moving
          upward, fast, toward ---
          
          EXT     CHURCH ROOF       DUSK
          
          --- the roof of the old church, also undergoing renovation. The
          view of Rome is spectacular from up here, and Langdon rushes to
          the western wall, looking intently off in that direction.
          
          He sees something that makes him suck in his breath, hears a voice
          from behind him ---
          
                                                 VITTORIA   (O.S.)
                             Robert!
          
          --- and turns as Vittoria tosses something small and black up to
          him.
          
          A compass.    He catches it, holds it steady, and walks toward the
          edge of the roof as the compass needle swivels and settles on SW.
          
          Langdon looks up, following the line of the needle, up over the
          rooftops of Rome, to a massive structure in the distance, exactly
          in line with the compass needle.
          
          A huge dome on the horizon blots out the setting sun.
          
          ST.   PETER'S BASILICA.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON a map of Rome, unfolded in the back seat of a racing car
          and spread out over Langdon and Vittoria's laps.    Langdon has a
          pen and is drawing a line on the map, through --
          
                                           LANGDON
                             The black rectangles with crosses are
                             churches, and none of them intersect
                             the line until it comes to an end,
                             right in the middle of St. Peter's
                             Square.
          
          Night has fallen, and the four Alfa Romeos are now speeding across
          Rome.    No sirens, but lots of speed.    Olivetti drives, Rocher
          is in the passenger seat.
          
                                         54.

                             The Basilica is Michelangelo, but the
                             square is Bernini.    The second
                             marker must be a statue in the square.

                                           ROCHER
                             Not unless we want the full attention
                             of the world press.
          
          She looks down, to two television screens mounted into the backs
          of the front seats.    Both are tuned to coverage of the papal
          selection process, REPORTERS doing stand-ups from the middle of
          crowded St. Peter's Square.
          
          We move in on one of the images, then into the image, coming out -
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          EXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE     NIGHT
          
          --- on a television monitor in St. Peter's Square. The Reporter, a
          JAPANESE WOMAN, is giving a stand-up report on the progress so
          far, gesturing to the chimney over the Sistine Chapel.
          
          The crowd has grown, now four thousand, maybe five. FLASHBULBS
          POP.    A few PROTESTERS CHANT.
          
          Almost silently, behind them all, half a dozen black Alfa Romeos
          race in, too fast, and come to an abrupt halt.
          
          IN ROCHER'S CAR,
          
          they all get out, trying to avoid causing a panic.
          
          Langdon walks into the square, eyes focused on an object in the
          middle.
          
                                           LANGDON
                             Another obelisk.    We're close.
          
          He looks up, at row after row of statues that ring the square from
          atop the oval colonnades.
          
          SHARPSHOOTERS scurry among the statuary, setting themselves up.
          
                                         55.
          
          
          
          In the crowd, Rocher MUTTERS into his radio and to undercover
          SWISS GUARD scattered throughout.    The crowd is unaware of them.
          
          Langdon keeps walking, turning in circles, looking above him, to
          the tops of the colonnades that border the square.
          
                                         VITTORIA
                           There must be a hundred statues up
                           there, which one is it?
          
                                         LANGDON
                           How in God's name would anyone make a
                           sculpture about air?
          
          And indeed there are.    Langdon looks at his watch.      Two
          minutes to nine.
          
          And then he freezes.    Staring down, not up.
          
          He takes a step back. There is a fresco carved into the square
          beneath his feet, or more accurately --
          
                                               LANGDON (cont'd)
                           Bas relief!
          
          He takes a step back, to look at the carving, as does Vittoria.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                           The other half of sculpture is bas
                           relief.
                                (to Vittoria)
                           Look for more!     Something having to
                           do with air!
          
          They move through the crowd, pushing people aside, causing a bit
          of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in the
          stone of the square.
          
          (IF WE ARE EAGLE-EYED, at this point we will see TWO ROBED MEN,
          one helping the other, who carries a cross, as they pass through
          the crowd behind Langdon.)
          
          Remembering something, Langdon rushes forward, toward the center
          of the square, uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd,
          shoving his way through now.
          
          He draws close to one carving in particular, slows to a stop, and
          stares down at it, eyes wide.
          
          It's a carving of an angel's face, cheeks billowing outward as it
          blows a gust of wind, symbolized by five vertical streaks.    Its
          title is ---
          
                                         56.
          
          
          
                                            LANGDON (cont'd)
                              "West Ponente."    The West Wind.    An
                              angel's face and five streaks.   Air!
          
          So this is it, but now what?    They look around frantically,
          scanning the crowd.    So does Rocher, so does Olivetti.    The
          BELLS of St. Peter's start to TOLL the hour.
          
          NEARBY,
          
          a LITTLE GIRL dances with a doll.      Happily unaware of what's
          going on.
          
          ELSEWHERE,
          
          some PROTESTERS tangle.      Some believe one thing, others don't.
          
          Swiss Guard and Vatican Police race in to break it up. But there's
          no bloodshed.
          
          CLOSE TO THAT,
          
          a ROBED MAN carrying a small wooden cross falls to the ground.
          Somebody near him SCREAMS.
          
          NEARBY,
          
          the Little Girl is jostled by a HOMELESS MAN, drops her doll.
          
          THE ROBED MAN
          
          is helped to his feet by the Police.      He's fine.   He wanders
          away, holding his cross high.
          
          And as he passes us, we catch just a glimpse of his face ---
          
          --and recognize Mr. Gray.
          
          THE LITTLE GIRL
          
          bends down, picks up her doll, and sees --
          
          -- IT'S COVERED IN BLOOD.
          
          She looks down at the ground, sees a trail of blood, follows it
          with her eyes to where ---
          
          -- the Homeless Man, dressed in torn rags, leans against a
          fountain, gasping for breath.
          
          ACROSS THE CROWD,
          
                                        57.
          
          
          
          Vittoria and Langdon hear the SCREAMS.    They're closest, and
          they're at the fountain in just a few seconds.
          
          Langdon drops to his knees, turns the Homeless Man over.
          Through the man's torn shirt, he can see a black and red brand
          burned into his chest.
          
          Three letters, ornate script, reading the same front to back:
          
                                          AIR.
          
          Vittoria grabs his arm,   feels for a pulse.
          
                                           VITTORIA
                             He's still alive!
          
          But the dying Cardinal is gasping for breath, his mouth opening
          and closing like a fish on a dock.
          
          She bends down, arches his neck, closes her mouth over his, and
          blows air into his lungs.
          
          Immediately, a fog of red mist BILLOWS from two puncture holes in
          the man's chest, covering Langdon in blood --- his face, his
          clothes.
          
                                           VITTORIA (cont'd)
                             His chest! They punctured his lungs!
          
          Langdon recoils in horror, overcome, completely out of his depth.
          
          Rocher arrives, as does Olivetti, as do a DOZEN MORE SWISS GUARD
          and VATICAN POLICE.    Rocher looks around, defeated and enraged,
          as the Cardinal expires and the Crowd panics, fleeing in all

          Blood and water swirl down a drain. Langdon looks up from the
          sink, water rushing from his face. He dries himself, looks in the
          mirror.    He holds up his hands. They're shaking.
          
          He's standing in a lavish marble bathroom, now cleaned up and
          changed into black pants and a black long-sleeved shirt.    No
          Roman collar, they don't just give you those, but clearly the
          clothes of a priest.    He steps out of the bathroom and into ---

          INT     PAPAL OFFICE     NIGHT
          
          -- the papal office, where the Camerlengo, Rocher, Olivetti, and
          Vittoria are gathered again, as are HALF A DOZEN other security
          officers.     It's crowded, busy, little knots of jurisdictional
          arguments and competing theories around the room.
          
          The Camerlengo, at his desk, is stunned, speaking to Olivetti.
          Langdon edges close enough to hear, but not too close.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            When did this call come in?
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            Three, four minutes ago.    The same
                            voice as on the tape.    We're
                            analyzing the accent now, Alsatian is
                            our best guess at the moment.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            And he actually claimed responsibility
                            for the death of His Holiness?
          
                                          OLIVETTI
                            Not personally, but he said it was the
                            Illuminati.    He said they murdered
                            him.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            That's ridiculous, the Holy Father
                            died of a stroke.    Did he say how
                            they claim to have done it?

                            The Pope's own medication.     A drug
                            known as Heparin?
          
          There is silence for a moment.      Rocher looks up.    Looks away.

                            He had thrombophlebitis.    He took an
                            injection once a day.    But no one
                            knew that.

                           His Holiness had health concerns; he
                           was subject to seizures as well. But
                           he took steps to make sure he was --
                           watched.    For safety.    That's all
                           he wished to be made public, and
                           that's all we should discuss.

                           Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage.
                           An overdose would cause massive
                           internal bleeding and brain
                           hemorrhages.    At first it might look
                           like a stroke, but in a few days his
                           body would show signs, we could easily-

                           public announcement refuting this
                           absurd claim.
          
          Father Simeon, Cardinal Mortati's aide, steps forward.

                           I'm afraid that's out of the question.
                           Cardinal Mortati has insisted this
                           entire matter be kept internal.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Cardinal Mortati shouldn't even be
                           aware of this, he's locked in
                           conclave.

                           His final instructions before sealing
                           the doors were very clear -- no outside
                           communications unless absolutely
                           necessary.

                           Cardinal Mortati will remember that he
                           is Dean of the College of Cardinals,
                           not His Holiness himself.

                           As you say. Yet, technically, now that
                           Conclave has begun, it is his
                           privilege and duty to control public
                           announcements. I've drafted a short
                           release about the incident in the
                           square, but any other statements are
                           specifically prohibited. For that, the
                           Cardinal has asked me to remind you --
                           we have a chimney.
          
          The Camerlengo just stares at him, a power struggle. Which he is
          going to lose.

                           if belatedly, about the Path. It's now
                           nine fifteen, how quickly can you find
                           the next church?
          
          Langdon refers to a map spread out on the desk.

                           The line of the breath in the carving
                           points due east, directly away from
                           Vatican City, but there are five
                           lines, so there's room for error.
          
          While he talks, an AIDE in a business suit is ushered quietly in
          the door by a Swiss Guardsman.    He's carrying a satchel.
          Vittoria recognizes him, and he goes to her.

                           There are about twenty churches that
                           intersect it.    None of their names
                           invoke "fire," but there must be a
                           Bernini sculpture inside one of them
                           that does.    I'm going to need to get
                           back into the Archives to find it.

          Langdon looks to Vittoria -- you coming? She looks up from a table,
          where she's opened the satchel brought in by the Aide. She holds
          two leather-bound books in her hand.

          The group starts to break up, half of them headed for the doors.
          As Langdon rolls up the map on the desk, the Camerlengo notices
          his black clothes for the first time.

          Langdon manages a sliver of a smile, starting to like this guy.

          And almost as one, the row of TV cameras all swing away from the
          crime scene in the square and up, to the Sistine Chapel chimney,
          where there is indeed a thick cloud --
          
          --- of black smoke.    Still no new pope, and the subject is
          effectively changed.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:
          
          INT     VATICAN ARCHIVES      NIGHT
          
          Langdon and Lt. Chartrand, the young Swiss Guardsman, walk quickly
          down the row of hermetically sealed vaults in the Vatican
          Archives.
          
          Langdon's leading, looking at the names on the outsides of each of
          the individual vaults.
          
                                       63.
          
          
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            What are you looking for this time?
          
                                             LANGDON
                            Assets.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            I beg your pardon?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Artwork is valuable, and corporations
                            tend to keep track of their holdings.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            The Catholic Church is not a
                            corporation, Signore, it is a beacon,
                            a source of inspiration for one
                            billion lost and frightened souls.
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Sure sure, I get that.
          
          He stops, pointing up at a sign on the end of one of the vaults --
          BANCO VATICANO.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            But it's also a bank.
          
          He takes one last breath of oxygen-rich air, pushes through the
          revolving door --
          
          INT     VAULT     NIGHT
          
          --- and comes through the other side, eyes scanning the place.    A
          moment later, Chartrand follows him through the door.     Langdon
          looks at him --- you're coming in too?
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            Cfmmander Olivetti said I was not to
                            leave your side this time.

                            Wasn't me, it was her,
          
          MOVING FAST ALONG THE LEATHER-BOUND VOLUMES, Langdon searches the
          place as fast as he can.
          
          BAM!
          
          A book drops onto a table, pages flip by, Langdon studies it,
          SLAMS it shut.
          
                                          64.
          
          
          
          BAM! BAM! Two more books, flipped open, compared, pages rifled,
          nothing.
          
          BACK IN THE STACKS,
          
          his hand finds a five-inch thick ledger marked "Bernini."
          
          ON A TABLE,
          
          it SMACKS down and opens to the first page. Langdon sits, begins
          turning the pages, one by one.
          
          LOOKING AT THE PAGE,
          
          his vision momentarily blurs.         He rubs his eyes, it clears
          again.
          
          He looks up, at a vent over the doorway. Thin ribbons flutter in
          the breeze of the minimal oxygen that's being pumped in.
          
          He goes back to work.   Chartrand watches him.
          
                                                                          CUT TO:
          
          INT     PAPAL OFFICE     NIGHT
          
          Looking out the window of the papal office, we see the barricades
          removed from the edges of St. Peter's Square.    The crowds
          return.
          
          Pulling back, we see the Camerlengo looking out at them, thinking,
          troubled.    There are still half a dozen Security Officials in
          the papal office, but the Camerlengo turns and looks at Vittoria,
          working alone at a desk on the far side of the office.
          
          AT THE DESK,
          
          Vittoria pores over the journals sent from Geneva.    Sensing
          something, she looks up.    The Camerlengo is standing over her.
          He speaks quietly.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           What sort of signs?

                           I'm sorry?
          
          The Camerlengo looks over his shoulder, to make sure their
          conversation is private.

                            congeals and turns the inside of the

                                          CAMERLENGO
                            Even though he died fourteen days ago?

                            week after his death.
          
          He looks around the room once more.          Then back to her?
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            He was... very important to me.

                            I understand.
          
          He thinks for a long moment, then --
          
                                                 CAMERLENGO
                            Please come.
          
          --- turns and leaves the room.         She makes sure no one's looking,
          then follows him out.
          
          She leaves the journals behind.
          
                                                                           CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON the Bernini ledger, which Langdon is now almost halfway
          through.    He tiyrns a page, scans the list of items written
          there, then moves on to the next.
          
          He blinks, his vision blurring again. He looks over at Chartrand,
          who's suffering even worse, panting for air, hands on his knees.
          
                                          LANGDON

                            A little bit.

          Chartrand half-stumbles into a chair on the opposite side of the
          table.    Langdon goes back to what he was doing, flipping a page--
          
          --- and then immediately flipping it back.
          
          There is a hand-written notation alongside one of the entries.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            My Italian's no good, what does this
                            note say?   Next to the entry for The
                            Ecstasy of St. Teresa?
          
          Chartrand leans over the ledger, squinting hard, trying to focus.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            "Moved at suggestion of the artist."

          Chartrand, really suffering for air, can't follow it.
          
                                             CHARTRAND
                            I don't know.
          
          Langdon flips the page back, to a photograph of the sculpture in
          question.
          
          THE STATUE
          
          is of a woman, seemingly in the throes of ecstasy, while an angel
          hovering over her holds a spear aloft.
          
          Langdon raises an eyebrow.
          
          The word "Seraphim" jumps up from the page, words in quotes after
          it -- "Seraphim, meaning 'the fiery one...'"
          
                                             LANGDON
                            Fire.
          
          More words pop out at us -- "His great golden spear... filled with
          fire..."
          
                                             LANGDON (cont'd)
                            Fire.
          
          Still more -- "woman inflamed by passion's fire..."
          
          And now a close-up of her enraptured face.
          
                                           67.

                            Fire.
          
          And now three things happen in quick succession:
          
          -- Langdon SLAMS the ledger shut,
          
          -- the ribbons on the air vent fall as the oxygen into the vault is
          cut off, and
          
          -- one by one, ALL THE LIGHTS IN THE ARCHIVES GO OUT.
          
          Total silence for a moment.
          
          Langdon and Chartrand look at each other in the darkness.

          The Camerlengo, flanked by two Swiss Guardsmen, escorts Vittoria
          rapidly across the deserted floor of St. Peter's Basilica.

          They circle past a pillar and she sees an orange glow up ahead,
          seeming to emanate from beneath the floor in the center of the
          basilica.

                            I was orphaned when I was nine years
                            old.    A bombing in Madrid -- Basque

                            Catholic archbishop.
          
          As they draw closer, she sees it's the entrance to a sumptuous
          underground chamber, surrounded by scores of glowing oil lamps.

                              The archbishop felt responsible, and

                              was raised by him, and by the church.
          
          The Camerlengo starts down a winding stairway, rimmed by the
          lamps,
          
          ON THE STAIRCASE,
          
          they descend, lit by the spectral glow of the oil lamps.

                              to be ordained, but I also refused to
                              be excused from military service.
                              So he suggested I fly rescue missions,
                              helicopters bringing the wounded to
                              hospital.
          
          He stops at the bottom of the stairs and looks up at her.
          
                                            CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                              He was a great man.

                              He died?
          
                                            CAMERLENGO
                                   (NODS)
                              Fourteen days ago.
          
          Vittoria, stunned, realizes who he's talking about.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          INT     VATICAN ARCHIVES       NIGHT
          
          KA-CHUNG! Emergency lights switch on in the Vatican Archives,
          casting a weird, reddish glow over everything.
          
          But the ribbons at the oxygen panel remain limp.
          
          Below, Langdon pushes, again and again, on the deadened exit
          button, trying to activate the doors.    Nothing doing.
          
          He's weak, weaving, barely on his feet.
          
          Chartrand's already slumped against a wall, his radio in hand,
          keying it over and over again, but getting only static.
          
                                         69.
          
          
          
                                               LANGDON
                            Anything?
          
          Chartrand gestures weakly around the room.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            Walls... lead-lined... no signal.
          
          Langdon blinks, his vision becoming seriously impaired. He holds
          his eyes closed for a moment, opens them, it's not much better.
          
          Langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. Then
          at the row of bookcases.    Gets an idea.
          
          He goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the
          glass wall. He hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase
          opposite it, wedges himself in.
          
          And pushes with one leg.      The giant bookcase teeters, but just
          barely.
          
          Langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the
          bookshelf.
          
          Pushes again -- more movement this time.
          
          Now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell.    The
          bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return,
          starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall,
          which it SLAMS into with enormous power and --
          
          --- stops.
          
          Leaning against the wall.     Forget cracks, there's not even a
          scratch.
          
          Langdon CURSES under his breath, looks around for another idea.
          
          He hears a soft THUD from the other side of the room, sees
          Chartrand has slumped over, unconscious.
          
          But his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries
          in a shoulder holster.
          
          LANGDON'S HAND
          
          slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it.     Safe bet he's
          never held one of these before.
          
          He staggers over toward the glass wall, raises the gun, and pulls
          the trigger.    Nothing happens.    Trigger doesn't even move.
          
                                       70.
          
          
          
          After a moment of oxygen-poor thinking, he figures out how to
          CLICK off the safety.    Tries again.
          
          (Pow.)
          
          The sound of the shot is barely audible to Langdon.     His brain's
          going fast.
          
          If he was hoping to bring the whole wall down, he failed, but
          there's a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole, and he
          goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside.
          
          He stands back, his brain clearing momentarily.
          
          Seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners,
          and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just
          made in the center.
          
          He raises the gun again and fires off FOUR SHOTS in quick
          succession.    They're in an odd pattern-- upper left corner, upper
          right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower
          right corner.
          
          Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first
          hole, in the center.
          
          Shaking his head once more to clear it, Langdon steps forward to
          the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a
          chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first
          hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall ---
          
           -- and presses gently.
          
          Almost immediately, a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole beneath his
          hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up
          to connect with the hole in the upper left corner.
          
          He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts,
          shooting down to the lower right.    Then a third, and a fourth,
          the glass is cracking like ice in springtime, all four extremities
          connecting with the central hole, and with a huge GROANING SOUND -
          -
          
          -- the entire glass wall falls to pieces at his feet.
          
          Air RUSHES into the vault.
          
          And, wouldn't you know it, the power comes back on in the Archives.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
                                       71.
          
          
          
          INT     VATICAN GROTTOES      NIGHT
          
          Vittoria, the Camerlengo, and the two Swiss Guard reach the
          entrance to the Holy Vatican Grottoes just as --
          
          -- their power goes out.
          
          Two flashlights CLICK on, and the Guardsmen lead the way in.   On
          both sides, hollow niches line the walls.    Recessed in the
          alcoves, as far as the flashlights let them see, the hulking
          shadows of sarcophagi loom.
          
          On top of each tomb are life-sized marble carvings of each Pope,
          shown in death and wearing full papal vestments, arms folded
          across their chests.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           If the Holy Father was murdered, the
                           implications are profound.    Vatican
                           security is impenetrable, no one from
                           the outside could have gotten anywhere
                           near him.
          
                                         VITTORIA
                           Meaning it was someone on the inside.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           We can trust no one
          
          He steps up his pace, taking the lead, knows exactly where he's
          going.    The others fall behind, as everyone slowly realizes what
          he intends to do.    And they're not at all sure they're up for
          it.
          
          AT THE LATE POPE'S SARCOPHAGUS,
          
          the Camerlengo closes the last few feet alone. He knees down in
          front of the bright marble carving, a likeness of the late Pope.
          He WHISPERS.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Father... Holy Father... You told me
                           when I was young that the voice in my
                           heart was that of God.    You told me
                           I must follow it no matter what
                           painful places it leads.    I hear it
                           now, asking me the impossible.    Give
                           me strength.    Forgive me.    What I
                           do, I do in the name of everything you
                           believe.
          
          BEHIND HIM,
          
                                         72.
          
          
          
          the others watch as he finishes his private prayer, stands, and
          turns to them.
          
                                            CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                              Remove the covering.
          
          Nobody moves.      Just stares at him.
          
                                            CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                              Did you hear me?
          
                                            SWISS GUARDSMAN
                              Signore, by law we are at your
                              command.    But we are also bound by-
          
                                            CAMERLENGO
                              I ask your forgiveness for putting you
                              in this position.    Vatican laws are
                              established to protect the church. But
                              it is in that very spirit that I
                              command you to break them now.
          
          A moment of silence, and then --
          
          -- they step forward.    Set their flashlights on the floor.
          And step to the tomb.    Bracing their hands against the marble
          covering near the head of the tomb, they plant their feet and
          push.
          
          It doesn't move.
          
          They push harder.
          
          Vittoria and the Camerlengo join them.
          
          With an almost primal GROWL of stone on stone, the lid slides,
          rotating off the top of the casket and coming to rest at an angle.
          
          The Camerlengo picks up a flashlight and shines it in the crypt.
          
          Vittoria leans forward.
          
          The light creeps up the Pope's body, over his burial vestments,
          past his folded hands, and finally to his face.
          
          His cheeks have collapsed, the Pope's mouth gapes wide      --
          
          -- and his tongue is black as death.
          
                                                                           CUT TO:
          
                                       73.
          
          
          
          EXT     VATICAN ARCHIVES      NIGHT
          
          The face of Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch is smeared with blood
          from a cut on his hand, but we can still read the time.
          
          It's 9:41.
          
          Langdon and Chartrand stagger down the front steps of the Vatican
          Archives, where they're immediately met by three Vatican Police
          cars.    Olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of
          the steps, holding his hands up in defense almost before Langdon
          can lay into him.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Are you out of your minds?!
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           Please.    In the car.

                           Do you know where the next church is?
          
                                             LANGDON
                           Yes.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           Then get in the car!
          
          Langdon jumps in the back seat of the car with Olivetti, and they
          SQUEAL away from the Archives.
          
          IN THE CAR,
          
          they continue as the DRIVER tears through the streets of Rome.
          
                                         OLIVETTI
                           We had no idea that --

                           You heard me ask permission!    You
                           assigned me an escort!    Don't try to
                           tell me you didn't know I was in
                           there!

                           Of course I knew, but we had no idea
                           that portions of our white zones are
          
                                        74.

                           cross-wired with that building.
                           Commander Rocher was extending the
                           search, if he'd known the Archives
                           were on that grid, he never would have
                           killed the power.
          
          Langdon looks at him evenly, sees in Olivetti's eyes that they may
          be thinking the same thing.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Or there is the other possibility.
          
          Olivetti doesn't answer.     But he's thinking about it.

                           He's found evidence that the Holy
                           Father was indeed murdered.    He is
                           seeking guidance.

          Vittoria, escorted by the two Swiss Guardsmen from the grottoes,
          returns to the papal office.
          
          She goes to the desk where she was sitting earlier, to resume her
          examination of the journals.
          
          But the desk is bare.
          
                                             VITTORIA

          The Guardsmen look at her blankly.

          INT      APOSTOLIC PALACE - GREAT STAIRCASE        NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo, in deep meditation, slowly descends the stairs
          that lead to the Sistine Chapel.
          
          At the bottom, Four Swiss Guard (in traditional garb) guard the
          locked doors.
          
          The Camerlengo reaches them.    Hesitates.      Looks heavenward for
          one last word of encouragement, and then --
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Unseal the doors.
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
          There is an audible GASP from the assembled cardinals as the heavy
          locks CLUNK open, the chains RATTLE away, and the main doors of
          the Sistine Chapel sweep open.
          
          The Camerlengo walks in, a stark presence in his black cassock
          amid the sea of red robes. Cardinal Mortati steps from behind the
          altar to meet him.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Signore, do you realize that for the
                           first time in Vatican history, a
                           Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred
                           threshold of conclave after sealing
                           the doors?

          EXT      ROME - STREET      NIGHT
          
          Olivetti's Alfa Romeo races through the streets of Rome, trailed
          by three other cars.
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo has just passed on the shocking news, and the
          whispered word "murder" can be heard in several languages.
          
          Even Mortati is shaken.   The Camerlengo speaks to the Cardinals.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO

          He strides quickly up the steps of the altar to address the group
          -- again, to the shock and surprise of this most conservative and
          rule-bound group.
          
          But no one stops him.

                           old enemy.    And this time they've
                           struck from within, murdering our Holy
                           Father and threatening us all with
                           destruction at the hands of their new

          CLOSE ON the dashboard clock in Olivetti's car, which now reads
          8:57.    Langdon looks up from it, staring intently through the
          windshield.
          
          On the horizon, he sees a faint orange glow.

                           Since the days of Galileo, the church
                           has tried to slow the relentless march
                           of science, sometimes with misguided
                           means, but always with benevolent
                           intention.    Still, they call us
                           backward, ignorant.

                           The promises of science have not been

          Santa Maria della Vittoria.    Flames glow like evil eyes through
          the stained-glass windows fifty feet above the ground.
          
          A small CROWD has gathered, stabbing at their cell phones.    A

          Mortati's Aide, Father Simeon, takes advantage of the open Sistine

          Mortati as the Camerlengo goes on.

                           simply too young to understand.    We

          With three sharp CRACKS, Olivetti fires into the lock in the front
          door of the church.    He KICKS it open --

          Olivetti, Langdon, and four other VATICAN POLICE make their way
          into the burning church.    There is a massive pile of church pews

          In the burning church, two heavy incensor cables run from the
          walls of the church and rise above the burning pews at an angle,
          strung tightly to a center point.    Langdon follows the wires up

          flames.
          
          A word is branded into the center of his bared chest:
          
                                           FIRE.

          Vatican Police, led by Olivetti and Vincenzo, race into the
          building and draw their weapons.    Olivetti SHOUTS to them in
          Italian, looking for a way to cut down the agonized cardinal.
          
          Langdon races toward the pyre, but is repelled by a wall of heat
          ten feet away.
          
          The Cardinal SCREAMS, and Langdon looks to the sides, following
          the cables that reach to the walls.
          
          One of the Vatican Cops ducks
          
          INTO THE LEFT SIDE AISLE,
          
          which is lit only by the wild orange flames.    He creeps forward,
          gun in front of him, toward a fire extinguisher mounted on the
          wall.
          
          He reaches for it --
          
          -- but a HAND reaches for him from behind, he's pulled off his
          feet and --
          
          IN THE MAIN AISLE,
          
          Olivetti and Vincenzo whirl as TWO GUNSHOTS come from the darkened
          side aisle.    They race toward it.
          
          AT THE BONFIRE,
          
          Langdon SHOUTS to two more Vatican Cops, pointing upward.

                            something to stand on!
          
          He's pointing at a cleat, maybe ten feet up on the wall, where the
          right guide wire is attached.
          
          Vatican Cops 2 & 3 drag a half-burned pew out of the fire and pull
          it underneath, leaning it against the wall for greater height,
          
          Langdon starts to climb it, to uncleat the wire.
          
          IN THE DARKENED LEFT AISLE
          
          Olivetti creeps forward, gun at the ready, Vincenzo close behind
          him.
          
          They see a form on the floor in front of them and Olivetti bends
          down -- it's the first Vatican Policeman.
          
          Dead in a pool of his own blood.

          Vincenzo, standing behind Olivetti, looks down, horrified, and in
          that moment of distraction, a figure creeps up behind him --
          
          -- and twists his head 180 degrees with one smooth motion.
          
          Olivetti whirls, but his gun comes around a split-second slower
          than he does and in that split-second a shadow falls over him,
          something SLASHES through the air and --
          
          IN THE MAIN AISLE,
          
          Langdon struggles to climb the pew that's leaned against the wall
          as Vatican Cop 4 finds a long-handled candle snuffer and races
          toward the edge of the fire with it.
          
          Blinking back the intense heat, he manages to hook the Cardinals
          manacled foot with it, he turns to Langdon--
          
           -- who, stretched as far as he possibly can, just manages to
          loose the wire from its cleat, holding tightly to it so as not to
          let the Cardinal go into free-fall.
          
          But the pew on which he's balanced starts to wobble, then- --
          
          -- BLAM!    BLAM!
          
          Two gunshots THUD into the chests of Vatican Cops 2 & 3, who were
          supporting the pew.    They fall, the pew tips --
          
          -- and Langdon,   falling   --
          
          -- loses his grip on the chain.
          
          The Cardinal falls toward the flames. Vatican Cop 4 tries to pull
          him to safety, but doesn't have enough of WHIRRS through the
          pulley until it reaches its the Cardinal to an abrupt stop, six
          feet lower
          
          -- and directly in the middle of the bonfire.
          
          His SHRIEK of agony echoes through the burning church.
          
          Langdon SLAMS to the floor just at the edge of the burning church
          pews, maybe CRACKING a rib on the hard floor of the church.
          
          A FIGURE steps out of the shadows, looming over him, Langdon looks
          up, expecting a gunshot, but instead --
          
           -- sees the bleeding figure of Olivetti, staggering toward him,
          clutching his slit throat in his last moments of life.
          
          NEARBY,
          
                                          81.
          
          
          
          Vatican Cop 4 is desperately trying to pull the Cardinal from the
          flames, the end of the candle-snuffer is now hooked around the
          Cardinal's foot, he pulls him closer, reaches out, can almost grab
          his ankle --
          
           -- until he is SHOT in the back.    He falls to the floor,
          drawing and dropping his gun in the process, losing his grip on
          the long-handled pole as well.
          
          On the ground, bleeding, he sees his gun, just a foot away from
          his hand.
          
          He reaches for it.
          
          And a foot steps on his wrist, BREAKING it.
          
          Mr. Gray stands over him,     implacable.
          
          FROM A DISTANCE,
          
          we see Mr. Gray fire two shots into the ground where Cop 4 is
          lying.
          
          Then he turns toward us.
          
          NEARBY,
          
          Langdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots.
          Through the burning church pews he can see Mr. Gray, starting
          toward him.
          
          Langdon crawls, on all fours, through the outskirts of the
          bonfire, toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet
          away.
          
          Mr. Gray steps up behind him, raises his gun           --
          
                                                VOICE   (O.S.)
                             Polizia!
          
           -- and turns.    TWO MORE COPS, Roman Carbinieri, have run into
          the burning church and are making their way down the center aisle,
          straight toward him.
          
          Mr. Gray raises his left (non-gun holding) hand, displaying a
          leather billfold with a badge in it.
          
                                           MR. GRAY
                                  (good Italian accent)
                             Gendarmeria Vaticano!
          
          Recognizing the ID, the two Cops glance away for a second, to
          search the rest of the church --
          
                                         82.
          
          
          
          -- and Mr. Gray BLASTS two shots into each of them.
          
          They drop, dead, but one of them squeezes off a single round
          before falling.
          
          Mr. Gray looks down, at his right shoulder, where a dark red stain
          is spreading on his suit.    He touches it, more annoyed than
          anything.
          
          UNDERNEATH THE BURNING PEWS,
          
          Langdon has crawled as close as he dares to the raging fire, and
          the sleeve of his shirt is ablaze.    He rolls out the other side
          of the embers, stamping out the flames, gets to his feet, and
          takes off running.
          
          Mr. Gray pursues, only slowing his gait slightly to DOUBLE TAP two
          shots into the head of a dying Vatican Cop.
          
          ACROSS THE CHURCH,
          
          Langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the
          far side of the church.    Bullets SHATTER the glass of an
          elevated crypt, three feet off the floor.    (Inside is a superbly
          detailed wax statue of a saint in death.)
          
          Langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at
          Mr. Gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the
          church.
          
          Langdon's back THUDS into a wall.
          
          Dead end.
          
          But there's an old wooden grating in the wall.   He turns, KICKS
          it with both feet.
          
          The grating CRUNCHES into pieces, revealing a narrow crawlspace
          
          IN THE CRAWL SPACE,
          
          Langdon army-crawls through it.
          
          Mr. Gray's face appears in the entry to the crypt.    He pauses to
          change clips on his handgun --
          
          -- the floor beneath Langdon abruptly runs out   --
          
          -- Mr. Gray raises his gun     --
          
           -- and Langdon disappears. The gunshots THUD into cement wall
          where he was, not where he is.
          
                                         83.
          
          
          
          UNDERGROUND,
          
          Langdon CRUNCHES to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor,
          rolls over, and sees Mr. Gray above him, now pointing down.
          
          But there's another crawl space, and Langdon scurries into it.
          
          IN THE SECOND CRAWL SPACE,
          
          it's hopelessly dark, an even tighter space than the last one,
          filled with cobwebs that Langdon blindly claws his way through.
          
          He hits another hole in the floor, falls a second time ---
          
          INTO THE CATACOMB,
          
           -- and lands on top of a pile of long-decayed skeletons in the
          nearly-black bottom of the church's underground warren of hiding
          places.
          
          He looks up.    He's ten feet from the nearest handhold, only a
          fool would follow him down here
          
          BACK UP IN THE BURNING CHURCH,
          
           -- and Mr. Gray is no fool.      He steps back over the balustrade
          and leaves the chapel.
          
          The waxen face of the carving in the sarcophagus melts in the
          intense heat of the out-of-control fire.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          INT      SISTINE CHAPEL - SALON        NIGHT
          
          In the salon outside the Sistine Chapel, the Camerlengo waits
          alone.    From inside can be heard the sound of VOICES in debate.
          
          Finally, the big doors open and Cardinal Mortati emerges, goes to
          him.
          
                                          MORTATI
                            My son... God answers all prayers.
          
          He puts a hand on the Camerlengo's shoulder.
          
                                          MORTATI (cont'd)
                            But sometimes the answer is no.
          
          The Camerlengo closes his eyes    -- this is a terrible, terrible
          mistake.
          
                                       84.
          
          
          
                                         MORTATI

                           We can't hide this anymore.        The
                           burning church --
          
                                         MORTATI
                           A despicable act of terrorism.
                           Father Simeon will make a suitable
                           announcement lamenting the loss of
                           life.      May I suggest you direct
                           your energies to helping the Swiss
                           Guard confront the possibility of this
                           explosive device, and leave church
                           leadership --
          
          He gestures to the open doors to the Sistine Chapel, and the
          assembled cardinals within.
          
                                         MORTATI       (cont'd)
                            -- to its leaders.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him for a long moment, then turns and
          wa1ks away.
          
          Father Simeon, who had been lurking in the open doorway to the
          chapel, now glides up beside him and touches Mortati's arm.

                           Eminence.    There is a growing fear
                           that without the four prefiriti, a two-
                           thirds majority for any candidate may
                           be impossible.    Unless --
          
          He trails off, gestures vaguely.
          
                                             MORTATI
                           Speak plainly.
          
                                         FR. SIMEON
                           It is the recommendation of many that
                           you ask to be removed from your post
                           as Great Elector --
          
          Mortati raises an eyebrow, seeing where this is going.
          
                                         FR. SIMEON (cont'd)
                            -- thereby making yourself eligible
                           to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.
          
                                       85.
          
          
          
          Mortati looks at him for a moment, then looks back, over his
          shoulder, where a small knot of Cardinals, who have clearly
          discussed this, are looking at him in confirmation.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           If it is God's will, may His will be

          computations; the other half with a scratchy handwritten prose.
          
          (IF WE'RE EAGLE-EYED, we'll notice the phrase we move past just as
          we cut into the scene is "may His will be done," the same phrase
          we just heard Mortati utter.)
          
          Commandante Rocher is at his desk, Vittoria's leather-bound
          journals on the desk in front of him.    He's studying them
          carefully, and seems troubled by what he reads.
          
          Through the glass walls of his office, we can see a commotion in
          the still-chaotic Swiss Guard headquarters.    Someone is walking
          toward us, briskly, a WOMAN'S VOICE complaining loudly in Italian.
          
          Rocher calmly places the journals on top of the screen of the
          video monitor inlaid in his desk, the one we saw earlier, with a
          keyhole where a power switch should be.
          
          He pushes a button and the monitor rotates shut, into an inlaid
          panel in the desk's surface.    It closes just after --
          
                                         VITTORIA (O.S.)
                           Those journals are private property.

                           They are material evidence in a

                           country, with its own laws, and when
                           those journals crossed our border they

          hidden panel is visible in the veneer of the wood.

          has gathered, along with a dozen police and fire vehicles.
          
          INT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA        NIGHT
          
          As FIREMEN put out the last of the flames (not using water, but
          Halon gas, which creates no steam), a metallic TAPPING sound comes
          from somewhere.
          
          One of the Firemen approaches another, gets his attention   -- stop
          what you're doing and listen.
          
          They shut down a hose and stop, listening.
          
          There it is again.    They SHOUT in Italian to the others, now
          everybody shuts down their hoses and listens.
          
          The metallic TAPPING echoes in the smoldering church.
          
          They walk toward it -- it's coming from an oval plate in the
          floor, like a manhole cover, heavy and carved.   We've seen one
          of these before, it leads to a Demon's Hole.
          
          The TAPPING is louder now, rhythmic.    Somebody's down there.
          Crowbars are produced, the cover of the Demon's Hole is pried off
          and shoved aside, revealing --
          
                                        87.
          
          
          
           -- Robert Langdon, wedged into the top of the opening, holding a
          rock in one hand as he clings precariously to the walls he has
          climbed.
          
          Strong hands reach down, haul him to his feet      --
          
          AT THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH,
          
           -- and those same feet hurry to the front of the smoldering
          church, coming to a stop in front of --
          
          -- Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Teresa.
          
          The statue he came here to find.    Now, as the Italian-speaking
          police and firemen work around him, Langdon moves, as if in his
          own world.    He looks to the statue, repeating fragments of the
          poem he has by now memorized:
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Let angels guide you on your lofty
                           quest...
          
          Directly over the recumbent saint, against a backdrop of gilded
          flame, hovers Bernini's angel.    The angel's hand clutches a
          pointed spear of fire.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           Cross Rome the mystic elements
                           unfold...
          
          Langdon's eyes follow the direction of the shaft, arcing toward
          the right side of the church.
          
                                              VOICE (O.S.)
                           Professor?
          
          A ROMAN POLICEMAN, a member of the Carbinieri, comes up to
          Langdon, discussing him in Italian with TWO OTHER COPS as he
          approaches.
          
                                         ROMAN COP
                           Langdon, is it?
          
          Langdon ignores him, pointing at the wall instead.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           What direction is that?
          
                                         ROMAN COP
                           Direction?   West, I think.    Mr.
                           Langdon, we've confirmed with the
                           Vatican that they invited you into
                           this investigation, but what I-
          
                                         88.
          
          
          
                                               LANGDON
                              Map.
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          as if by command, a map CRINKLES out on the floor of the church.
          It's detailed, a fire department map, and Langdon drops down on
          all fours, studying it.
          
                                            LANGDON
                              We're here... Piazza Barberini...
          
          Langdon whips a glance over at the angel, gets bearings, and
          rotates the map to match.
          
          His finger travels over the map and      --
          
          CLOSE ON THE MAP,
          
          we watch as his finger crosses church after church after church,
          tiny black boxes with crosses in them.    There must be two dozen.
          
                                               LANGDON
                              Damn it.
          
          He sits back for a moment.
          
          The Roman Cop bends down next to him.          Treats him like a crazy
          person.
          
                                            ROMAN COP
                              Professor, I need to know what you saw
                              here.
          
                                            LANGDON
                              Fire and death.    Show me where Santa
                              Maria del Popolo is.
                                   (the Cop doesn't
                                    UNDERSTAND)
                              The Church, it was the first altar of
                              science.
          
          The Cop points to a spot at the top center of the map.
          
                                            LANGDON      (cont'd)
                              And St. Peter's is...
          
          The Cop points to a spot at the bottom center.
          
          Langdon's eyes widen, he grabs the Cop by the lapels       --
          
          -- and pulls a pen from the man's pocket.
          
                                       89.
          
          
          
          He turns back to the map and draws a straight line, from north to
          south, connecting the two churches the Cop just pointed to.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           And we're over here --
          
          He puts the pen on a point on the eastern side of the map.
          
                                         LANGDON       (cont'd)
                            -- and west is --
          
          He draws a line straight across the map, to the west, sucking in
          his breath as he realizes something.
          
                                             LANGDON   (cont'd)
                           'Cross Rome...
          
          Now he stands, slowly, and as he stands, we rise up, to get a
          birds-eye view of the map on the floor.
          
          On which he has drawn a perfect cross.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           It's a cross.    The poem meant it
                           literally.    The four altars of
                           science form a perfect cross.
          
          The Cop, who has no clue what he's talking about, gets a call on
          his radio and turns away to take it.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)

                           Which means the fourth element, water,
                           should be right about --
          
          He drops to his knees again, and traces the horizontal line to
          where it stops on the western side of the city, exactly as far
          from the center line as was the church on the eastern side.
          
                                             LANGDON   (cont'd)

                           Professor, I am asked to escort you to
                           the Vatican immediately.    Commander
                           Rocher has asked to see you.
          
                                         LANGDON
                                (ignoring him)

          As Langdon peers down, we see the line on the map comes to a stop
          in the center of a place called Piazza Navona, and as we go in
          closer on the map, an odd-shaped object in the middle of the
          Piazza starts to move, to ripple, right there on the map, and we
          hear the sound of running water as it slowly dissolves to --
          
                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          
          EXT      PIAZZA NAVONA        NIGHT
          
           -- Bernini's spectacular Fountain of the Four Rivers in the
          Piazza Navona.
          
          There is a black van parked beside the fountain, and we drift over
          toward it.    Passing through the passenger window, we go inside
          to find --
          
           -- Mr. Gray, facing the rear of the van, his jacket off and his
          shirt open, engaged in battlefield surgery on his injured right
          shoulder.    Using a long-handled tweezers, he digs into his own
          flesh, gets a hold of the bullet that pierced him, and tosses it
          onto the metal floor of the van with a TING.
          
          It lands beside a lumpy tarp, and as metal hits metal, the tarp
          jumps.
          
          There's a human being in there.       Mr. Gray speaks to the lump.
          
                                         MR. GRAY
                           Were it up to me, it would not be this
                           way.    It is a sin to kill with pain.

                           But I am a sinner.
          
          We pan off him quickly and look out the driver's window, up at a
          clock tower on the far side of the plaza.
          
          It's sixteen minutes to eleven.
          
                                                                        CUT TO:
          
          EXT     BURNING CHURCH        NIGHT
          
          Langdon hurries down the steps of the still-smoldering church,
          followed closely by the Roman Cop and TWO OTHER COPS.
          
                                            ROMAN COP

                            The Vatican is about to see its fourth
                            Cardinal murdered tonight.
          
          He realizes he spoke too loudly, and there is quite a crowd
          assembled outside the smoking church.    Langdon lowers his voice
          and presses in.
          
                                          LANGDON (cont'd)
                            Now you can either do what they tell
                            you and force me to go to the Vatican,
                            where we can all mourn his death
                            together, or you can show them how
                            real cops act and take me to the
                            Piazza Navona, where we might be able
                            to stop it.
          
          The Cop looks at him, thinking, confers with another Cop in rapid
          Italian.    Langdon checks his watch.

                            By all means, talk it over.    But in
                            fourteen minutes he'll be dead.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:

                           peril, give the order to evacuate the
                           cardinals.    But with dignity, let
                           them exit into St. Peter's Square,
                           with their heads held high.    I don't
                           want the last image of this church to
                           be frightened old men sneaking out a
                           back door.    If Cardinal Mortati
                           protests, escort him bodily.    Do you
                           understand?
          
          The Guardsmen are uncomfortable with that idea.

                           If you think it is the right thing,

                           I'm certain it's the wrong thing,
                           and I will be removed from my post
                           for it.    But I also know we have
                           no choice.
          
          They just look at him.   You're the boss.

          They get out.    He stares into the flames.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          
          
          EXT      PIAZZA NAVONA      NIGHT
          
          Piazza Navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night with so
          much attention directed toward the Vatican.
          
          The hood of a car glides into view, nearly silent, on the far side
          of the fountain.    Langdon and the two Roman Cops step out and
          survey the area.
          
          Langdon looks to the fountain.    Its central core is twenty feet
          tall, a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through
          which water churns.    Atop it stands an obelisk that climbs
          another forty feet.

                           Let angels guide you...
          
          But there's no angel anywhere.      He turns to the first Roman Cop.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)
                           Isn't there an angel on this fountain?
          
                                             ROMAN COP
                           Not anymore.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           The marker's no good without an angel,
                           pointing to the final-
          
                                         ROMAN COP
                           Blame Mussolini.    He wanted it for
                           his summer-
          
          But the Cop stops mid-sentence as he notices the black van parked
          on the far side of the fountain.
          
          Silently, the Cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways
          around the fountain, and to Langdon to stay where he is.
          
          Langdon, frustrated but no action hero, watches them as they
          slowly encircle the van.
          
          AT THE DRIVER'S SIDE,
          
          the First Cop approaches the Driver's Window, sees Mr. Gray
          sitting implacably behind the wheel.    He taps lightly with a
          knuckle, his drawn gun at his side, just out of view.
          
                                           94.
          
          
          
          Mr. Gray opens the window.
          
                                                 MR. GRAY
                             Si?
          
          The Roman Cop looks down, ever so briefly, at a small spreading
          bloodstain on Mr. Gray's shirt.    When he looks back up --
          
          -- there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him.
          
          PHOOM.
          
          He takes a bullet in the forehead, slumps forward against the
          window, and --
          
          FROM A DISTANCE,
          
          we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the driver's
          window.    Whole thing took about three seconds.    DINERS at an
          outdoor cafe don't even notice.
          
          FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,
          
          on the other side of the fountain, the van rocks slightly, but he
          can't see anything out of the ordinary.
          
          He turns, looks to the Second Cop, who is just now approaching
          from the rear of the van.
          
          WITH THE SECOND COP,
          
          this one's got his gun in front of him, he's ready for anything.
          We creep around the back of the van with him, and just as he comes
          around to where he can see the driver's side --
          
           -- the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead.   A
          quick exchange in Italian:
          
                                                 SECOND COP
                             Per favore?
          
                                                 MR. GRAY
                             Non posso.
          
          PHOOM.
          
          Another bullet, another slumping Cop, and
          
          FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,
          
          the van rocks again, but he can't see anything more detailed than
          that.    All he knows is the two cops aren't coming out from the
          other side of the van, something is going on --
          
                                        95.
          
          
          
          -- and the bell in the clock tower starts to BONG.
          
          EVEN UNARMED,   LANGDON STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD,   JUST AS   --
          
          -- the sliding door on the fountain side of the van SLAMS open
          
           -- revealing the figure of the FOURTH CARDINAL, wrapped in chains
          and with manacled hands and feet.    He thrashes against the iron
          links, but the chains are too heavy.    One of the links bisects
          his mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help.    Mr.
          Gray hovers over him.
          
          Langdon GASPS   --
          
          -- and Mr. Gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van.
          
          The Cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous
          SPLASH.    His weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom.
          
          There is a moment, frozen in time, in which Langdon locks eyes
          with Mr. Gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock
          tower continues to BONG, the only sound we can hear.
          
          Langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then
          back up at Mr. Gray--
          
          -- who salutes him ---
          
          -- the van door SLAMS shut, and the van tears ass out of there.
          
          Langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police
          car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but
          then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal
          must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all.
          
          Langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides
          and leaps in.
          
          IN THE FOUNTAIN,
          
          the water is waist deep and like ice.    Steady streams of bubbles
          rise up from the bottom, churning it.
          
          Langdon reaches the body of the Cardinal, plunges in   --
          
          UNDERWATER,
          
          -- and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man.
          
          Through the watery haze, we can see the man's bare chest, branded
          with the final ambigram:
          
                                         WATER.
          
                                       96.
          
          
          
          Langdon struggles to lift him, but the weight is too much, he can
          barely get him a few inches off the bottom of the fountain, much
          less all the way to the surface.
          
          Langdon, running out of air, bursts to the surface and   -- ON THE
          SURFACE,
          
          -- takes a deep breath, then plunges back   --
          
          UNDERWATER,
          
          -- but he still can't move the Cardinal.
          
          He makes eye contact with the dying man, who seems to be accepting
          his fate, maybe even welcoming it.
          
          Langdon changes his grip, strains like hell, and actually gets him
          a few inches higher this time, but nowhere close to the air
          supply.
          
          But with the new position, his eyes fall on something behind the
          cardinal -- a plastic tube, six inches across, streaming bubbles
          into the fountain.
          
          He goes back   --
          
          ABOVE THE SURFACE
          
           -- takes another breathy and sees the fountain of bubbles rising
          up to the surface just above the tube.    Air!
          
          Several PASSERS-BY notice the commotion in the fountain as Langdon
          dives back under the water.
          
          UNDERWATER,
          
          Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the
          bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its mooring,
          pulling it to the Cardinal's mouth.
          
          He clamps it down over the man's lips, and the Cardinal sucks a
          few greedy breaths from it.    Enough to keep him alive.
          
          Langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own, then
          digs his hands back underneath the Cardinal to lift him, but this
          time --
          
          -- SIX MORE HANDS come in from all sides.
          
          Several Passers-by have jumped into the fountain to help, and as
          they all strain together --
          
                                         97.
          
          
          
          ON THE SURFACE,
          
           -- the Cardinal's bound body breaks the surface and he GULPS deep
          lungfuls of air.
          
          He is saved.    Langdon sags against the side of the fountain,
          exhausted and freezing, as the others pull the Cardinal's body to
          safety.
          
          In the distance, SIRENS.
          
          Langdon, gathering himself, goes to the Cardinal, speaks in rapid
          Spanish, subtitled.
          
                                          LANGDON

          Guidera nods weakly as, around them, it seems like everybody
          arrives at the fountain -- Carbinieri, Swiss Guard, Vatican
          Police, paramedics -- car after car after car.

          Commander Rocher selects a pistol and slips it into a harness.
          
          While his back is turned to the room, Lt. Chartrand, the young
          Swiss Guardsman who escorted Langdon to the Archives, hurries up
          behind him.
          
                                          CHARTRAND
                            Langdon says Cardinal Guidera will be
                            killed in Piazza Navona.    He's on
                            his way there with two Carbinieri.

          He closes and locks the cabinet, heads for the door.     Alone.
          
                                             CHARTRAND

                           for the explosive.
          
          He leaves.    Chartrand looks back at the weapons cabinet.     Sees
          the space from which the pistol was taken.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:

          We fly over a bridge, flanked by a dozen angel statues standing
          sentinel on either side, leading directly toward--
          
           -- the Castel Sant'Angelo, Castle of the Angels, its ancient
          stone ramparts lit by floodlights.    Soaring swiftly up its
          facade, we close in on a mammoth bronze angel standing atop the
          citadel.
          
          It points the way, all right, its sword aimed directly downward,
          at the castle itself, as if to say you've found it.
          
          DOWN ON THE GROUND,
          
          several Police Cars come to a stop in front of the castle at the
          same time.
          
          Langdon climbs out the back of one just as Vittoria gets out of a
          car driven by a SWISS GUARDSMAN.
          
          Langdon grabs her, thrilled to see her.

          More Cops arrive, and a SECURITY GUARD is pressed into service
          behind them, opening the massive front doors to the Castle,
          
                                          LANGDON
                            This is it.    The Church of
                            Illumination is somewhere in the
                            castle.
          
          Cops pour into the courtyard of the castle.       Langdon and
          Vittoria follow.
          
          
          
          EXT     CASTEL SANT'ANGELO - COURTYARD          NIGHT
          
          They dash around the outer bulwark of the Castle.       The courtyard
          beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare     -- catapults,
          stacks of marble cannonballs, fearful contraptions.
          
          As the Cops quickly and silently search every nook, Langdon and
          Vittoria follow closely.

                            The Vatican used this place for
                            centuries as a hideout, a prison for
                            enemies of the church -- there are
                            passages and catacombs everywhere. It
                            makes sense, the Illuminati
                            infiltrated the Church's own
                            stronghold.    Bernini was chief
                            architect here, he left clues
                            everywhere, it's even surrounded by a
                            pentagonal park!
          
          They reach the central core of the castle.
          
          Another angel statue, similar to the one atop the citadel, stands
          in front of them, its sword held in the same position, pointing
          downward at an angle.
          
          Langdon studies it, follows the line of the angel's sword       -- and
          sees a gated drive that cuts across the courtyard itself.
          
                                             LANGDON   (cont'd)
                            There.
          
          A MOMENT LATER,
          
          he and Vittoria are down in the courtyard, at the mouth of the
          gated drive. The gate is open and leads to a tunnel, a gaping
          entry in the central core.
          
                                        100.

                              A traforo.    Commanders on horseback
                              used them to ride directly into a
                              castle from the outside.
          
          He gestures to the nearby Cops, who are already on it, and they
          all head into the darkened tunnel.
          
          INT   TUNNEL       NIGHT
          
          Police flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily off
          the walls of the tunnel.
          
          Footsteps CRUNCH as they all press in, Langdon and Vittoria
          content to let men with guns lead the way.
          
          It gets darker as they descend, and then, by the echo of their
          footfalls, they can tell they've entered --
          
          A LARGE CHAMBER.
          
          More lights are switched on, illuminating the space, which
          terminates in three stone walls.

          But the Police attention is focused on the black van parked in the
          center of the room.
          
          Roman Police snap into action, flashlight beams bounce everywhere,
          guns point in every possible window of the van, SHOUTS for
          whoever's inside to get the hell out now, now, now.
          
          The doors are flung open.
          
          The van is empty.
          
          Except for the two dead policemen from the Piazza Navona.
          
          The police frenzy reaches an even higher level, URGENT MESSAGES
          passed along on radios, half the Cops turning and heading back out
          of the tunnel.

          posted outside the van, guarding their fallen colleagues.

          Langdon walks forward, to the stone wall at the end of the tunnel,
          and feels his way along it.
          
          It joins smoothly with the wall on the right side.

          But he waves her off, this has to be it.    He feels all along the
          wall toward the other corner, and as he looks down at the ground,
          his eyes widen.

          Vittoria borrows a flashlight from one of the two remaining Cops,
          who now get a CRACKLY MESSAGE on their walkie-talkies and race out
          of the tunnel, toward the top, leaving Langdon and Vittoria alone
          in the dead end.
          
          She brings the light to Langdon, who shines its beam down at the
          floor.    There, in the corner, is a granite block.
          
                                         LANGDON (cont'd)

                           And they're all square.
          
          He bends down, looks closer.

                           This one's a pentagram.   It points --
          
          Sure enough, the block is carved in the shape of a pentagram, with
          the tip pointing into the corner.
          
                                         LANGDON           (cont'd)
                            -- at nothing.
          
          But as he shines the light, there's something off about the shadow
          it casts in the corner of the room.    It creates an odd, dark
          slit.
          
          Langdon crouches in the corner and slides his hand along the back
          wall of the chamber.    When he reaches the point at which it
          should intersect the side wall --
          
                                        102.

                              The walls overlap.
          
          He flattens himself against the back wall, shining the light
          straight at what should be the intersection of the walls.    Half
          the flashlight's beam falls on the side wall, and the other half --
          
          INT     SECRET PASSAGE         NIGHT
          
          -- shines through into the secret passage behind the wall.
          
          Langdon draws in his breath and forces himself through the tiny
          slit, just wide enough for a determined person to squeeze through.
          
          Vittoria follows.
          
          They look ahead, shining the light. They're in an extremely narrow
          passageway.
          
          They start carefully down it, flashlight in front of them.   They
          whisper.

          To their right, they pass half a dozen tiny jail cells, the iron
          bars on most eroded away.    Several of the larger cells are
          intact, and on the floor of one they see black robes and red
          sashes.
          
          They approach an iron doorway in the wall. The door is ajar and
          beyond it there is some sort of passage. Langdon squints at two
          words above it -- II Passetto.
          
          Vittoria gestures    -- that way?
          
          Langdon shakes his head no.

          They round a corner, where the tunnel takes a ninety degree turn
          to the right.    At the corner, Langdon notices another
          pentagrammal block in the floor.
          
          He bends, studies the direction it's pointing,         feels the wall    --

                           Another overlap.
          
           -- and finds another overlapping angle, this one even smaller
          than the last.    The wall is actually joined at the floor, seems
          to open out at the middle (in roughly the shape of a human form
          turned sideways), and joins again at the top.
          
          HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH,   SLIPS THROUGH THE GAP        --
          
          -- and finds himself at the base of a set of steep spiral stairs.
          
          Langdon looks up, to the top of the stairs.            There is an
          archway, adorned with a tiny carved angel.
          
          Vittoria slips through the gap, sees the carving too.

          get our first good look at it.
          
          The embellishments, though faded, are replete with familiar
          symbology.    Pentagram tiles.    Planet frescoes.    Pyramids.

          Langdon nods, but he's fascinated by the place.
          
          In the center of the room, there is an open fireplace, its embers
          still smoking.    The four Illuminati brands, their faces wiped
          clean, have been placed back in a molded velvet case.
          
          Langdon, fascinated, spots an empty slot in the very center of the
          case, surrounded by the four used brands.
          
          But this one's missing.
          
          Vittoria arrives over his shoulder, having completed a quick

                           Please place your gun on the floor.
          
          They freeze. Vittoria looks at Langdon, who nods     -- you'd better
          do it.    She does.
          
                                         MR. GRAY       (cont'd)

          They turn and face Mr. Gray.    He looks quite dapper, and not too
          much the worse for wear.    There is a briefcase on the ground
          beside him, and he's changed into a fresh shirt.
          
                                             MR. GRAY   (cont'd)
                           Kick it to me.
          
          She does.    He picks it up, ejects the clip and the round in the
          chamber, pockets them, and tosses the gun into the smoldering
          fire.

                           for money.    Which do you take me
                           for?
          
          As if to answer his own question, he picks up the briefcase from
          the floor beside him.    Then studies Langdon for a moment.
          
                                       106.

                            Neither are you. I was expecting a
                            fanatic.
          
                                          MR. GRAY
                            When they call me -- and they all
                            call me -- it is so important to
                            them that I know what they ask is
                            the Lord's will.    Or Allah's, or
                            Yahweh's.    And I suppose they're
                            right.    Because if He were not
                            vengeful, I would not exist, would
                            I?
          
          He picks up his briefcase.
          
                                              MR. GRAY (cont'd)
                            Be careful.        These are men of God.
          
          He turns to go.    Langdon can't help himself:
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Why didn't you kill us when you had
                            the chancer
          
          Vittoria looks at Langdon like he's nuts.        Mr. Gray turns back,
          seems puzzled by the very thought.
          
                                          MR. GRAY
                            Because no one asked me to.
          
          He leaves.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria pause for a moment, look at each other     --

          Rocher reaches the office of the Pope. Two uniformed Swiss Guard
          are stationed outside.
          
          Another Swiss Guardsman steps out of the office, reporting back
          from within.

                           I'd like to see him alone.
          
          The Swiss Guards look at each other.
          
                                         SWISS GUARDSMAN

          Rocher is truly intimidating when he wants to be.

                           No,   sir.
          
          He nods to the other Guards, who raise their swords, allowing
          access.
          
                                                                        CUT TO:

          Vittoria and Langdon barrel down the stone stairs, into the

          INT     IL PASSETTO      NIGHT
          
          The passetto is narrow and dark, lit only by streaks of moonlight
          coming through the vertical slits in the walls.
          
          But up ahead, there's light.      They race for it.
          
                                                                        CUT TO:

          The Camerlengo kneels in prayer in front of the fire. He hears a
          sound behind him and turns as the door to the papal office opens.
          
          Rocher enters, closes and locks the door behind him.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO

          Vittoria and Langdon race up a flight of stairs, and the passetto
          comes out into the open for a hundred yards or so as it leaves the
          Castel Sant'Angelo.
          
          Ahead, they see a rope ladder over the side.        They look down.
          
          Directly below them, Mr. Gray is getting into an Alfa Romeo parked
          discretely at the end of a dead end street, making his escape.
          
          DOWN ON THE STREET,
          
          the car door SLAMS.
          
          IN THE CAR,
          
          Mr. Gray turns the key.
          
          UP ON THE PASSETTO,
          
          Langdon and Vittoria are running toward the Vatican again when the
          EXPLOSION rips through the still night.
          
          They stagger and turn back, in time to see Mr. Gray's car go up in
          an enormous fireball.

          Langdon grabs her arm and they take off.        The Passetto descends
          again, into --
          
          INT       IL PASSETTO       NIGHT
          
           -- another underground space.        The outline of a steel gate
          looms ahead, blocking their way.
          
          But as they draw closer, they find the ancient lock hanging open,
          and the gate swings freely.    This tunnel has been used, and
          recently.
          
          FURTHER AHEAD,
          
          they plow onward, and now there is a low ROARING sound from above
          them.    Langdon pauses, looks up.

          In the hallway outside the Pope's office, there are raised VOICES
          from behind the closed door.    Lt. Chartrand approaches
          nervously.
          
          He and the Guards look at each other, don't know what to do. From
          the other direction, Father Simeon, Cardinal Mortati's Aide,
          strides toward them.
          
                                          FR. SIMEON
                            I demand to speak to the Camerlengo.
          
          AN ANGRY SHOUT from behind the door draws their attention --what
          the hell is going on in there?
          
                                                                         CUT TO:

          Langdon and Vittoria hit another gate, this one heavier, but it
          too is unlocked.    The sound of St. Peter's Square fades behind
          them now.
          
          UP AHEAD,
          
          they turn a corner and, without warning --- the tunnel ends.
          
          There is only a thick iron door, and as Langdon searches it with
          his flashlight, he finds no handle, no knob, no keyhole, no
          hinges.

          With a ROAR of anger, he starts to POUND on the door.      Vittoria
          joins in.

          CLOSE ON a watch -- 11:40.     Outside the door to the Pope's
          office, Lt. Chartrand is desperate.
          
          While Father Simeon attempts to argue with him in Italian,
          Chartrand turns, hearing the POUNDING coming from down the hall.
          
          He heads toward it, rounds a corner   --
          
          INT      POPE'S PRIVATE LIBRARY       NIGHT
          
           -- and steps into the Pope's private library, where the POUNDING
          is louder.
          
                                      110.
          
          
          
          He steps to a heavy door in the wall, looks unused for a century,
          but it's clearly the source of the sounds.    He looks down, sees
          three keyholes in the door, and an ancient key in each of them.
          
          Chartrand puts his ear to the door, hears VOICES    --
          
          INT     IL PASSETTO      NIGHT
          
           -- and, on the other side, Langdon and Vittoria squint at the
          light as the heavy door is hauled open before them.
          
          Chartrand looks at them in amazement    -- how'd you get here?

          Chartrand, Langdon, and Vittoria round the corner and race down
          the hallway toward the Pope's office, just as --
          
           -- a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM comes from behind the closed doors. The
          Swiss Guard move fast, throwing open the door.
          
          INT      POPE'S OFFICE      NIGHT
          
          Langdon and the others race into the pope's office and find a
          truly bizarre scene.
          
          Rocher is near the fireplace, brandishing his sidearm, aimed at
          the Camerlengo, who lays on the floor, writhing in agony.
          
          His cassock is torn open, and his bare chest is seared black.     A
          large, square brand is on the floor at Rocher's feet.
          
          Two of the Swiss Guard act without hesitation    -- they open fire.
          
          Two bullets SLAM into Rocher's chest and he crumples.
          
          Father Simeon bursts into the room, and as he does the Camerlengo
          rolls over onto one side, points his index finger at Simeon, and
          cries out a single word:
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                           ILLUMINATUS!
          
                                             FR. SIMEON
                           You bastard!        You sanctimonious-
          
          He rushes at the Camerlengo and Chartrand reacts on instinct,
          putting three bullets in Father Simeon's back.
          
                                         111.
          
          
          
          He falls to the floor, dead.
          
          Chartrand and the Guards dash to the Camerlengo, who clutches his
          chest, convulsing in pain.
          
          Langdon walks toward him, stunned, as the Guards pull the
          Camerlengo's hands away from his wound, revealing the fifth brand.
          
          The crossed keys, seared into the flesh of his chest.
          
          Langdon looks at Rocher in utter disbelief. Rocher's still alive,
          trying to say something, holding out a hand.
          
          Everyone else in the room is focused on the Camerlengo, so Langdon
          bends down, takes the dying man's hand.
          
          Rocher looks up at him, desperation in his eyes, trying to
          communicate something but too weak to say more than:
          
                                                ROCHER
                           For safety.
          
          And his eyes close.
          
          Langdon withdraws his hand from Rocher's, and finds the dying man
          has pressed something into his palm.
          
          A key.
          
          Langdon looks at it, and it gives him a thought. He turns, looks
          at the Camerlengo, whose chest is exposed.
          
          The crossed keys are indeed branded there      -- but they're upside
          down.
          
          Langdon slips the key in his pocket and approaches the Camerlengo
          as Chartrand gets to his feet, on his radio.
          
                                         CHARTRAND

          The Camerlengo struggles to a sitting position.

          They race down the center aisle, to the candlelit balustrade which
          surrounds the winding staircase into the grottoes.

          The Camerlengo drops to his knees and opens an iron grate in the
          marble floor.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:

          Vittoria, Langdon, the Camerlengo, and Chartrand drop down through
          an open hole and into an underground city of ancient, winding
          streets.    Part museum, part ruin, they run past ancient
          structures, some hundreds, some thousands of years old.
          
          The rectangular tombs are similar to little houses, complete with
          doorways, thresholds, windows, and terraces.
          
          AROUND A CORNER,
          
          the Camerlengo seems to know exactly where he's going; he leads
          them down a narrow stone passageway.
          
          AROUND ANOTHER CORNER,
          
          they hurry up a small hill.    At the top of the grade, there is a
          stone grotto, toward which the Camerlengo is racing.
          
          He reaches the grotto, searches, but finds nothing.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria come to a stop behind him, breathing hard.

          He rips aside some protective tarps, finds that underneath the
          actual burial site is an underground area, part of a dig in
          progress.
          
          He climbs down into it, we see just the top of his head as   --
          
          -- a soft glow seems to emanate from beneath him.
          
          The Camerlengo's head is wreathed in light for a moment, and then,
          as he climbs out, we see that he's holding in his hands --
          
          -- the glowing canister of anti-matter.
          
          ON THE GROUND NEARBY,
          
          Vittoria drops to her knees, a tiny silver pellet in one hand, two
          wires leading from opposite ends of it.

          She leans down, reaching for the canister's baseplate.
          
          As she does, a drop of sweat rolls to the tip of her nose She

          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA           NIGHT
          
          They hurry across the floor of St. Peter's Basilica and burst out
          the huge doors that open onto St. Peter's Square, just as --
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          -- the helicopter lifts off.
          
          The Crowd watches in amazement, and the PILOT stands in the
          square, talking animatedly to two Swiss Guard, gesturing toward
          the helicopter.    But if he's not flying it...
          
          Langdon looks up at the helicopter as it climbs, straight upward.
          
                                                 LANGDON
                            Oh my God...
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo is indeed at the controls of the helicopter,
          piloting it upwards and away from the crowd below.    The canister
          is beside him on the passenger seat.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          The crowd falls silent, all eyes turning upward, watching the
          helicopter recede into the clouds.
          
                                          117.
          
          
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          The canister BEEPS on the seat beside the Camerlengo -- still a
          few minutes left on its timer, but the urgently flashing red power
          light can't be considered a good sign.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at it.
          
          Crosses himself.
          
          Raises the crucifix from around his neck and brushes it against
          his lips.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          All eyes are upturned, all voices have fallen still, watching as
          the helicopter's anti-collision lights disappear into the clouded
          night sky.
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY       NIGHT
          
          High above the square, the helicopter still climbs, rotating in
          circles.
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON the canister as the red light flashes even faster, and a
          shrill BEEPING fills the cockpit.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          In the crowd, faces turn, PEOPLE point.        There's something in
          the sky above them.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria see it too -- a faint white speck, far up in
          the sky.    This is the explosion?
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY       NIGHT
          
          No, the faint white speck is a billowing parachute    -- and the
          
          Camerlengo dangles at the end of it.
          
          ABOVE HIM,
          
          the helicopter continues to climb, far up into the night.
          
          INT     HELICOPTER       NIGHT
          
          And in the canister, the BEEPING sound becomes continuous and the
          light winks out altogether.
          
                                          118.
          
          
          
          The shimmering bead of anti-matter falls out of suspension and
          drops, slowly, toward the bottom of the canister, it barely
          touches the surface --
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY         NIGHT
          
           -- and the helicopter explodes in a blinding pinpoint of white
          light.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          Up in the sky over St. Peter's Square, the pinpoint of light is
          tiny at first, then it shoots out to either side in a searing
          white line, then the white line balloons out on either side,
          expanding into a gigantic ball of hot white light.
          
          And then the sound hits.
          
          THIS is the explosion, and it is so much more ferocious than we
          could have imagined.
          
          The entire image is bleached white, with only the faint outlines
          of people visible within it.
          
          And then concussive force of the blast hits, like heat waves,
          rippling everything in its way.    SCREAMING and panic.
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY         NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo, clinging to the parachute, is buffeted wildly,
          spun over and over, tangling him in his cords, which makes him
          fall faster.
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          The second wave of the blast comes, and this one's ten times as
          powerful as the first.
          
          Everything standing is flattened -- PEOPLE, camera trucks, the
          fountain in the middle of the square collapses in a shower of
          marble and water.
          
          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA         NIGHT
          
          Ceiling tiles fall and SMASH on the floor inside St. Peter's,
          statues topple.
          
          EXT     IN THE SKY         NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo falls, unconscious now, tumbling over and over,
          dropping too fast. He SLAMS off an angled rooftop, headed for the
          ground.
          
                                           119.
          
          
          
          EXT       ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
          In the square, Langdon and Vittoria dodge falling debris.
          Vittoria loses her footing as a chunk of plaster CRUNCHES off a
          building, plummeting toward her.
          
          Langdon pulls her to safety as the plaster PULVERIZES itself in
          the square.
          
          EXT      IN THE SKY       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo CRUNCHES off the side of another building and
          drifts downward, fast, toward the crowd in St. Peter's.
          
          His unconscious form SMASHES through a dozen people before SLAMMING
          to the ground at one edge of the square.
          
          AND IN THE SKY ABOVE,
          
          the blast suddenly turns inward on itself, the heat and light and
          sound all seeming to suck back up into a perfect horizontal line,
          which then collapses in from the sides, until once again it is
          just a speck of white hot light --
          
           -- that disappears into the night.
          
          EXT      ST.    PETER'S SQUARE          NIGHT
          
          The only sound that remains in the square is a soft night wind.
          
          The wounded pick themselves up off the ground.
          
          The crowd, realizing the blast is over, turns its attention to the
          body of the Camerlengo, on the far side of the square.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria try to make their way toward him, but the
          crowd surges past them, and we soar over the heads of the crowd,
          wanting to get there first, wanting to be the first ones to see
          
          --- his eyes open. He's alive.
          
          WIDE ON THE SQUARE AS
          
          a great CHEER rises up from the crowd.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          INT      SISTINE CHAPEL          NIGHT
          
          The CHEERS from outside are clearly audible in the Sistine Chapel,
          where the doors have been thrown open and they have gotten the
          news.    Jubilation reigns.
          
          A SWISS GUARDSMAN runs in, finds Cardinal Mortati.
          
                                          120.
          
          
          
                                          SWISS GUARDSMAN
                            Signore Mortati, he is alive!              The
                            Camerlengo is alive!
          
                                                 MORTATI
                            Praise God.
          
          But he looks around him -- the Cardinals have split into small
          groups, they're discussing something with great animation amongst
          themselves.
          
          Mortati watches, doesn't like what he's seeing.
          
                                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT     OFFICE OF THE SWISS GUARD                NIGHT
          
          Langdon and Vittoria, on a bench in the office of the Swiss Guard,
          are having superficial wounds treated.    The buzz in the office is
          intense, just as excited as in the square and the Sistine Chapel.
          
          Langdon looks over at Vittoria.
          
                                                 LANGDON
                            Are you okay?
          
          She looks back at him, nods. Smiles. He reaches over, interlaces
          his fingers with hers, and takes her hand.
          
                                                 LANGDON    (cont'd)
                            Thank God.
          
          She smiles, turns his hand, noticing the glass on his wristwatch
          is broken.    He notices, seems distressed.
          
                                          VITTORIA
                            Do we have time for that story now?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            Do I have someone to tell it to?
          
          She smiles and kisses the back of his hand          -- yes.        A ROAR
          comes from outside and we see --
          
          EXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT
          
           -- the crowd in St. Peter's Square, in rapture. There is SINGING,
          there's CHANTING of the Camerlengo's name.    It's exactly
          midnight.
          
                                      121.
          
          
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
          In the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati is in hushed, urgent
          conversation with a group of seven or eight Cardinals.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Signores... you are no doubt aware
                           that by Holy Law the man is ineligible
                           for election to the papacy.    He is
                           not a cardinal, he is a priest, a
                           chamberlain.    And there is the
                           matter of his inadequate age.    I'm
                           sorry, the protocols of conclave are
                           not subject to modification.    I will
                           not call a ballot on this matter.
          
          The African Cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up.
          
                                         AFRICAN CARDINAL
                           But Signore, you would not call the
                           ballot.    Surely you remember -- you
                           gave up your post as Great Elector.
          
          Mortati looks at him.    Boxed into a corner.
          
          Outside, the crowd in St. Peter's can be heard, singing joyously.
          
          A SECOND CARDINAL steps forward.
          
                                         SECOND CARDINAL
                           They are singing in St. Peter's
                           Square!   What happened here tonight
                           transcends our laws!
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Does it?    Is it God's will that we
                           abandon reason and give ourselves over
                           to frenzy?   Discard the rules of the
                           church?
          
          A THIRD CARDINAL now, a peacemaker:
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL
                           Perhaps they need not be discarded.
          
          They all look at him.
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL   (cont'd)
                           I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici
                           Eligendo, Numero 63.
          
          Most of the Cardinals look puzzled -- but Mortati's face darkens.
          
                                      122.
          
          
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL (cont'd)
                           Balloting is not the only method by
                           which a Pope can be elected.    There
                           is another, more divine method.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           "Acclimation by Adoration."
          
                                             THIRD CARDINAL
                           Si, signore!
          
          The Second Cardinal sparks to this idea.
          
                                         SECOND CARDINAL
                           Of course!
                                (answering those around
                                 him who look confused)
                           Election by Adoration occurs when
                           all the cardinals, as if by
                           inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
                           freely and spontaneously,
                           unanimously and aloud, proclaim one
                           individual's name.
          
                                         THIRD CARDINAL
                           And the law states that Adoration
                           supersedes all other eligibility
                           requirements.    The candidate need
                           only be an ordained member of the
                           clergy.
                                (DRAMATICALLY)
                           BUT!
                                (they listen)
                           He must be present in the Sistine
                           Chapel at the moment of election.
          
          Many cries now of "Bring the Camerlengo to us!"
          
          Mortati looks deeply troubled.
          
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          
          
          INT     ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT
          
          Bandaged now, Langdon and Vittoria are ushered into Rocher's
          office by a Swiss Guardsman.
          
                                         SWISS GUARDSMAN
                           Please wait here while we arrange your
                           transportation.    May I get you
                           anything?
          
                                        123.
          
          
          
          They shake their heads, no thanks.        Settle into chairs to the
          side of Rocher's desk.
          
          They look uncomfortable   -- it's weird to be in a dead man's
          office.
          
          Vittoria looks at his desk.     Thinks of something.
          
          She gets up and goes to it, running her hand lightly over it.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           What are you doing?
          
                                         VITTORIA
                           Leonardo's journals.          I want them
                           back.
          
          She feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline
          of the inlaid panel where Rocher hid the journals.    She tries
          prying it open, but that doesn't work, she tries pushing down on
          the front of it --
          
           -- and the panel slowly rotates open.    The journals, which were
          laid on top of the television monitor, slide out and onto the
          desk.
          
          Vittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again
          when --
          
                                               LANGDON
                           Wait a minute.
          
          He looks down at the monitor.        Thinking.
          
          At its odd, key-shaped on/off switch.
          
          He pulls something from his pocket      -- the key Rocher gave him,
          just as he died.
          
          IN LANGDON'S MIND,
          
          he sees Rocher's face, looking up at him, dying:
          
                                               ROCHER
                           For safety.
          
          BACK IN THE OFFICE,
          
          Langdon looks at the key, and its odd shape.    Looks down at the
          monitor, the same odd shape where its switch should be.
          
                                       124.
          
          
          
          IN LANGDON'S MIND,
          
          they're back in the Pope's office, but Rocher is alive, and saying
          words he said earlier:
          
                                          ROCHER
                            The Holy Father was subject to
                            seizures... but he took steps.
          
          BACK IN THE OFFICE,
          
          Rocher's voice continues over, but Langdon mouths the words as he
          remembers them:
          
                                          ROCHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                            "MADE SURE HE WAS WATCHED."
          
          IN LANGDON'S MIND,
          
          Rocher is back in the office again, finishing his sentence:
          
                                              ROCHER
                            For safety.
          
          IN ROCHER'S OFFICE,
          
          Langdon holds the key up, repeating those last words:
          
                                              LANGDON
                            For safety.
          
          He lowers the key to the monitor, extending it toward the keyhole
          
          -- and it's a perfect fit.      He twists it.
          
          And with a ZZZZT of power, the monitor winks to life.   An image
          comes into focus.
          
                                              VITTORIA
                            Where's that?
          
                                          LANGDON
                            That...is the papal office.
          
          On the monitor,
          
          they are indeed looking at an image of the Pope's office.    There
          are two dead bodies on the floor, covered with sheets, and VATICAN
          POLICE are photographing everything.    Must be live.
          
          IN ROCHER'S OFFICE,
          
          Langdon's figuring it out.
          
                                      125.
          
          
          
                                          LANGDON
                            The Pope spent a lot of time in
                            contemplation, alone.    If he was
                            worried about seizures, he must have
                            asked Rocher to install a camera
                            without telling anyone.    To keep an
                            eye on him.    For safety.    And
                            maybe --
          
          He reaches down to the screen, toward a touch panel at the bottom.
          
          You don't have to be a symbologist to understand these symbols-
          play, pause, fast forward.
          
          And rewind.   Langdon touches it.
          
          ON THE MONITOR,
          
          the image ZIPS backwards, rapidly, to the shooting, and the all
          the way back to when Rocher and the Camerlengo were alone
          together. Rocher stands just behind him, the Camerlengo still
          kneels before the fireplace.
          
          As the image starts to play forward, in real time, we go in close
          on the monitor and come out --
          
          INT     POPE'S OFFICE       NIGHT
          
          -- in the papal office, to watch the scene in person.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            The scientist kept journals?      So?
          
                                          ROCHER
                            You figure prominently in them.
          
          The Camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames, stirring the
          embers with a poker.
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                            Really.
          
                                          ROCHER
                            Leonardo wasn't just a physicist, he
                            was a Catholic priest.    Deeply
                            conflicted about the implications of
                            his work and in need of spiritual
                            guidance.    About a month ago, he
                            requested an audience with the Pope.
                            But you'd know that, because you
                            granted the audience, and were present
                            during it.
          
          The Camerlengo twists the poker in the fire.     Speaks softly.
          
                                      126.
          
          
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           The fool thought he had duplicated the
                           moment of creation.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           And the Holy Father urged him to go
                           public.    His Holiness thought the
                           discovery might actually prove the
                           existence of a divine power -- begin
                           to bridge the gap between religion and
                           science.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Science.    The new God.    Ignore the
                           weapons and chaos and madness.
          
          The Camerlengo looks up at him, and his expression is different
          than we've ever seen it.    Contemptuous.    Angry.    Violent.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO (cont'd)
                           His work was not religious, it was
                           sacrilegious!
          
                                         ROCHER
                           But you saw the Pope's position as a
                           softening of church law.    An old
                           man's weakness.    Your father's
                           weakness.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           He raised me to protect the church.
                           Even from within.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           So you brought an old enemy back from
                           the dead to frighten people.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           Nothing unites hearts like the
                           presence of evil.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           It didn't work, Father.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           It isn't finished.
          
                                         ROCHER
                           I've informed Father Simeon of what I
                           learned and he'll get word to the
                           Cardinals the moment conclave opens.
          
          The Camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment   --
          
                                      127.
          
          
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            I was planning on doing this alone.
          
           -- and then removes the poker from the fire. But it isn't a
          poker, it's a long-handled brand, with a cross of some kind at the
          end.
          
          Rocher pulls his gun, holds it at his side.
          
                                             ROCHER
                            Put that down.
          
          The Camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand.
          
                                          CAMERLENGO
                            But perhaps it's better that you're
                            here.
          
                                          ROCHER
                                 (raising the gun)
                            Put it down!
          
          But the Camerlengo RAMS the red-hot brand into the exposed flesh
          of his bare chest.    His skin SIZZLES and smokes, Rocher SHOUTS,
          the Camerlengo SCREAMS in agony, and we know the rest --
          
           -- the door bursts open, Swiss Guard pour in, Rocher is shot,
          Father Simeon races toward the Camerlengo --
          
                                             FR. SIMEON
                            You bastard!       You sanctimonious-
          
           -- and the Camerlengo rolls over, pointing one long finger at
          Father Simeon and CRYING OUT:
          
                                             CAMERLENGO
                            ILLUMINATUS!
          
          As we saw before, Lt. Chartrand FIRES THREE TIMES, killing Father
          Simeon in his tracks, we pull back, the image turns to --
          
          INT      ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT
          
           -- video again, and as we complete the move out from the monitor,
          we see it isn't Langdon and Vittoria watching the image this time --
          
          --- but Cardinal Mortati, flanked by two other red-robed Cardinals
          and a half-dozen Swiss Guardsman.
          
          Langdon and Vittoria stand to one side as Mortati turns and looks
          at them.    Suddenly, he seems very, very old.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
                                      128.
          
          
          
          INT     GRAND STAIRCASE       NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo, escorted by two Swiss Guardsman, descends the
          Royal Staircase that leads to the Sistine Chapel.
          
          Though he is injured and limping, he radiates confidence, even
          benevolence, a man certain this is the greatest day of his life.
          
          He approaches the chapel doors, speaks to the Swiss Guard posted
          there as he approaches.
          
                                         CAMERLENGO
                           I have been summoned by the College of
                           Cardinals.
          
          Oh, they know all about it.    They lift their swords, the doors
          sweep open, the Camerlengo strides boldly across the threshold --
          
          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT
          
           -- and stops, right there, the look of imminent ascendancy frozen
          on his face.
          
          The Cardinals are looking at him, all right, but not in joy, not
          in wonder, not for leadership.    One hundred sixty-one faces are
          turned toward his, with an expression of ---
          
          -- utter condemnation.
          
          He stands there for a moment, searching their faces, trying to
          figure out what could possibly have happened.
          
          But it doesn't matter.
          
          They know.   And he knows they know.
          
          He takes two steps backwards, almost involuntarily.
          
          Starts to teeter, balances himself in the doorway.
          
          Then straightens himself, smoothes his cassock.
          
          And turns and walks away, back up the staircase.
          
          Two Swiss Guard move to go after him, quickly, but Cardinal
          Mortati gestures to them.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Gently.    But within our walls.
          
          The Swiss Guard follow the Camerlengo up the staircase.
          
                                                                        CUT TO:

          INT      ST.   PETER'S BASILICA      NIGHT
          
          The Camerlengo comes out of a doorway and into St. Peter's
          Basilica.    He heads for the main doors --
          
           -- just as HALF A DOZEN SWISS GUARD step in from outside,
          blocking his way.    Some MURMUR softly into their radios.
          
          He stops, turns around to come back the way he came ---
          
           -- but TWO SWISS GUARD appear in that doorway, also with radios.
          
          He turns again, no way to go but toward the front of the Basilica.
          
          He sees the candlelit balustrade near the front, the one that
          leads to the grottoes and the Necropolis.    He picks up his pace.
          
          The Swiss Guard follow, at a slight distance.
          
          The Camerlengo reaches the spiral staircase and stops, looking
          down, seeing the oil lamp he kicked over earlier.
          
          He thinks.     He picks up a fresh lamp, holds it to his face    --
          
           -- and blows out its flame with a soft PUFF.
          
          ACROSS THE BASILICA,
          
          we're with the Swiss Guard as they walk slowly toward him.
          
          But they hear a CRY from ahead, he's gone down the stairs a short
          distance, and they can hear the sound of liquid SLOSHING.
          
          They break into a run as they realize what he's about to do,
          they're twenty feet away, then ten, then just close enough to see
          the Camerlengo as he --
          
           -- SMASHES a burning oil lamp at his feet.     The flames leap
          onto his oil-soaked clothes and --
          
           -- HE IGNITES IN A PILLAR OF WHITE FLAME.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON a bundle of one hundred sixty-one slips of paper, pierced
          by a needle and strung together.
          
          They're tossed into the fireplace in the Sistine Chapel, where
          they too burst into flame.
          
          We rise up again, ahead of the smoke this time, all the way up to      --

          still gathered, waiting for some word as the sun rises on the
          horizon. And this time, the smoke that billows from the chimney    --
          
          -- is white.
          
          There is a new pope.    The crowd ROARS its approval, BELLS begin

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT     PAPAL APARTMENT DAY
          
          Inside the papal apartments, Robert Langdon sits stiffly on a
          straight-backed chair in a hallway.    Couldn't look more
          uncomfortable if he tried.
          
          A Swiss Guardsman stands on either side of him.
          
          The door to his right suddenly opens, another Guardsman nods to
          him, and Langdon gets to his feet, straightening his jacket.
          
          INT     OFFICE OF THE POPE DAY
          
          Langdon is shown into the office, where a robed figure is being
          dressed by two VATICAN ATTENDANTS -- the clothes he dons are
          unmistakably papal vestments.    The figure, his back to us,
          gestures to a nearby table.
          
          One of the Swiss Guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an
          envelope, hands it to Langdon.
          
                                         SWISS GUARDSMAN
                           A token of thanks from His Holiness.
          
          Langdon, puzzled, opens the envelope and lets the contents fall
          into his hand.
          
          It's a thin volume, but a familiar one -- the only surviving copy
          of Galileo's Diagramma.    Langdon nearly GASPS.
          
          The figure in the papal robes turn around.       It is, of course,
          Cardinal Mortati.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           This should help you complete your
                           scholarly work, Professor.
          
          Langdon is too stunned to speak,
          
                                         MORTATI   (cont'd)
                           I ask only that in your last will and
                           testament you ensure it finds its way
                           home.
          
                                           LANGDON
                           I   -- yes, I   -- of course.
          
                                       132.
          
          
          
          Mortati takes a few steps forward, studying Langdon,
          
                                         MORTATI
                           When you write of us -- and you will
                           write of us -- may I ask one thing?
          
          Langdon looks at him questioningly.
          
                                              MORTATI   (cont'd)
                           Do so gently?
          
                                              LANGDON
                           I'll try.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           Religion is flawed, Mr. Langdon, but
                           only because man is flawed.
                           Including this one.
          
          He touches his chest lightly.
          
          The Aides now pick up the miter, the spade-shaped papal hat.   He
          stands still while they place it on his head, completing his
          attire.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           I hear you've chosen the name Luke.
                           There have been Marks and Johns, but
                           never a Luke.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           It's said he was a doctor.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           Is that a message?    Science and
                           faith all in one?
          
                                         MORTATI
                           The world is in need of both.
                           Science can heal, or science can kill.
                           It depends on the soul of the man
                           using the science.
          
          Langdon looks at him.   Likes the sound of that.
          
                                         LANGDON
                           You'll lead wisely.
          
                                         MORTATI
                           I'm an old man.    I'll lead briefly,
          
          Mortati comes closer to Langdon, raises his right hand, and makes
          a gentle sign of the cross over him, murmuring softly.
          
                                      133.
          
          
          
                                         MORTATI (cont'd)
                           Thanks be to God, for sending someone
                           to protect His church.
          
                                        LANGDON
                           I -- don't believe He sent me,
                           Father.
          
                                             MORTATI
                           Oh, my son...
          
          He smiles.
          
                                         MORTATI (cont'd)
                           Of course He did.
          
          He turns, and his Aides part the billowing silk curtains that lead
          to the papal balcony.
          
          We move forward with him as he steps out over St. Peter's Square
          and a great ROAR rises up from below.
          
          Cardinal Mortati, Pope Luke I, holds his arms out to his sides, an
          embrace to take in the world --
          
           -- and behind him, hidden in the shadows of the papal apartment,
          just behind the billowing curtains, Robert Langdon folds his hand
          in front of him --
          
          -- and bows his head.

    The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for
    their shows. Cabs line the streets.

    SIDE ALLEY

    A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a
    screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and
    rushes to the side entrance of a theater.

    In the background we see that the title of the play,
    "Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...

    The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the
    audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. .

    Stagehands are moving stage lights as--

    A STAGE MANAGER

    takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the
    audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella
    in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other.

    He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief
    floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit
    hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly
    hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in
    the background.

    The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the
    audience dies down.

    single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see
    the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V).

    "Prologue" regards his audience for a   beat before:

                              PROLOGUE
                Soul of the Age!
                The applause, delight, the wonder of
                our stage!
                Our Shakespeare, rise...
                       (beat, repeating)
                Our Shakespeare... For he is all of
                ours, is he not? The most performed
                playwright of all time! The author of
                37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several
                epic poems that are collectively known
                as the ultimate expressions of
                humanity in the English language. And
                yet... And yet...
                       (beat)
                Not a single manuscript of any kind
                has ever been found written in
                Shakespeare's own hand. In four
                hundred years, not one document-- be
                it poem, play, diary or even a simple
                letter.
                       (beat)
                He was born the son of a glove-maker,
                and at some unknown time, armed with
                but an elementary school education, he
                went to London where, the story goes,
                he became an actor and eventually a
                playwright.

    OFF STAGE

    A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a
    flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER.

    Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a
    stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.

    ON STAGE

    "Prologue" opens his umbrella.

                             PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
                He died at the age of 56, and was
                survived by his wife and two daughters
                who were, like Shakespeare's own
                father, irrefutably illiterate.

                                                              2
                                                 pg. 3


OFF STAGE

In the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to
RAIN.

                         PROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
            His will famously left his second best
            bed to his widow. But it made no
            mention of a single book or
            manuscript.

The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears
in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a
prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of
Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords.

ON STAGE

"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.

                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
            Is it possible Shakespeare owned no
            books at his death because... he could
            not read? That he wrote no letters
            because he, like his father before him
            and his children after him, could not
            write?
                   (lets that sink in, then)
            Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost;
            his biography made not by history...
            but by conjecture. His story not
            written with facts, but with...
            imagination.

The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the
camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END....

                         PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
                   (more energetic)
            So! Let me offer you a different
            story. A darker story... Of quills
            and swords. Of power and betrayal.
            Of a stage conquered, and a throne
            lost!

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of
RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then,
trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben
Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of
houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We
are:




                                                          3
                                                      pg. 4


6    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT                             6

     Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street
     toward a large circular theater.

     He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--


7    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                                 7

     --and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and
     desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards
     the stage as--


8    EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8

     About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They
     are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.

                            POLE
               Break it down!

     And several of the guards charge the door with their
     pikes, HITTING it hard.

                            POLE (CONT'D)
               Again!


9    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            9

     Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view
     just as--


10   EXT/INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                    10

     --the guards SMASH the door open.    Pole is the first
     in.

                             POLE
               Jonson!   Jonson!!    Show yourself!

     The soldiers immediately spread out into different
     parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--

     JONSON

     has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat
     trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of
     props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners,
     shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes
     when he sees--

                                                               4
                                                pg. 5


THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGE'S FLOORBOARDS

--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out, Pole
amongst them.

                          POLE (CONT'D)
            Out with you! Jonson! We'll smoke
            you out like a rat if we have to!
                   (beat)
            Jonson?! Jonson!!

Nothing.    A beat, then--

                         POLE (CONT'D)
                   (to a soldier)
            Torch it.

The soldier hesitates.

                          POLE (CONT'D)
            Torch it!   All of you!

The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the
galleries, the columns as--

JONSON

GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal
box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.

He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then
places the bound manuscripts in their place, then
closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--

FLAMES

--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the
front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the
seating galleries... the columns...

A TRAP DOOR

opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in
his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three
soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.

Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of
the stage-- but then runs smack into four other
soldiers!

Ballocks!

Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins
wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.

                                                          5
                                                      pg. 6


11   EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                            11

     Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through
     the door, Pole following.

     A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the
     theater burn. The guards have to push their way
     through them.

     INSERT

     The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's
     stage, and--

     BACK TO SCENE

     -- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn
     and see:

     THE THEATER

     Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.


12   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAWN                             12

     A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes
     its way towards the Tower Of London.


13   INT. TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN      13

     Jonson is thrown into a chair, a guard on either side
     of him. It's dark-- the only light coming from a few
     torches in the walls, and a large fire pit at the far
     side of the room.

     An INTERROGATOR (30's) faces him.   Dressed all in
     black, he is wispy thin.

                            INTERROGATOR
               You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright?
               Son of William Jonson, glass-blower,
               son of James Jonson brick-layer?

     Jonson nods.

                            INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
               And have you ever been arrested
               before, Mr. Jonson?

                            JONSON
               I'm a writer, aren't I?   Of course
               I've bloody well been--

                                                              6
                                                     pg. 7


And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force--
hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground.
His nose starts to bleed.

As the Guards pull him up, the Interrogator looks
across the room-- there is someone else there, a
FIGURE, watching, but cloaked in the darkness.

Jonson notices the figure as well.      We hear a voice
from the darkness.

                          FIGURE
             Ask him about the plays.

                            JONSON
                      (to the Interrogator)
             Plays?
                    (to the Figure)
             Which would you prefer, my lord? A
             pastoral? An historical? An
             historical-pastoral, or an hysterical
             historical pastoral--

And SMACK!    He's hit by the guards again.   He SPITS out
a tooth.

                          INTERROGATOR
             We are not interested in your plays,
             Jonson. We are interested in the
             plays given to you by Edward de Vere,
             Earl of Oxford.

Jonson stares at him a beat, and then looks into the
darkness.

                          JONSON
             I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I
             know whereof you speak. I have had
             the honor of meeting his lordship--

And SMACK--

                                              FLASH CUT TO:

FACES

laughing. Not in this room, somewhere else. Somewhere
outside. Before we really understand what we are
seeing we are:

BACK IN THE CELL

Jonson blinks, trying to stay conscious.      His mouth is
ripped, bleeding. So is his nose.

                                                              7
                                                       pg. 8


     The skin has broken on his forehead.     The Interrogator
     leans into the bloody Jonson.

                               INTERROGATOR
                  Where are the plays?

     Before Jonson even has a chance to answer-- SMACK!

                                                        CUT TO:

     MORE FACES

     Laughing.    We are:


14   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  14

     And it is nine years earlier. The faces come from an
     audience watching a play. They find the performance
     hysterical.


15   EXT. ROSE THEATER/BANKSIDE LONDON - CONTINUOUS               15

     The Rose towers above the nearby buildings "Bankside"
     (the part of London that houses the theaters,
     whorehouses, etc.).

     The Rose towers above the nearby buildings "Bankside"
     (the part of London that houses the theaters,
     whorehouses, etc.).

                              SOUTHAMPTON (O.S.)
                  Well?

     TWO MEN

     walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the
     Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes
     have seen better days.

     His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON
     (22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and
     extremely enthusiastic.

                               SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                  Wonderful, isn't it?

                               OXFORD
                         (frowning slightly)
                  Well, it's certainly... big.




                                                                  8
                                                  pg. 9


                       SOUTHAMPTON
          I promise you, Edward, you've seen
          nothing like it before! Nothing!

                       OXFORD
          Bricklayers and whores watching
          Aristophones?   You're quite right,
          Henry, not only have I never witnessed
          it, I'm not sure I care to.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
                 (teasing)
          You're an elitist, you know that,
          Edward?

Oxford pauses at the entrance.

                       OXFORD
          There won't be puppets, will there?

Southampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER,
who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay
outside) inside.

                        USHER
          My lords...


INT. THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

The usher takes them up a flight of stairs.    Oxford
observes everything as they walk.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          The stage-craft is quite spectacular.
          Far more elaborate than anything I've
          seen at court. I've witnessed be-
          headings that god as my witness look
          as real as at the Tower, cannons fired
          in battle...

They come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has
a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much
like a match-stick girl.

                        SELLING-MAID
          Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord?

Southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up
another flight of stairs.




                                                          9
                                                   pg. 10


                        SOUTHAMPTON
           ...and last week, they had some sort
           of a device to hoist cherubs into the
           air and fly over the entire audience!

                        OXFORD
           An apò mekhanes theós. Deus ex
           machina. Machine of the Gods.

And as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches
glimpses of the stage and performance through the
rafters and over the heads of the attending audience.

                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
           Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes
           into a situation from which they
           couldn't write their way out--

Oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost
despite himself.

                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
           --Out came the apò mekhanes theós...
           As when Hippolytus is saved by
           Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens...
           Always good for an apò mekhanes theós
           was Euripides

Oxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton.

They come to the third floor and enter the box seating
area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real
look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and
sees-

FROM OXFORD'S POV

Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids
SELLING food-- the actors ACTING...

It's alive.   Magical.

BACK TO OXFORD

Oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it.

ON-STAGE

The actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner.
He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard
of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly.

Another actor SPENCER (30) plays "FASTIDIOUS"; a
pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman.

                                                            10
                                                    pg. 11


He wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage
is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays
"Sogliardo"

                         SHAKESPEARE
            And whither were you riding now,
            signior?

                         "FASTIDIOUS"
            Who, I? What a silly jest's that!
            Whither should I ride but to the
            court?

                         SHAKESPEARE
            O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more;
            your hot-house, your pig-house, or
            your whore-house!

The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks
below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings".
He smiles seductively. She smiles back.

BACKSTAGE

Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the
performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking
the lines with the actors.

IN THE RAISED SEATING

A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an
air of judgement. They are: Christopher "Kit" MARLOWE
(32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the
boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard
drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered
a bit of a hack by his colleagues.

They are called the "Mermaid's Wits" because they
frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern.

                         NASHE
                   (takes a swig of ale)
            His second play, and almost a full
            house.
                   (burps)
            He's got a wit, does Jonson.

                         MARLOWE
            That might be so, but like a grain of
            wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you
            shall seek all day ere you find it,
            and when you have it, it's not worth
            the search!


                                                             11
                                                 pg. 12


The others smile as a WOMAN passes.

                         WOMAN
          Ale!   Ale!!

                       DEKKER
          Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will
          you? Henslowe still owes me for
          "Shoemaker's Holiday".

                       MARLOWE
                 (retrieving coins)
          That would be because no one saw
          "Shoemaker's Holiday".

                         DEKKER
          Ale here!

Marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as--

                       NASHE
          Kit... Isn't that one of your
          unrequited loves in the box over
          there?

Marlowe glances across the theater and spots
Southampton siting next to Oxford.

                       MARLOWE
                 (frowns)
          But with whom? Tell me not he prefers
          the company of such old grey men as
          that!

Nashe squints.

                       NASHE
          I think-- yes, by the beard, that's
          the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker
          used to play for him. Had his own
          acting troupe for private Court
          performances and the like.

                       DEKKER
          I wonder if he needs any material?

                       MARLOWE
          Certainly not any of yours.

                       NASHE
          No, no-- that was years ago. Had a
          falling out with the Queen, I heard.
          He's more of a recluse than a patron
          these days.

                                                          12

ON STAGE

Shakespeare points to "Fastidious".

                          SHAKESPEARE
             Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a
             gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the
             earth; man, he looks like a fresh
             salmon kept in a tub!

Shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place.
The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in
laughter.

                          SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
             He sleeps with a musk-cat every night,
             and walks all day hang'd in perfumed
             chains for penance.

                           A GROUNDLING
             Oi!   So that's what I been smelling!

More groundlings laugh.     Interestingly--

NOBLEMEN

in the box seats do not.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to
the groundlings.

                          SHAKESPEARE
             He has his skin tann'd in civet, to
             make his complexion strong, and the
             sweetness of his youth lasting in the
             sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly,
             the poor man's brain is lighter than
             his feather...

As the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see:

A NOBLEMAN

with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the
theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him
as he goes.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare smiles triumphantly.



                                                              13
                                                   pg. 14


                         SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
            He is a good and empty puff, but he
            loves you well, signior. I wish you
            well with him.

OXFORD

Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass
by.

BACKSTAGE

Later in the play...

Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig
from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his
performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson,
and grabs him.

                        SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
            Jonson! Wonderful dialogue!
            Wonderful. I hope your next--

                          HENSLOWE (O.C.)
            Will!   Will Shakespeare!

Shakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE
(50'S) heading his way.

                         HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
            That's not ale in that goblet is it?

Shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back.

                         SHAKESPEARE
            Ale? Me? Drink during a performance?
            I am a professional sir!
                   (burps)
            A complete and--

He is interrupted by SCREAMS.    Not from actors on
stage, but by the audience.

IN THE THEATER

Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard
STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as
quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry
CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13).

SIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

--jumps on stage.


                                                            14
                                                    pg. 15


                        POLE
           This play has been declared seditious
           and illegal by Lord William Cecil!

The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil.

                        POLE (CONT'D)
           All are herewith ordered to disperse
           immediately!

                        A GROUNDLING
           Why don't you disperse William Cecil's
           arse!

                        POLE
           Arrest that man!

IN OXFORD'S BOX

                          SOUTHAMPTON
           Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's
           then?

He gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in
the real drama below as everyone hurries from the
theater.

                          SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
           Edward?

Oxford turns to him, distracted, and nods.

ON STAGE

Jonson pushes his way on stage.

                        JONSON
                  (to Pole)
           Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy
           for god's sake! There's nothing
           seditious about--

                        POLE
           Oi, is that right, is it?    And you
           know this because?

                        JONSON
           Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And-
           -

                        POLE
           Arrest him as well!

Jonson is grabbed by guards.

                                                             15
                                                       pg. 16


17   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        17

     Jonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind
     him.

                             JONSON
                      (to the door)
               A pox on you!
                      (beat)
               And your carbuncled father!

     Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen
     or so other prisoners.

                            ESSEX (O.S.)
               People taxed to the point of
               starvation, Spain running the New
               World, open revolt in Ireland,
               Catholic plots everywhere you turn...

                                                        CUT TO:


18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18

     Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against
     Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will
     learn, very ambitious.

                            ESSEX
               ...and how do the Cecils spend their
               time and energy? Shutting a theater!
               A theater, for god's sake? It's
               madness! No wonder the mob hates them
               so!

     The court is inside, and slightly different from
     today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat
     like racquet-ball.

     Oxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot,
     but it goes--

                              OXFORD
               Out!

     Essex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton
     prepares to serve.

                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
                      (to Southampton)
               Henry, how many people were at that
               play?


                                                                  16
                                                     pg. 17


     Southampton pauses before serving.

                           SOUTHAMPTON
               Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand,
               maybe more.

     Southampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated
     rally begins.

                            OXFORD
               And how many performances are there of
               a play like that?

                            SOUTHAMPTON
               Five or six I suppose.

     He HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it.

                             ESSEX
               By the--!

                            OXFORD
                      (to Essex)
               So! Ten thousand souls. All
               listening to the writings of one man--
               the ideas of one man. That's power,
               Robert. And if there is one thing the
               Cecils understand, it's power.

                            ESSEX
                      (snorts)
               And when did words ever win a kingdom?
               I think I'll keep my sword, thank you
               very much.

     Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naiveté.


19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19

     Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis
     clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two
     valets.

                            ESSEX
                      (to the valets)
               Leave us.
                      (they exit)
               Henry... Some of my men have...
               intercepted... some of William Cecil's
               recent correspondence with King James
               of Scotland...



                                                               17
                                                 pg. 18


Southampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is
serious.

                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
          Cecil's all but promising him the
          throne...

                        SOUTHAMPTON
          To James?   Elizabeth would never agree
          to-

                       ESSEX
          Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her
          old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even
          recognize me. And yet, still she
          refuses to name an heir.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne?

                       ESSEX
          You are not in the Privy Council.
          Elizabeth does everything the Cecils
          wish of her. Everything!

BEHIND THEM

Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He
instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He
listens as:

WIDER

                        ESSEX (CONT'D)
          Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his
          throne, Cecil will have more influence
          in the next reign than he does in this
          one. And after William Cecil, his
          hunch-backed son will take his
          place...
                 (careful)
          That is why we must do everything in
          our power to ensure that the right man
          succeeds her.
                 (beat)
          A man deserving of the Tudor crown.

Southampton stiffens at that last phrase.

                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
          I ask you for the support of you and
          your men, Henry.... if it comes to a
          fight.


                                                          18
                                                       pg. 19


     Southampton looks at Essex hard.

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                You know you need not ask. I stand
                with you, as I always have.

     Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something
     shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:

     WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING

     Nothing.   He is gone.

     BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX

     They exchange a slightly worried look.

                                                         CUT TO:


20   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                         20

     Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
     elaborate building that serves as Essex's London
     residence.

                             OXFORD
                Essex played rather poorly, didn't he?

     Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out
     to him, and touches his shoulder.

                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                       (warning)
                Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals.

     Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then--

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                       (re: his discussion with
                        Essex)
                You heard?

     Oxford nods.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                Always concerned for me, aren't you
                Edward?

     They keep walking towards Southampton's men.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                And what would you have me do?


                                                                   19
                                                  pg. 20


                       OXFORD
          I would have you deny him.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          The son of the Queen?

                       OXFORD
          That is rumor only, Henry--

They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out
of earshot.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Rumor? My god, all you have to do is
          look at Essex to see the Queen's
          reflection. Everyone thinks he's her
          son, everyone! And I for one would
          rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though
          he may be, than a Scotsman!

                        OXFORD
          I desire nothing more than to see the
          next king be the rightful king. But
          what Essex contemplates will surely
          lead to Civil War.
                 (beat)
          No. If this is to be done, it must be
          done carefully, skillfully.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you
          from her presence for the last twenty
          years because of your "skill" at Court
          politics.

And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said
that.

                       OXFORD
          I only have your interests in mind,
          Henry. For as you so rightly point
          out, my interests are already lost.

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          I know. Forgive me. You know how I
          feel about you. You have been a great
          friend to me ever since my father
          died. I promise you that I will do
          nothing rash without consulting you
          first.

Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for
his horse.

                            OXFORD
               Henry! Will you do me one thing more?
               Deliver a gift for me? A rather...
               elaborate gift?


21   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET                                  21

     The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor
     house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in
     design.

     It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area
     which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting
     the noblemen off for a week-end get away.


22   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK                       22

     Most of England's nobility is assembled in small
     groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some
     music, no life. Quite Puritan.

     Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere
     to be seen.

     A HUNCH-BACKED MAN

     --makes his way through the room, causing conversations
     to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the
     nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This
     is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's).

     He pauses near Southampton.

                              SOUTHAMPTON
               Sir Robert.

                            ROBERT CECIL
               My lord of Southampton.
                      (looking around)
               Have you seen Essex?

                            SOUTHAMPTON
               I believe he is still in the viewing
               chamber with her majesty...

                              ROBERT CECIL
                        (sharp, annoyed)
               Alone?




                                                               21
                                                  pg. 22


                       SOUTHAMPTON
                 (smiles)
          With your father in London dealing
          with all the troubles in Ireland, who
          else should the Queen turn to but
          Essex?

Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the
SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall.

A FOOTMAN clears his throat and--

                       FOOTMAN
          By the grace of god, her majesty,
          Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and
          Ireland!

DOUBLE DOORS

open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is
wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a
wide collar.

She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor
in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like
she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her
(Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being
all the more regal, all the more un-human.

Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel-
encrusted doublet.

Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.

Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--

                       ESSEX
                 (to Elizabeth)
          Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord
          of Southampton has a gift for you.

                       ELIZABETH
                 (eyes sparkle)
          A gift?

                       SOUTHAMPTON
          Yes, your grace, though not from me.

Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room
OPENS.

A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors
swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music.


                                                           22
                                                  pg. 23


Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a
smile of total jubilation crosses her face.

Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.

                       ELIZABETH
          Are you this gift, my precious little
          man?

                       DWARF
          No, no, my most majestic majesty. I
          am a free man. My gift is a play,
          majesty.

                       ELIZABETH
          A play?

The dwarf bows his assent.

                       ROBERT CECIL
                 (to the Dwarf)
          Plays are the work of the devil, born
          from a cesspool of plague, whoredom,
          thievery, fornication, and heresy.
          You may tell your master that her
          majesty--

                       ESSEX
                 (interrupting)
          --Will gladly accept your gift.

Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked.

                       ESSEX (CONT'D)
                 (to Elizabeth)
          Of course that is if you so desire,
          majesty.
                 (to Robert Cecil)
          The choice is her majesty's to make,
          not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert?

Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the
political tides around her. Then--

                       ELIZABETH
                 (to the dwarf)
          Comedy? Or tragedy?

                       DWARF
          Comedy, majesty.

                       ELIZABETH
                 (delighted)
          A comedy!
                       (MORE)

                                                       pg. 24

                               ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                      (beat)
               By whom?

                            DWARF
               By... Anonymous, your majesty...

                             ELIZABETH
               Anonymous...?
                      (then)
               Oh, but I do so admire his verse...

     Elizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the
     Dwarf, who smiles brightly.

                            ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
               Lead us to this gift.

     And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex
     follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him.
     They exchange a knowing look as--

     Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not
     happy with this turn of events as we hear--

                            "QUINCE" (O.S.)
               Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee!      Thou
               art translated!

                                                           CUT TO:


23   EXT. THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT                          23

     Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the
     ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage"
     surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides.

                            "BOTTOM"
               I see their knavery: this is to make
               an ass of me; to fright me, if they
               could. But I will not stir from this
               place, do what they can.

     Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the
     grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of
     course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a
     young woman. Essex is next to her.




                                                                     24
                                                   pg. 25


ON STAGE

Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate
and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man--
except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a
commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now
dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the
fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck
hides behind a tree watching.

                         "BOTTOM" (CONT'D)
            I will walk up and down here, and I
            will sing, that they shall hear I am
            not afraid.

BACKSTAGE

Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully
observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that
seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep
emotion in him.

ON STAGE

                         "BOTTOM" (CONT'D)
                   (sings)
            The ousel cock so black of hue,
            With orange-tawny bill,
            The throstle with his note so true,
            The wren with little quill--

Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur.

                         "TITANIA"
            What angel wakes me from my flow'ry
            bed?

ELIZABETH

strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some
memory in her. A pleasant memory.

OXFORD

watches, delighted by her reaction.

FROM HIS POV

We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only
26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this
script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from
the same play. We are:


                                                            25
                                                      pg. 26


24   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    24

     Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches
     an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A
     Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a
     bit more thrown together).

     All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so.

     FROM BACKSTAGE

     A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw
     Oxford. This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old.
     But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the
     character of "Puck".

                             "OBERON" (O.S.)
                ...and the owner of it blest ever
                shall in safety rest. Trip away; make
                no stay;
                meet me all by break of day.

     And the characters of "Oberon" and "Titania" exit.     Boy
     Oxford hurries--

     ON STAGE

                             "PUCK"
                If we shadows have offended, think but
                this, and all is mended, that you have
                but slumber'd here while these visions
                did appear...

     Next to Young Elizabeth, JOHN DE VERE, Oxford's father,
     also watches, his face beaming with pride.

                             "PUCK" (CONT'D)
                ...And this weak and idle theme, No
                more yielding but a dream, gentles, do
                not reprehend; if you pardon, we will
                mend.

     A STERN LOOKING MAN

     is watching a few seats   away from Young Elizabeth.   He
     is WILLIAM CECIL (40's,   Robert's father). He is a
     Puritan, dressed all in   black (with a white lace
     collar), and has a long   beard. He is frowning,
     loathing the play.




                                                                  26
                                                        pg. 27


     ON STAGE

                             "PUCK" (CONT'D)
                So, good night unto you all. Give me
                your hands, if we be friends, and
                Robin shall restore amends.

     The play now over, Young Elizabeth applauds with
     delight, as do the small group of courtiers all around
     her.

                               YOUNG ELIZABETH
                Lovely.    Lovely!

                                                         CUT TO:


25   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - KITCHEN - LATER                        25

     A make-shift "back-stage" where all the young "actors"
     are removing their costumes and make-up, including Boy
     Oxford, who sits in front of a make-shift, leaning
     mirror.

     Much excited talking and commotion, until Boy Oxford
     notices everyone has gone silent. He turns-- his winged
     costume still on-- just as--

                               YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                Ah!    There he is.

     Young Elizabeth and her senior Court, including William
     Cecil and John De Vere, have entered.

     Boy Oxford bows deeply.

                             YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                       (to Boy Oxford)
                Your father tells me you wrote this
                evening's play yourself.

     Boy Oxford glances at his father-- should he answer
     directly? His father NODS.

                             BOY OXFORD
                I did indeed, your majesty.

                             YOUNG ELIZABETH
                You sport with me.
                       (smiling)
                Compose something.

                               BOY OXFORD
                Now?

                                                                   27
                                                  pg. 28


                        YOUNG ELIZABETH
          Yes.   Now.

                       BOY OXFORD
          On what subject, your grace?

She thinks.   Then--

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (smiles)
          Truth...

                       BOY OXFORD
                 (thinks, then--)
          For... Truth... is Truth...
          Though... never so old...
          and time cannot make that false,
          which once was true.

She smiles, claps.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (to John de Vere)
          My lord of Oxford. It seems you have
          added a poet to your family's long
          line of warriors.

                       BOY OXFORD
          Madam, I am as accomplished with the
          sword and the musket as I am with
          verse.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (amused)
          Are you indeed?

                       BOY OXFORD
                 (nods seriously)
          It is my only desire to one day be
          your majesty's most trusted servant in
          matters both of war and state, if you
          will but have me.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (charmed)
          Why, Lord Cecil, it seems we may very
          well have found your replacement.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope
          not too soon.

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
                      (teasing)
               And how liked you our young lord's
               play, William?

     William Cecil stiffens in discomfort.

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                      (to Boy Oxford,
                       conspiratorially)
               Our Lord Cecil is our most religious
               of subjects, and no doubt thinks your
               little masque will deliver your soul
               straight into the arms of Lucifer
               himself. Don't you, William?

     The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil, perplexed by
     such a thing.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               That is God's decision, your majesty.
               Not mine.

     William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting
     in an uncomfortable silence.

     Elizabeth notices.

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
               Well, if plays are indeed such a sin,
               I pray I do not find my salvation
               until very late in life.

     Boy Oxford smiles.   He might very well be in love.

26   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        26

     Thirty-eight years later. The door SWEEPS open and a
     snoring, sleeping Jonson is awakened by--

                              GUARD (O.S.)
               Jonson!    Ben Jonson!

     The other prisoners make way as the guard approaches
     Jonson. The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of
     parchment onto Jonson's lap.

                            GUARD (CONT'D)
               You've been released.

     Jonson looks at it, confused.

                                                                  29
                                                           pg. 30


                                GUARD (CONT'D)
                   Got powerful friends, now, don't you?


26A   EXT. A BOAT - RIVER THAMES - DAY                                26A

      Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time
      in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO--
      Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat
      of arms on its chest.

      The City of London is far in the distance.

      Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat
      for a moment before--

                                JONSON
                   And who are you?

      Francesco just stares back.

                                JONSON (CONT'D)
                   And where are we going?

      Francesco is silent.

      WIDER

      The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone.

                                                            CUT TO:

      A RED ROSE

      as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands.       We
      are:


27    EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                                 27

      Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he
      turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards
      him.

      Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De
      Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one
      of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).

      Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand
      place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.

                                JONSON
                   My lord...


                                                                      30
                                                  pg. 31


                       OXFORD
          The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of
          flowers, don't you think?

                       JONSON
          It looks to me to have quite a number
          of thorns, my lord.

                        OXFORD
          So it does.   So it does.

                       JONSON
          I am told, my lord, that I owe my
          freedom to you.

                       OXFORD
          That is true. And it was quite hard
          to come by. One does not cross my
          father-in-law lightly.

Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Lord William Cecil. I have the
          questionable distinction of being
          married to his only daughter.

Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them
suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and
Francesco to follow.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          It did, however, serve as helpful when
          I wrote to your jailers to release you
          in my father-in-law's name.

Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back
to Anne.

                       JONSON
                 (in a panicked whisper)
          My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my
          release is not officially sanctioned?

                        OXFORD
          Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it
          wasn't.
                 (beat)
          But you are free, are you not?

They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne
watches them as they disappear into the maze.



                                                           31
                                                     pg. 32


28   EXT. MAZE - DAY                                           28

     Oxford turns to Jonson.

                            OXFORD
               I enjoyed your little comedy last
               week, Jonson. You have potential,
               great potential.

                            JONSON
               Thank you, my lord.

                            OXFORD
               But it's politics did seem to have
               quite an effect on the Tower. My
               father-in-law's men felt it quite
               seditious.

                            JONSON
               Politics? My play had nothing to do
               with politics! It was just a simple
               comedy--

                             OXFORD
               That showed your betters as fools who
               go through life barely managing to get
               food from plate to mouth, were it not
               for the cleverness of their servants.
                      (beat)
               All art is political, Jonson.
               Otherwise it would just be decoration.
               And all artists have something to say,
               otherwise... they'd make shoes. And
               you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?

     As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to
     his servant.

                               OXFORD (CONT'D)
                      (nods)
               Francesco.

     Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather
     bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and
     opens it.

                            JONSON
               A play, my lord?

                            OXFORD
               One you shall stage Bankside.

                               JONSON
               Stage?

                                                              32
                                                  pg. 33


                       OXFORD
          Under your name.

                       JONSON
          My name, my lord?

                       OXFORD
          I can't very well use my name, can I?
          I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford.
          The Lord Great Chamberlain of England,
          Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales,
          Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc.
          No. I have a... reputation to
          protect. In my world, one does not
          write plays, Jonson. People like you
          do.

Jonson tries not to be offended.

                       JONSON
          Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire
          play, my lord. I know how difficult--

                       OXFORD
          Not a play, Jonson, I've written many.
          No doubt, many more than you yourself.
          A good number performed at Court years
          ago, others never seen by a living
          soul.

                       JONSON
          And you want... me to apply my name to
          this play?

                       OXFORD
          No. I mean you to put your name to
          all of them.

                         JONSON
          All of them?

                       OXFORD
          Well don't look like I just gutted
          your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make
          you the most popular-- and therefore
          the most monetarily successful--
          playwright in all of London.

Jonson pales.   This is a disaster for him.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          I wish you god speed and good morrow.

Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.

                                                           33
                                                      pg. 34


                            JONSON
               My lord-- I really--

     He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze
     without so much as a good-bye.

                              JONSON (CONT'D)
               My lord?

     But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather
     pouch of coins at his feet.

                            FRANCESCO
               That is for your trouble, Signor
               Jonson. And your silence. If I hear
               you break that silence, then... not so
               good for Signor Jonson.

     And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks
     up the pouch, examining its contents.

     And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out
     of the maze. He chases after them.

                             JONSON
               Hello?   My lord?! I--

     And he's lost. He looks this way and that, then picks
     a path (the wrong one).


29   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - DAY                                      29

     Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river   entrance
     to Cecil House, waiting for an enormous barge   docking.
     William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the   barge,
     waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an    ornately
     carved white cane.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               So! I am gone for three days, and you
               somehow manage to let her spend all of
               them solely in the company of the Earl
               of Essex...

     Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.   How did he know.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               Don't think because I was in London, I
               didn't know exactly what went on here
               in my absence.




                                                                34
                                                      pg. 35


                            ROBERT CECIL
               He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny
               him--

                             WILLIAM CECIL
               Of course not! You don't deny him
               anything. You find excuses. She is
               unwell, she is reading, she is seeing
               the Ambassador from Russia. For God's
               sake, use your imagination, Robert.
               Whatever will you do when I am gone?
                      (beat)
               We will have to deal with Essex soon.
               His ambitions are becoming a nuisance.


30   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           30

     William Cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to
     his son.


                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Now tell me about the play.

     Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he
     knows about that as well.

                            ROBERT CECIL
               It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex
               insisted it be performed, just to
               spite me in front of Court...

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Of course he did.
                      (concerned)
               But what was it about?

                            ROBERT CECIL
               About? Some nonsense about fairies
               and cherubs.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               ...And dancing asses?

     Robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped
     suddenly.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                      (realizing, to himself)
               Edward...
                      (to Robert Cecil)
               Have you any idea what you have-- No,
               how could you...

                                                               35
                                                    pg. 36


     And he starts back up the stairs.

                              ROBERT CECIL
               Father...    It was just a play...

                             WILLIAM CECIL
               And do you know how long it took me to
               banish them from her presence? She
               adores them! Adores them! And Edward
               knows it.
                      (beat)
               Mark my words, Robert, he has done
               this for a purpose.

                              ROBERT CECIL
               Purpose?    What purpose?

                            WILLIAM CECIL
                      (thinking, to himself)
               What purpose indeed?
                      (to Robert)
               But through your carelessness I must
               now deal not only with Essex, but
               Edward as well. For whether in shadow
               or in person, Edward has returned to
               Court!

     And with that he slams the door shut.

     Robert Cecil walks over to a nearby window. Visibly
     upset he starts to stare out of the window and
     remembers...

                                                        CUT TO:


31   OMIT                                                          31

     THROUGH A THIRD STORY WINDOW

     We see servants carrying big trunks. There are at least
     120 men on horses. They all wear the Oxford's crest.

                             WILLIAM CECIL (O.S)
               Robert.


32   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                              32

     And it is thirty years earlier.

     BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window.
     His back must have been deformed either in utero or at
     birth, because even now he is hunchbacked.

                                                                  36
                                                   pg. 37


                       WILLIAM CECIL(O.S.)
                 (more commanding)
          Robert! Come here.

Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford
(now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and
his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of
them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are
TUTORS.

Boy Robert Cecil doesn't move.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                 (to Young Oxford)
          I am sorry, my lord. But my son
          Robert prefers the company... of
          himself...

Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his
mother and sister.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and
          my daughter, Anne.

Young Anne curtsies.

                       YOUNG ANNE
          I am sorry for your loss, my lord.
          The realm lost a great lord with your
          father's death. We hope you will be
          happy in our house--

                       BOY ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)
          Are you going to live here forever?

Everybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has
finally come over.

                         YOUNG OXFORD
                   (smiles)
          No.    Only until I reach my maturity.

                        BOY ROBERT CECIL
          Why?

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Because the Queen has bade it so.
                 (to Young Oxford)
          My lord, when we first met, you said
          you wished to become a great man of
          State. Both the Queen and I hope to
          make that so.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          To that end, I have the honor of
          introducing you to your tutors.
                 (indicates one of them)
          Seven to eight you shall be tutored in
          French by Mister Crane--

                      YOUNG OXFORD
          Monsieur. Ca me fait plaisir de vous
          connaitre.

Master Crane bows his head.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Nine to ten is Greek with Mister
          Simmons.

                       YOUNG OXFORD
                 (in Greek)
          Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge
          esti ha trafo psychas.

                       BOY ROBERT CECIL
          Is that Homer?

                        YOUNG OXFORD
                  (sharp)
          No.   Plato.

Boy Robert frowns at the correction.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
                 (slight frown, then)
          And you know your uncle, Mister
          Golding, who has petitioned me to
          allow you to assist him in his
          translations of ancient Latin texts
          into English.

                       YOUNG OXFORD
                 (in Latin)
          Continetne, ut spero, Ovidii
          Metamorphose? Mihi honori erit,
          patrue

Mister Golding bows his head in appreciation.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Then cosmography with Doctor Richards.
          Two to three is geography and history,
          and four to five fencing.

William Cecil seems to have finished.

                      (to William Cecil)
               And composition? Poetry?

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               This is a Puritan home, your grace.
               We believe such activities to be the
               worship of false idols, and therefore
               a sin before the eyes of God.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               A sin? But surely there must be room
               for beauty and art in life, my lord.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Not in this household.


33   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                         33

     Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good.
     In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his
     age.

     Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess
     against himself.

     Young Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed
     attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES
     into the air, and hits--

     THE CHESS BOARD

     making the pieces scatter.

     WIDER

     Boy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see
     Young Oxford coming over to him.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               You were losing anyway.

                            BOY ROBERT CECIL
               I was also winning.

     Young Oxford picks up the sword, throws it to his
     tutor, who catches it.

                            BOY ROBERT CECIL
                            (CONT'D)
               You know I am going to one day succeed
               my father at the Queen's side. Not
               you.

                                                                39
                                                    pg. 40


     Young Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black
     king, and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil, who can't
     catch it because of his deformity. It CLANGS on the
     floor.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
                 Really?


34   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           34

     Moments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall
     alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his
     hand.

                                                     CUT TO:

     POEMS

     neatly written on parchment.   We are:


35   INT. CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORD'S ROOM - DAY               35

     And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly
     stuffing them into a bag.

     But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks
     for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door--
     he runs to it-- the door is locked!

     So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens,
     and Young Oxford enters.

     After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss.
     Looks at his--

     WRITING DESK

     where the parchments are scattered.

     YOUNG OXFORD

     goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of
     parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes
     through some other pages. And realizes other pages are
     missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees--

     UNDER THE TAPESTRY

     Two feet.




                                                               40
                                                        pg. 41


     WIDER

     Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand.     He
     THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry.

     The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just
     die, but screams and screams and screams.

     Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror... half in
     triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:


36   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DAY                      36

     Thirty-three years later.

     Shakespeare is on stage, taking a bow. The audience is
     APPLAUDING and SCREAMING their approval of a
     performance that has just ended. He steps backwards--

     BACKSTAGE

     --where Jonson stands holding the manuscript Oxford
     gave him.

                              SHAKESPEARE
                 Is it any good?

                              JONSON
                 How in blazes should I know?

                              SHAKESPEARE
                 You haven't even read it?

     And Shakespeare is drawn back--

     ON STAGE

     --where he bows again, then steps--

     BACKSTAGE

     --so Jonson can answer him.

                              JONSON
                 I read a line or two-- I promised
                 Henslowe I'd finish "Eastward Ho" by
                 Saturday.

                              SHAKESPEARE
                 And you say he's a nobleman?

     Jonson doesn't answer.


                                                                 41
                                                       pg. 42


                             SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
               Powerful?   Rich??

     Jonson still doesn't answer, which is answer enough.

                            SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
               Ohhhh, you have to do it then, don't
               you?

     And Shakespeare goes back on stage.


37   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                  37

     Jonson and Shakespeare are walking along Bankside,
     still mid-conversation. They pass all sorts of vendors
     selling fish, fresh water, food, etc...

                            JONSON
               I tell you Will-- I came to London to
               become a great poet, to, to, be the
               conscience of our times, the soul of
               our age! To change the world, not to
               become someone else's--

                            SHAKESPEARE
                      (amused)
               Change the world? With rhyme?

                            JONSON
               Yes, why not? Why can't a man change
               the world with words?

     Shakespeare laughs at him.

                            JONSON (CONT'D)
                      (mimicking Oxford)
               "I can make you the most popular and
               the richest playwright in all of
               London."
                      (takes a swig)
               Ballocks! I can do that myself, thank
               you very much.


38   INT. THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - NIGHT                           38

     Shakespeare is perusing the manuscript.   Some of the
     actors from the Rose are in the BG.

                            SHAKESPEARE
               You know, it's actually not half
               bad...


                                                                42
                                                         pg. 43


     Jonson takes a swig of ale, then--

                              JONSON
                 Not half--?! You're an actor, what in
                 God's name do you know about writing?!
                 He's an amateur, Will, a complete and
                 utter amateur. Last week gardening,
                 this week playwrighting, next week
                 hawking.
                        (takes another swig)
                 No. I won't do it. It would be an
                 affront against the Muses...

                              SHAKESPEARE
                        (smiles)
                 Well we musn't offend the muses,
                 whatever we do.
                        (thinks, then)
                 How much money did you say he gave
                 you?

                              JONSON
                 What, you think my name can be bought,
                 if the number's great enough, do you?

     Shakespeare smiles enigmatically.

                              SHAKESPEARE
                 No, not at all... I think we should
                 keep your good name quite intact,
                 thank you very much.

     Jonson frowns, confused as we--

                                                          CUT TO:

     A RED WIG

     as it is placed on the head of Elizabeth.   We are:


39   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY           39

     Elizabeth is behind an elaborately painted screen.
     Several ladies-in-waiting attend her, helping her get
     ready for the day. It's an intricate process. Make-
     up, multiple articles of clothing, jewelry...

                              WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)
                 King Philip of Spain sees the current
                 Catholic revolt in Ireland as a
                 weakness of ours. A weakness to be
                 exploited....


                                                                    43
                                                  pg. 44


Elizabeth's wig is being glued into place.

                       ELIZABETH
          Ireland?

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN (THEN INTERCUT EACH SIDE
OF SCREEN AS NEEDED)

William Cecil hasn't realized that his son Robert has
sneaked in the room behind him to listen in.

                        WILLIAM CECIL
          There are rumors of his sending
          financial aid, and even troops. We
          must act quickly.
                 (beat)
          We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of
          Ireland, and send additional troops
          immediately, majesty.

                        ELIZABETH
          Replace?   With whom?

William Cecil hesitates slightly, then--

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          I would recommend the Earl of Essex,
          your majesty.

                       ELIZABETH
          Essex?  To Ireland?
                 (frowns)
          For how long?

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          As long as the present crisis
          warrants, majesty.

                       ELIZABETH
          Impossible. He cannot be spared. We
          feel his counsel is of greater import
          with each passing day.

Not what William Cecil wanted to hear.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          I only recommend we send your most
          able subjects where they are most
          needed, majesty.
                 (beat, a last-ditch
                  effort)
          Philip of Spain dreams still of taking
          your kingdom from you.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          Of burning you at the stake as a
          heretic. Give him a foot-hold in
          Ireland, and--

                       ELIZABETH
          But Essex?

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Essex's martial abilities are, in my
          opinion, the only antidote to the
          plague of Philip.
                 (clears his throat)
          Though, Essex would not,
          unfortunately, be able to remain in
          the Privy Council if he is in
          Ireland...

                       ELIZABETH
          And who would you advise to replace
          him?

Three ladies-in-waiting approach with three different
gown. Elizabeth studies them as:

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Sir Robert Cecil.

                       ELIZABETH
          Your son?

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          He is my own advisor first, my son
          second, majesty. His counsel has been
          invaluable to me, and no doubt will be
          to you as well.

Elizabeth points to one of the dresses, and waves the
handmaidens away.

                       ELIZABETH
          Yes, yes, yes. We will send Essex to
          Ireland and place Robert on my Privy
          Council.

But William's flash of victory is dampened by--

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I saw a play this last weekend,
          William. It made me think of... days
          long past. Of memories... long past.
          Long past. I should like to see more
          of them...
          Has Edward been happy, William? With
          your daughter?

                                                    pg. 46


     William Cecil doesn't answer. Instead he thinks,
     remembers, as we hear his younger voice...

                             WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)
               Murdered!

                                                        CUT TO:


40   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                           40

     Thirty years earlier.

     William Cecil is standing in front of an enormous
     fireplace, pacing in a pique of anger.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               By your own hand!

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               He was stealing my poems.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               He was doing my bidding!

                             YOUNG OXFORD
               Yours?

                           WILLIAM CECIL
               Of course. As soon as Robert informed
               me that you were disobeying my
               express--

                             YOUNG OXFORD
               Robert?   Robert told--

     William Cecil SLAMS his fists on a table.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Enough! Thou shalt not worship false
               idols in my household! Your
               everlasting soul hangs in the balance.
               Not poems. Your soul!

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               My poems are my soul!

     William Cecil turns away in frustration as much as
     disgust.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               You have placed me in a grave
               position, Edward.

                                                       pg. 47

                             WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               I cannot have my reputation soiled by
               this regrettable lack of control on
               your part... No. I will not have it.
               We can claim self-defense, he drew
               sword first.
                      (beat)
               But... I wish something in return.

     Young Oxford looks worried.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               My daughter is young, impressionable.
               She has feelings for you, Edward. It
               is to be expected, living in such
               close quarters...

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               Sir. For the last three years you
               have managed to seize much of my
               inheritance--

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Hold your tongue, Edward, before you
               make a claim you cannot retract! I
               have been legally reimbursed for your
               education and living expenses.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               And now you suggest you be
               "reimbursed" the rest of my once
               considerable estates through your
               daughter's bed?

     William Cecil studies Young Oxford's face.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               No. This is how I suggest you keep
               your noble head from the executioner's
               block.

     YOUNG OXFORD

     stares at him.   The SOUND of CHURCH BELLS RINGING takes
     us to:


41   INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                                41

     And Young Oxford and Anne are being married by a
     bishop.




                                                                47

               ...and in the fear of god, duly
               considering the causes for which
               matrimony was ordained. One was the
               procreation of children...

     WILLIAM CECIL

     appears triumphant.   He looks beaming over to...

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
               ...to be brought up in the fear and
               nurture of the Lord and praise of God.
               Secondly, it was ordained for a remedy
               against sin.

     YOUNG ELIZABETH

     Who presides over the whole affair. The first time we
     see a dress on her which makes her truly regal.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
               Thirdly, for the mutual society, help
               and comfort, that the one ought to
               have of the other, both in prosperity
               and adversity, into the which holiest
               state these two persons present come
               now to be joined.

     AT THE ALTAR

     Young Anne looks at her young husband, lovingly. Young
     Oxford is a bit overwhelmed and unsure of it all. And
     then we HEAR a trumpet BLARING, which takes us to:


42   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                 42

     Thirty-two years later.

     Vendors hawk food and drink as they walk through the
     audience.

     IN OXFORD'S BOX

     Oxford sits, Francesco behind him, exhilarated by the
     scene below him.

     IN THE GALLERIES

     Marlowe, Dekker and Nashe are looking at their single-
     sheet programs.



                                                                48

                        NASHE
           "Henry V" by... No one?

                        MARLOWE
           And why would any of you admit to
           trying to better me in a historical
           drama? Comedy, yes, tragedy, perhaps.
           But never will one of you best me in
           historicals.

Marlowe takes a swig of ale, and spots Jonson coming to
join them.

                        MARLOWE (CONT'D)
           Or will we be seeing a most hysterical
           historical?

Jonson sits next to Marlowe.

                        MARLOWE (CONT'D)
           Hmm? Ben? Waiting to see how it's
           received before you lay claim??

Before Jonson can answer--

ON STAGE

An actor, CONDELL (40's), dressed all in white (even
his face is painted white) enters stage. He is
"Prologue". He addresses the audience directly.

                        "PROLOGUE"
           Oh, for a muse of fire, that would
           ascend the brightest heaven of
           invention. A kingdom for a stage,
           princes to act, and monarchs to behold
           the swelling scene! Then should
           warlike Harry, like himself, assume
           the port of Mars, and at his heels
           should famine, sword, and fire crouch
           for his employment. Can this cockpit
           hold the vasty fields of France?

IN THE GALLERIES

Jonson seems surprised.   This is not what he expected.
This is good.

43   EXT. THE ENGLISH COUNTRY-SIDE - DAY                        43

     And Southampton is riding his horse at full gallop
     through the countryside. About two dozen retainers
     follow, the first few with Southampton's coat-of-arms
     on flags.


44   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                44

     It is later in the play.

     On stage, about 15 actors are in full battle armor.
     They include: "HENRY V", played by the actor called
     Spencer, "WESTMORELAND", "EXETER", "SALISBURY". All
     the men on stage now wear battle armor.

                             "HENRY V"
                This day is called the feast of
                Crispian: he that outlives this day,
                and comes safe home, will stand a tip-
                toe when this day is named, and rouse
                him at the name of Crispian.

     IN THE GALLERIES

     Marlowe, Dekker, Nashe and Jonson all watch, obviously
     impressed. Nashe takes a swig of Ale.

     IN OXFORD'S BOX

     Oxford watches, loving the stagecraft involved in the
     production.

                             "HENRY V" (CONT'D)
                He that shall see this day and live
                t'old age, will yearly on the vigil
                feast his neighbors, and say 'To-
                morrow is Saint Crispian.

     ON STAGE

     "Henry V" speaks to his men.

                             "HENRY V" (CONT'D)
                Then will he strip his sleeve and show
                his scars.

     The actor playing "Henry" kneels at the front of the
     stage. He speaks to the groundlings as though they are
     his troops.




                                                               50

           And say 'These wounds I had on
           Crispin's day.' Old men forget: yet
           all shall be forgot, but he'll
           remember with advantages what feats he
           did that day. This story shall the
           good man teach his son.

THE GROUNDLINGS

become literally spellbound.

                        "HENRY V" (CONT'D)
           And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go
           by, from this day to the ending of the
           world, but we in it shall be
           remembered; we few, we happy few, we
           band of brothers; for he to-day that
           sheds his blood with me shall be my
           brother; be he ne'er so vile, this day
           shall gentle his condition: and
           gentlemen in England now a-bed shall
           think themselves accursed they were
           not here, and hold their man-hoods
           cheap whiles any speaks that fought
           with us upon Saint Crispin's day!

The entire audience stands and CHEERS madly.

OXFORD

watches, with a pride he has never felt.

IN THE GALLERIES

The "wits" look at each other amazed.

ON STAGE

                        "SALISBURY"
           My sovereign lord, bestow yourself
           with speed. The French are bravely in
           their battles set and will with all
           expedience charge on us.

                        "HENRY V"
           All things are ready, if our minds be
           so.

                        "WESTMORELAND"

           now!

                 all!

     THE "HUT"

     which is a round tower on top of the stage, contains
     several small cannons manned by stagehands. They shoot
     BLANK CANNON SHOTS.


45   EXT. THE CITY GATES OF LONDON - DAY                           45

     Southampton and his retainers gallop through a City
     gate. Above the gate, the severed heads of murderers
     sit on pikes.


46   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   46

     Actors portraying French soldiers STORM the stage,
     swords brandished. "Henry" and his men begin fighting
     them, their swordplay elaborate and impressive.


47   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                      47

     Southampton and his entourage gallop over London
     Bridge.


48   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   48

     The battle rages on stage.

     One hardy audience member starts to actually ATTACK one
     of the French "soldiers" himself. He's quickly joined
     by a few comrades-- and it quickly becomes a madhouse;
     half play, half real fight, as more audience members
     join the "battle". The play quickly degenerates into a
     bloody brawl between actors and audience.


49   EXT/INT. ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   49

     Southampton arrives at the theater.   He jumps   off his
     horse, and hurries--

     INTO THE STAIRWELL

     jumping two steps at a time. We HEAR the sound of
     APPLAUSE. The play is now over. Southampton hurries
     into--


                                                                  52

            William Cecil's convinced the Queen
            that only Essex can save Ireland from
            the Revolt.

Oxford processes this.

                         SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
            I've pledged to go with him, Edward.
            We sail in an hour.

BACKSTAGE

Shakespeare, standing next to a small table of props,
quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them

piece of parchment under his arm, then hurries--

     Oxford tries to understand Southampton, but then
     notices Shakespeare on stage. His mouth opens in
     shock, and he turns to look across the theater at--

     JONSON

     who guiltily looks away.   Marlowe's mouth is open, his
     hands stop applauding.

     IN OXFORD'S BOX

     Southampton is angered by Oxford's distraction.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                I am sorry to have disturbed your
                entertainment.

     And he exits.

     But the younger man is gone.

     ON STAGE

     Shakespeare bows, then--

                I, I... It's been... I, I, want
                to... thank my actors, whose great
                acting brought... my words... to life
                due to their most finest acting.
                Ah... Thank you.

     The multi-arched ceiling is painted blue with gold
     stars. Globes-- both terrestrial and astral-- abound.

     Jonson stands in front of a very angry Oxford.

                             OXFORD
                An actor for god's sake?

                             JONSON
                My lord, I thought that--


                                                                   54

                             OXFORD
                You presumed to think? On my behalf?
                Whatever made you believe you had that
                prerogative?

     A beat.   Jonson is a bit afraid.

                             JONSON
                My lord, your voice is completely
                different than mine. My, my, my
                characters are--

                             OXFORD
                Voice? You have no voice! That's why
                I chose you!
                       (beat, softer)
                You at least kept my name from him?

     Jonson NODS.

                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                And will continue to do so?

     Oxford studies him, believes him.   Then he opens a
     cabinet.

     In it, manuscript after manuscript are stacked.     Jonson
     looks behind him, stunned by the number.

     Oxford looks up and down the cabinet. He pulls one
     out, decides no, and puts it back, looking for just the
     right one... He pulls another out, then hands it to
     Jonson.

                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                A romantic tragedy. In iambic
                pentameter.

                             JONSON
                       (amazed)
                All, my lord? Is that possible?

                             OXFORD
                Of course it is!


51   INT. OXFORD STONE - HALLWAY - DAY                             51

     Jonson exits Oxford's study, still amazed at the
     manuscript as he walks.

     He passes ANNE, Oxford's wife (now 40's), who is on her
     way to the study with their eldest daughter, BRIDGET
     (17).

                                                                  55
                                                       pg. 56


     She watches him go by and immediately realizes that she
     has seen him before. But she stays silent.


52   INT. OXFORD STONE - STUDY - DAY                             52

     Oxford is writing at a desk as Anne enters.

                            ANNE
               Who was that man?    I've seen him
               before.

     Oxford holds up a finger to prevent her from speaking
     while he finishes writing a thought. It's a long
     thought. Anne is obviously annoyed, and interrupts
     him.

                            ANNE (CONT'D)
               Edward-- we must discuss our Bridget's
               dowry.

                              OXFORD
                        (looking up - confused)
               Dowry?

     He remembers when he spies his daughter.

                            ANNE
               She cannot go into marriage without a
               dowry that is becoming to the daughter
               of the Earl Oxford.

                            OXFORD
               I can give her Brooke House and a
               hundred pounds.

                            BRIDGET
               A hundred pounds? Father?     Mother!

                            OXFORD
               That is all we have to give at the
               moment.

     The matter over, Oxford goes back to his writing.

                            ANNE
                      (furious)
               Edward. Edward! Speak to me! Our
               family is in financial ruins, and, and
               you, you play the flute while Rome
               burns!

     Oxford turns.


                                                                56
                                                 pg. 57


                       OXFORD
          Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned.

And then he goes back to writing.

                       ANNE
          For god's sake, who cares Edward?
          When your own daughter can't even have
          a suitable dowry?

She stares at him.

                       ANNE (CONT'D)
          My god, you're writing again, aren't
          you? After you agreed-- after my
          father expressly forbade it!

Oxford turns to her, full of emotion

                       OXFORD
          Anne-- If you could have seen them--
          the mob... They, they didn't just sit
          there like the reptilia of court,
          faces motionless, fangs momentarily
          retracted. No! They, they jumped on
          stage, they fought the French! A
          butcher-- he actually broke his arm!
          He was so--

                        ANNE
          Stop!   Stop it at once!!

Anne storms over and grabs the parchment from under
him, and begins RIPPING it up.

                       ANNE (CONT'D)
          Why!? Why must you write?! Why must
          you continue to humiliate this family?

He stares at her, almost uncomprehendingly.   Then--

                       OXFORD
          The voices, Anne... The voices. I, I
          can't stop them... They, they come
          when I sleep, when I wake, when I sup,
          when I, I, I walk down a hall! The
          sweet longings of a maiden, the, the
          surging ambitions of a courtier, the
          foul designs of a murderer, the
          wretched pleas of his victims.    Only-
          - only when I put their words-- their
          voices-- to parchment are they cast
          loose, freed... Only then is my
          mind... quieted... at peace.

                                                          57
                                                       pg. 58


     Anne steps back, frightened of him.

                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
               I... would go mad if I didn't write
               down the voices.

     She stares at him, horrified.

                            ANNE
               Art thou possessed?

     He stares back at her.   A long beat

                            OXFORD
               I... don't know.

                            SHAKESPEARE (O.S.)
               "Two households, both alike in
               dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay
               our scene"


53   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    53

     Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge--
     the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it
     is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost
     like a mall.

     Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of
     "Romeo and Juliet"

                            SHAKESPEARE
               "From ancient grudge break to new
               mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil
               hands unclean."
                      (no longer reading)
               Incredible!! The whole bloody thing
               in verse?!

                            JONSON
                      (nonchalant)
               It's really not that difficult, if you
               try.

                            SHAKESPEARE
               And have you ever tried?

     Jonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some
     onions from a stand.

     Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples
     at the next stand.


                                                                58
                                                 pg. 59


                       SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
                 (performing for the
                  Blonde)
          "But soft, what light through yonder
          window breaks?
          It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
          Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious
          moon,
          Who is already sick and pale with
          grief, That thou her maid art far more
          fair than she."

The Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively.

                       SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
                 (to Jonson)
          I'll have little trouble parting the
          legs of barmaids after that
          performance!

                       JONSON
          You can't play Romeo.

Jonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street.
Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling
smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after
Jonson.

                        SHAKESPEARE
                 (to Jonson)
          Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer
          have another go at one of my roles.
          No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump
          the life into Romeo's veins.
                 (grins at another passing
                  girl)
          And his cod piece!
                 (beat, desperate)
          Ben-- Ben! I'm an actor, every inch
          of me, down to my very toes... I want-
          - no, I need, crave-- to act. I can't
          just idle the day by with--

                       JONSON
          So bloody well act like a writer! And
          for God's sake, keep off the stage.
          Writers don't have time to act.

                                           DISSOLVE TO:

54   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  54

     A performance of "Romeo and Juliet". About a dozen
     actors are dancing. It is Act 1, Scene 5. "ROMEO",
     played by Spencer, is staring longingly at "Juliet".
     "Romeo" turns to his servant.

                              "ROMEO"
                 What lady's that, which doth enrich
                 the hand of yonder knight?

                              "SERVANT"
                 I know not, sir.

                              "ROMEO"
                 O, she doth teach the torches to burn
                 bright! It seems she hangs upon the
                 cheek of night like a rich jewel in an
                 Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use,
                 for earth too dear!

     The actor playing Romeo plays to the women in the
     audience. And

     THE WOMEN

     respond, eye lashes twittering.

     THE WITS

     Watch in awe!   Now they're all taking swigs of ale.

     BACKSTAGE

     Shakespeare mouthing silently the lines of "Romeo".

     IN OXFORD'S BOX

     Oxford watches the dance carefully.

                              "ROMEO" (CONT'D)
                 Did my heart love till now? Forswear
                 it, sight! For I ne'er saw true
                 beauty till this night.

55   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    55

     Twenty-eight years earlier. A dance is taking place.

     YOUNG OXFORD-- now 20 is dancing with Young Anne.     But
     his eyes are on:

                                                                 60
                                                  pg. 61


Young Elizabeth, who is dancing with the Spanish
AMBASSADOR.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

seems less than interested in her dancing partner.    She
STARES intently back at Young Oxford.

WIDER

There is a natural change in the music, and all the
dancers switch partners-- it's part of the dance.
Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish
Ambassador goes to Anne.

YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD

stare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate
moves.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          My lord of Oxford.

Elizabeth smiles.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          We liked your play tonight very much.
          Your young King Henry reminded us of
          you.

                       OXFORD
          Did he?

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          Rash, yet brave. A boy-- and yet a
          man. Fair on the eyes, fairer to the
          ear...

WIDER

Much of the Court is watching this.   They can tell
there are sparks between them.

All the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth
and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again
finds himself with Elizabeth.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          We are glad of your return from the
          continent. Two years is far too long
          to be without such excellent
          amusements.

Young Oxford dips his head slightly in acknowledgment.

                                                            61
                                                     pg. 62


                          YOUNG OXFORD
             If I had known my absence would cause
             your grace so much... longing, I would
             have returned much-- much-- sooner.

Was that a come-on?    Young Elizabeth decides to find
out.

                          YOUNG ELIZABETH
             Your wife must be much pleased by your
             presence once more at her side...

Young Oxford glances over at--

YOUNG ANNE

who is now dancing with the Spanish Ambassador. But
she watches Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford with a
great deal of jealousy.

WILLIAM CECIL

Follows his daughter's look. He doesn't like what he
sees any more than Young Anne does.

BACK TO YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD

Still dancing.

                          YOUNG OXFORD
             If she is, it is but a small comfort
             to me. I am returned only under my
             father-in-law's insistence.

A beat as this sinks in.

                          YOUNG ELIZABETH
                    (surprised)
             Cecil had told me your match was one
             of love.

                          YOUNG OXFORD
             And so he would wish.
                    (long beat)
             But how could one ever love the moon,
             after having first seen the sun?

He stares intensely into her eyes.    And she stares
right back.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:




                                                              62

57    EXT. RICHMOND PALACE - BALCONY - DAY                         57

      Three Ladies-in-waiting run onto the balcony to join
      Bessie, who is looking across the palace grounds,
      watching--


56    EXT. RICHMOND PALACE - FOREST - SAME TIME                    56

      Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford, both on horseback,
      unaccompanied, trot over a small bridge.


56A   EXT. RICHMOND PALACE - BALCONY - SAME TIME                  56A

      The Ladies-in-waiting giggle, but are interrupted by--

                             WILLIAM CECIL (O.S.)
                Where is her majesty?

      Bessie turns to William Cecil.

                             BESSIE
                My lord. Her majesty went riding with
                the Earl of Oxford.

      The Ladies-in-waiting share knowing smiles.


56B   EXT. RICHMOND PALACE - FOREST - SAME TIME                   56B

      Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford share flirty glances,
      and then Young Elizabeth spurs her horse to a gallop,
      and dashes into the fog. Young Oxford immediately
      follows.

                                                        CUT TO:


58    INT. A ROYAL TENT - LATER                                    58

      A servant places a silver plate filled with shucked
      oysters onto a table filled with quail, venison, wine,
      etc...

      Young Elizabeth sits across from Young Oxford.   It's
      just the two of them dining.

                             YOUNG ELIZABETH
                And which country did you like the
                most on your travels, my lord?

                             YOUNG OXFORD
                I think Italy, your grace.

                                                                  63

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
               And why is that? The weather?       The
               food?

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               No their theater, which they call la
               Commedia dell'arte. And, of course,
               the women.

     She raises an eyebrow.

                              YOUNG ELIZABETH
               The women?

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               They were more... clear with their
               desires than our English ladies. When
               they want something, they take it.
               They do not wait to be taken...

                                                SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


59   OMIT                                                            59


60   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - RECEIVING CHAMBER - NIGHT                60

     A door SLAMS open, and Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford
     dash in, ripping each others clothes off in the
     fireplace-lit room.

     Young Elizabeth gently pushes Young Oxford towards her
     throne... She kisses him. Then begin to make love.
     On the throne.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     LATER

     Postcoital, the fire still lit. Young Elizabeth is
     half asleep, half awake, nestled in furs in front of
     the fireplace... much like Titania in "Midsummer
     Night's Dream"...

     Young Oxford watches her as she stirs and wakes.      She
     smiles at him.

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH
               I can't decide. Are you Prince
               Hal...? Or Romeo? No. Benedick,
               maybe...?
               No--
                            (MORE)

                                                                    64
                                                    pg. 65

                         YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                   (smiles)
          --Puck

                         YOUNG OXFORD
                   (smiles)
          Puck?

                         YOUNG ELIZABETH
          Yes, Puck!

She's only teasing.

                       YOUNG OXFORD
          Ah, but Puck would never fight for you
          in the Netherlands...

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (surprised, smiles)
          The Netherlands?

But then she realizes he's serious, and the smile
vanishes.

                       YOUNG OXFORD
          Well, why not? It's an open secret on
          the continent that you support the
          rebels against Spain-- and that you
          are commissioning Englishmen to help
          their cause. Spain's loss is
          England's gain, is it not?

Her eyes narrow as she studies his face.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          Is this why you bedded me? For a
          commission?

                        YOUNG OXFORD
          No.   No-- of course not--    I--

She stands, wrapped in her sheets, furious at the
thought of once more being used.

                         YOUNG ELIZABETH
          Leave me.    Leave at once!

A beat.

                         YOUNG OXFORD
          Bess--

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          How dare you! How dare you!! I
          command you to leave my presence.

                                                             65
                                                 pg. 66


And she steps back, waiting for him to exit.

Young Oxford stands... and starts to approach her...
He's nude, his back to us.

She steps back, a bit stunned by his impertinence.   He
steps towards her as--

                        YOUNG OXFORD
          O Mistress mine, where are you
          roaming?
          O stay and hear... your true-love's
          coming,
          That can--
                 (looks up and down her
                  body)
          --kiss both high and low...

A bit stunned by his approach, she stumbles backwards
on her sheets.

                       YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Trip no further, pretty sweeting....

But he's sexy... and naked. And spouting poetry.     She
stops retreating and allows his approach.

                       YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Journeys end in lovers' meeting--
          Every wise man's son doth know.

A small smile escapes her lips.

                       YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
          What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
          Present mirth hath present laughter;
          What's to come is still unsure:

He starts to kiss her neck.   Cautiously at first.   But
she likes it.

                       YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
          In delay there lies no plenty--
          Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty,
          Youth's a stuff will not endure.

She responds to him, melting from both his words and
touch. They start to kiss deeply, passionately... And-
-

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
                 (passionately)
          You will stay in England... And in...
          my chambers...

                                                           66
                                                       pg. 67


     The flash of disappointment on Young Oxford's face
     about that last bit is tempered by Young Elizabeth's
     sheet falling to the floor. They begin to make love
     passionately once more.

                            NASHE (O.S.)
               I could do it if I wanted to...


61   INT. THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - DAY                             61

     Twenty-seven years later. Jonson, Marlowe, Dekker and
     Nashe sit silently at a table, mugs of ale in hand.
     Having just returned from "Romeo and Juliet", all are a
     bit in shock. The actors from the perfomance are there
     as well in the BG.

                            MARLOWE
                      (to Nashe)
               Do what?

                            NASHE
                      (a little drunk)
               A play in iambic, in iambic pen...in-
               bic-pentameter. It's not that hard.

                            JONSON
               Think you so? Have you ever tried?

                            NASHE
               Of course not. But I could if I
               wanted...

                            DEKKER
               It wasn't all in verse.

                              NASHE
               Ha!   See!   Even easier!

     Shakespeare enters and makes a bee line for them.

                            SHAKESPEARE
                      (excited)
               Henslowe wants "Romeo" to run a
               fortnight.
                      (unbelievable news)
               A fortnight! Innkeeper! A round for
               everybody! Inkeeper!!
                      (no response)
               Billy!!!

     And Shakespeare goes over to the bar.



                                                                67
                                                       pg. 68


                                NASHE
                 A fortnight?

                              DEKKER
                 The maids love the romantic tragedies.

                              MARLOWE
                 Precisely why I avoid them.

                             NASHE
                 Aw, well. No worries. A one-trick
                 pony. He'll never be able to do it
                 again.


62   INT./EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                            62

     A MONTAGE of various plays:

     "TWELFTH NIGHT"

     Viola and Sebastian are reunited...

     "CAESAR"

     Caesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc...

     "MACBETH"

     The witches are on stage.

     These three performances are INTER-CUT with:

     PLAYBILLS

     outside the Rose, announcing each play's title.      At
     first, Shakespeare's name is small, with each
     succeeding play his name gets bigger. And--

     AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE

     Shakespeare bows to the ever-increasing applause of his
     audience. He looks up to see the Mermaid's Wits all
     watching him with stony silence.

     And as each play is seen, Jonson and the rest of the
     Wits seem more and more depressed.

     And after each performance, Shakespeare seems to be
     greeted with more and more adulation.

     The MONTAGE ends with...



                                                                68
                                                       pg. 69


     A PLAYBILL

     in front of the theater announcing "William
     Shakespeare's Hamlet". Shakespeare's name is now above
     the title. We HEAR the audience howl with LAUGHTER as--


63   INT. ROSE THEATER - DAY                                     63

     An actor playing "POLONIUS" does an obvious caricature
     of William Cecil, dressed in black with an exaggerated
     rendition of Cecil's beard.

                               "POLONIUS"
                         (over-acting)
                  ...Beware of entrance to a quarrel,
                  but being in, bear it that the opposed
                  may beware of thee. Give every man
                  thy ear, but few thy voice, take each
                  man's censure, but reserve thy
                  judgment....


64   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY              64

     Elizabeth watches the same play at a court performance.
     We see Elizabeth smiling amused as "Polinous" continues
     his rant...

                               "POLINOUS"
                  ....Costly thy habit as thy purse can
                  buy, but not expressed in fancy, rich,
                  nor gaudy, for the apparel oft
                  proclaims the man. This above all, to
                  thine own self be true.

     Elizabeth absent mindedly starts to scratch her chest,
     irritated by some sort of itch, but still focused on
     the play.


65   INT. ROSE THEATER - DAY                                     65

     Jonson watches tight lipped...

     The character of GERTRUDE", the Queen, is joined by
     "HAMLET". "Polonius" is behind a curtain, listening
     in, and is seen by the audience. "Hamlet" appears
     enraged.

                               "GERTRUDE"
                  What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not
                  murder me? Help, ho!


                                                                69
                                                      pg. 70


                            "POLONIUS"
                      (behind curtain)
               What ho, help!

     "Hamlet" draws his sword.

                             "HAMLET"
               How now?   A rat? Dead, for a ducat,
               dead!

     "Hamlet" stabs "Polonius" through the curtain.

                            "POLONIUS"
               O, I am slain.

     "Polonius" emerges from behind the curtain, covered in
     pig's blood, and dies an anguished death.

     There is stunned silence in the audience. And then one
     lone Groundling CLAPS, then another, then the whole
     audience.

                            GROUNDLING
               Not a day too soon for old Cecil!!


66   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY             66

     Elizabeth is still scratching her chest, but more
     vigorously as some of the members of court give
     uncomfortable glances at each other over the death of
     William Cecil-- er "Polonius" onstage.

                            "GERTRUDE"
               O me, what hast thou done?

                            "HAMLET"
               Nay, I know not. Is it the King?

                            "HAMLET" (CONT'D)
               Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,
               farewell! I took thee for thy better:
               take thy fortune; Thou find'st to be
               too busy is some danger. Leave
               wringing of your hands: peace! sit you
               down, And let me wring your heart; for
               so I shall, If it be made of
               penetrable stuff,
               If damned custom have not brass'd it
               so
               That it is proof and bulwark against
               sense.



                                                               70
                                                    pg. 71


     Elizabeth can't take the itching anymore. She RIPS
     open her bodice and violently scratches some sort of
     rash on her chest.


67   INT/EXT. ROSE THEATER - DAY                               67

     Oxford is in his usual box, but completely alone.   He
     has a smile of satisfaction on his lips while...

     JONSON

     Looks over to Oxford with astonishment... While on
     stage the world sees for the first time "Hamlet"
     contemplating suicide.

                            "HAMLET"
               To be, or not to be: that is the
               question: whether `tis nobler in the
               mind to suffer the slings and arrows
               of outrageous fortune, or to take arms
               against a sea of troubles, and by
               opposing end them...

     Loud thunder and...

     RAIN STARTS TO FALL

     And as only the stage and the galleries are covered,
     the groundlings are pelted with the cold drops of
     water. But they stay. They stay. They cover
     themselves up, and silently watch on.

                            "HAMLET'
               ...To die, to sleep- no more- and by a
               sleep to say we end the heartache, and
               the thousand natural shocks that flesh
               is heir to...

     The audience-- soaked, pelted with rain-- watches
     immobile.

     And then a again a loud thunder clap takes us to the
     end of the play...

     SHAKESPEARE

     Bows to the thunderous applause. It is still raining,
     but nobody wants to leave. While-

     THE MERMAID'S WITS

     watch in the crowd, a complex range of emotions, but
     jealousy and loathing at the top of the list.

                                                              71
                                                        pg. 72


      ON STAGE

      some of the audience members grab Shakespeare, and pull
      him on their shoulders, carrying him triumphantly out
      of the theater.

                                                         CUT TO:


68    EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON - DAY                 68


      Marlowe walks towards the Tower of London.


68A   INT. TOWER OF LONDON / POLE'S ROOM - DAY                     68A

      Silence....Marlowe is waiting patiently...

      He is sitting across from Pole, the Captain of the
      Guard, who is reading his report....

                              POLE
                        (looks up)
                 Are you certain of this?
                        (almost confused)
                 William Cecil was murdered?

                              MARLOWE
                 Not literally, of course. He was a
                 character, a fictional character. But
                 the metaphor was clear for anyone to
                 see. And see, they did.

      Pole reads more from the parchment.

                              MARLOWE (CONT'D)
                 Will you shut it down?

      Pole continues to read.

                              POLE
                 That is not for me to decide...

      He brings out a pouch of coins, and tosses it across
      the table.

                              POLE (CONT'D)
                 Your service to his lordship is once
                 again greatly appreciated.

      Marlowe takes the pouch of money.

                            ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)
               He butchered you!


69   INT. CECIL HOUSE - WILLIAM CECIL'S STUDY - DAY             69

     Robert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front
     of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk.

     William Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill,
     and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels
     attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan
     wheelchair.

                            ROBERT CECIL
               Not only in front of Court! But the
               entire City as well! We must arrest
               this Shakespeare and-

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               No, Robert, think. If he is really as
               popular as you say, we would only
               anger the mob. No. We must strike at
               Edward directly.

     William Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from
     his chair as--

                            ROBERT CECIL
               But we cannot maintain our authority
               if the mob thinks us laughing stocks--

                            WILLIAM CECIL
                      (angry)
               Our authority comes from Elizabeth and
               from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is
               the key to all.

     Robert Cecil looks hurt by his father's anger.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                      (gentler)
               Robert... You must think deeper. You
               must compensate. Compensate for
               your... malformations... with the
               gifts God did grant you... With
               cunning. With ruthlessness.

     William Ceci pushes a hidden button on the side of his
     desk-- a spring loaded secret drawer POPS open. Robert
     Cecil has never seen it before.

     Cecil produces a folded piece of parchment from the
     drawer, offers it to Robert Cecil.

                                                               73
                                                        pg. 74


                             WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                From King James of Scotland.

      Robert Cecil looks surprised.


69A   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                 69A

      Robert Cecil is pushing William Cecil in his
      wheelchair. They are completely alone.

                              WILLIAM CECIL
                James knows of the Queen's affection
                for Essex... and the rumors of his
                birth. He is justly concerned.
                       (beat)
                You will reply to him.

                             ROBERT CECIL
                I will reply to him?

                             WILLIAM CECIL
                I am dying, Robert--
                       (before Robert can
                        protest)
                We both know this to be true. And I
                will not witness the next coronation.


69B   INT. CECIL HOUSE - WILLIAM CECIL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS       69B
      LATER

      Robert Cecil wheels his father in.

                             WILLIAM CECIL
                Help me to my bed, my son.
                       (Robert Cecil does so)
                If we are to secure your place at the
                side of the next king, you must get
                that king his throne, not I.

      A beat as this registers on Robert Cecil.

                              WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                You will write to James that I am
                gravely ill, but that all is in hand.
                Much of the Privy Council has already
                secretly agreed to his ascension to
                the English throne due to your
                tireless, but secret, entreaties on
                his behalf.
                       (beat)
                And then tell him Essex will not
                return from Ireland alive.

                                                                 74
                                                         pg. 75


     Robert Cecil looks surprised.

                             WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               This is how kings are made, Robert.
               So it was with Elizabeth, and so it
               shall ever be. There were many rival
               claims to her throne, but none
               survived to make their claim. James
               must know that you will do the same
               for him, and he will reward you for
               it.
                      (beat)
               But we must do one thing more...

     William Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass
     vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               Like Essex, Edward must be removed.

                            ROBERT CECIL
                      (confused)
               Edward?

     William Cecil is slowly falling asleep...

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               He uses the tools at his disposal, as
               we use the tools at ours. But ours
               will win... as they always have.

                            ROBERT CECIL
                      (more confused)
               I-- I don't understand, father.    What
               does Edward--

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Edward seeks what we seek.   To choose
               the next King.

     Off Robert Cecil's surprised face we hear:

                            YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
               I am with child...

                                                          CUT TO:


70   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - LONG GALLERY - DUSK                      70

     Twenty seven years earlier. Young Elizabeth is pacing,
     terribly agitated. Bessie, the lady-in-waiting we have
     seen constantly at her side is the only other person
     present.

                                                                    75
                                                 pg. 76


                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Are you certain?

Young Elizabeth turns to Bessie.

                       BESSIE
          Two cycles have passed, my lord.

William Cecil thinks.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          I wish to marry him...

William Cecil looks startled.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Marry him, your grace? He is already
          married.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          I can do what I will.

                        WILLIAM CECIL
          Can you?

She gives him a sharp look.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          Most of the Catholic princes of Europe
          wish to topple you and end your
          Protestant reign... The only things
          that stop them are the channel, and
          the hope that they might marry you,
          and thereby achieve your realm through
          other means.

Young Elizabeth hears him, thinks on it, then begins
pacing again.

                       YOUNG ELIZABETH
          I love him...

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          Would you risk your throne for him?
          Would you risk England for him?

He knows the answer to that.

                       WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          We must do as we have done before...
          You must go on Progress, somewhere
          isolated, accompanied by only those
          whom you most trust.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               After the birth, I will find a
               suitable house for the child to be
               reared in.

     Young Elizabeth is uncertain.

                             YOUNG ELIZABETH
               And Edward?

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               He must never know.


71   INT. CECIL HOUSE - PRIVATE CHAPEL - DAY                   71

     A simple, cold space, like William Cecil himself.
     William Cecil is alone in prayer. A few beats, then he
     senses he is not alone. He turns and sees Young Oxford
     (still 20).

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               What have you done?

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               I am praying.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
                      (ignoring him)
               She won't see me! I've gone to her
               chambers three times, and she will not
               receive me. And now she's gone!

     William Cecil regards Young Oxford for a beat, then
     stands.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               She's on Progress.

     With this he leaves the chapel.


72   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                   72

     Young Oxford runs after him.

                             YOUNG OXFORD
               Where?   Where did she go?

     William Cecil is silent.

                            YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
               What did you say to her? Tell me!



                                                              77
                                                      pg. 78


                            WILLIAM CECIL
               The Queen does not ask for my advice
               about matters of the heart, Edward.
               If she had, she hardly would have
               chosen you for her pleasure.

     He has a point.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               You must have known her eye would move
               elsewhere, Edward. It always has.
               You are neither the first, nor the
               last, of her lovers.

     Young Oxford looks up at him like a bucket of cold
     water has hit him.

     William Cecil stops. He looks at Oxford with a stern
     face.

                            WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
               Go back to my daughter, Edward. She
               will accept you with open arms, as she
               always has. Behave as your great
               title demands you behave. Tend to
               your estates, your investments.
                      (a beat)
               And make me a grandson, an heir!

     Off Young Oxford's pained expression.

                                                        CUT TO:


73   INT. MERMAID'S TAVERN - NIGHT                                 73

     Twenty-seven years later. Jonson is alone, trying to
     write at a small table, though it's obvious from his
     fits and starts and crossing outs that he is having
     difficulty.

                            MARLOWE (O.S.)
               It's difficult to write, isn't it?
               After watching something like
               "Hamlet"...

     Jonson looks up. Marlowe sits, uninvited.    Jonson
     looks annoyed at the interruption.

                            MARLOWE (CONT'D)
               I've seen you watch him. Will.
               During a performance. It eats at
               you... at your soul...


                                                                  78
                                                  pg. 79


Jonson stares at him, his answer obvious.

                       MARLOWE (CONT'D)
          Why do you think Will hasn't been
          arrested? You or I make the slightest
          joke about a nobleman of no
          consequence, and we find ourselves in
          a cell quicker than a fart spreads in
          the trade winds. Will-- he murders a
          caricature of old William Cecil
          himself, and still whores all the way
          to Westminster and back.

                       JONSON
                 (shrugs)
          Perhaps they haven't noticed..

Jonson gets up and walks towards the door.

                       MARLOWE
          I made sure they did...

Jonson turns around.

                       JONSON
          You informed on one of your own?   To
          the Tower?

                       MARLOWE
          Watch who you judge, Ben, for as God
          is my witness, you may well find
          yourself doing the same before you
          meet your maker. We do what we have
          to, to survive, and survive well, in
          this life. All of us. And Will is
          definitely not one of us. You know
          he's illiterate, don't you?

Jonson is stunned.

                       MARLOWE (CONT'D)
          No? Oh, he can read well enough-- how
          else could he learn his lines? But
          the man never actually learned to form
          his letters.

                       JONSON
          Why are you here, Kit?

                       MARLOWE
                 (smiles)
          So who did write it? You?   No.    You'd
          take credit for it. No...
                       (MORE)

                                                          pg. 80

                             MARLOWE (CONT'D)
                It must be someone who wants their
                anonymity protected. Someone who
                might even pay to have it protected.

      Jonson is getting nervous.

                               MARLOWE (CONT'D)
                A nobleman.

      Jonson looks up.   Marlowe smiles, knowing he is closer
      to the truth.

                               MARLOWE (CONT'D)
                But which?    You know, don't you, Ben?

                             JONSON
                You've had too much to drink, Kit.
                You're beginning to sound like one of
                your plays.

      Jonson stands and hurries out of the Tavern.


73A   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON    - MOMENTS LATER                      73A

      Jonson heads down the street, Marlowe chasing after
      him.

                             MARLOWE
                Ben! Tell me. We can go to him
                together. Guarantee his anonymity...
                for a price.

                             JONSON
                You reported on me as well, didn't
                you, Kit? Last year. That's why I
                was arrested, wasn't it? Because you
                went to the Tower?

                             MARLOWE
                       (lying)
                Ben, Ben... I had nothing to do with
                that.

      Jonson studies Marlowe for a beat and then walks away.

                             MARLOWE (CONT'D)
                Ben-- I'll just go to Will! He'll
                tell me because he has so much more to
                lose than you. Fame. Fortune. And
                you'll profit nothing from it.
                Nothing!

      But Jonson is gone.

                                                                   80

74   EXT. MILITARY CAMP - IRELAND - DAY                         74

     A military encampment with dozens of tents on a cliff
     by the Irish seaside.

     CLOSER

     Essex's tent is larger, and guarded. An OLD SERVANT
     carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches. A
     guard opens the tent for him to enter.


     INT. ESSEX'S TENT - CONTINUOUS

     Essex is having a Council of War with his generals and
     senior officers, including Southampton. They all stand
     around a table, consulting a map of Ireland.

                            ESSEX
                      (pointing)
               If the Rebels have stripped the
               northern borders... Then we must
               march south... and take Cahir
               Castle...

     The SERVANT stays in the background as he pours wine
     into various goblets. Southampton notices him-- the
     servant's hand shakes as he pours the wine.

                            GENERAL
                      (clears throat,
                       uncomfortable)
               My lord. `Tis a well-defended
               fortress.    Two thousand men at
               least. We cannot--

     Southampton notices the Servant's shaking hand slipping
     into a pocket as--

                            ESSEX
               So what would you have me do? Spend
               the entire spring encamped? I am sent
               to Ireland to end this infernal
               rebellion, not idle my days with--

                            SOUTHAMPTON
               Robert!

     In an instant Southampton draws a silver engraved
     pistol and SHOOTS the servant!

     Everyone is shocked-- but then we see:



                                                               81
                                                     pg. 82


     THE SERVANT

     had drawn his own, small wooden pistol.

     ESSEX

     shares a look with Southampton.


75   EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                           75

     To Establish. A foggy day. In the Foreground we see
     the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU
     (20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with
     rapiers for exercise.

     CLOSER

     They wear outfits that are slightly more protective
     than ornamental.

     They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES
     Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French.

                             BEAULIEU
               Point!

     Oxford backs off, as does the fencing master.

                            OXFORD
                      (in French)
               Bien. Faisons du travail... le Coup
               droit d'autorité?

                            BEAULIE
               Mais oui, mon seigneur.

                              OXFORD
               Bien.    En garde!

     And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly
     surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more
     aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but
     is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well.

     And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS
     Oxford in the leg.

                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
               Qu'est ce que vous faites?

     But Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu
     continues his attack.


                                                               82
                                                       pg. 83


                              OXFORD (CONT'D)
               Beaulieu?    Beaulieu?!

     This has become an assassination attempt, not an
     exercise.

     ENTRANCE OF THE MAZE

     Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray
     carrying a pitcher and two goblets.

     CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Though wounded, Oxford is a superior swordsman. And he
     begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises
     Beaulieu.

     IN THE MAZE

     Francesco heads for the center as--

     IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Oxford PIERCES Beaulieu's heart with his rapier, and
     Beaulieu SCREAMS--

     IN THE MAZE

     Francesco hears the scream, and starts to run.

                              FRANCESCO
               Signor?    Signor?!

     IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Oxford collapses as Francesco rushes in.

                           FRANCESCO (CONT'D)
               Signor? Mio dio! Signor! What has
               happened--

     Oxford checks his leg wound, and glances at the dead
     Beaulieu. He tries to wave off Franceso's aid, but to
     no avail as--

                            OXFORD
               Beaulieu-- he, he tried to kill me...


76   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                  76

     Jonson, slightly drunk, walks down a street, a whore
     under his arm, and notices a commotion up ahead: people
     talking by an alley near the Mermaid's tavern.

                                                                83
                                                    pg. 84


                            JONSON
                      (to a passer-by)
               What's all that, then?

                            MAN
               A body...

     Jonson peers over and sees:

     A BODY

     on its back in the alley. Someone turns it over.    It's
     MARLOWE, a dried stab-wound in his eye.

     JONSON

     is stunned.

                            MAN (CONT'D)
               Must have been a cut-purse. Nowhere's
               bloody safe anymore, I'll tell you
               that...

                                                       CUT TO:


77   INT. A BEAR-BAITING THEATER - DAY                            77

     A small, open air theater where a chained bear is being
     led around the theater. A set of mastiffs are being
     led on the opposite side of the theater.

     The spectators are unruly, loudly making bets for the
     mauling to come.

     Jonson is among them, taking a look at the bear, deciding
     whether to bet on it or not.

                            BEAR BAITER
               Sampson! Sired by the great Arthur
               himself! No dog's yet been bred that can
               take him down!

     Shakespeare suddenly sits next Jonson hardly notices.

                            SHAKESPEARE
               I need more money.

                            JONSON
               More--? You already make more than any
               playwright Bankside.




                                                                 84
                                                 pg. 85


                       BEAR BAITER
          But then here, good friends, I bring you
          a pack of dogs so fierce, so dangerous,
          that Medusa herself would shrink in fear!

                       SHAKESPEARE
          I'm going to build my own theater, Ben,
          one that fits the scale of my work--

Jonson suddenly turns to him.

                        JONSON
          Your work?

                       BEAR BAITER
          Not a one has had a morsel of food in a
          week! Bred by the great John Sinclow!

                       A MAN
          Fourpence on three dogs!

                       SHAKESPEARE
          They insist only a gentleman can own the
          land.

                       ANOTHER MAN
          A shilling on four!

                       SHAKESPEARE
          The bribes are outrageous, but I found
          some one who will make me a coat-of-arms,
          and change the Stratford lists for me.

                        JONSON
          Impossible.

                       ANOTHER MAN
          Eight shillings on six dogs!   Eight
          shillings on six dogs!

                       JONSON
          I'll take that bet!!   Eight shillings on
          the bear, six dogs!

                        ANOTHER MAN
          Done!

                       SHAKESPEARE
          Bad bet, that.

                       JONSON
                 (to Shakespeare)
          You'll have to make do with what
          you've got. I won't be your beggar.

                                                          85
                                                      pg. 86


Shakespeare gives him a look to kill.

                          SHAKESPEARE
             This isn't a request, Ben.   I'll have
             more money.

                          JONSON
             Or what? You'll slit my throat like
             you did Kit's?

                          MAN
             Release the dogs!   Release the dogs!

Shakespeare shows no reaction.

                          JONSON
             I know he went to see you last night,
             Will. And I know he was planning to
             expose you if you didn't agree to his
             terms.

IN THE PIT

The bear baiting begins.

WIDER

Shakespeare stares at Jonson.

                          SHAKESPEARE
                    (dead serious)
             You're mad, Ben. Kit was my friend.

                          JONSON
             Be careful, Will. You kill me off
             too, and you won't have any good plays
             to act in after this is all done.

Some of the spectators BOO while others CHEER, and--

                          SHAKESPEARE
             I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or
             another, I'll have my guineas.

And he gets up and leaves as the--

DOGS

start to go for the bear's throat.     Thge cheering goes to
a roar as we--

                                                       pg. 87


      SHAKESPEARE

      Wears a beard and fake nose. He tries to stay hidden so
      Jonson doesn't see him. We are:


78    EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                      78

      Jonson is waiting not far from him by a stand and
      drinks an ale.

      Then Oxford's servant, Francesco, appears.

      After the two men have exchanged couple of words,
      Francesco gives Jonson a leather folder containing a
      manuscript and a purse jingling with coin. Jonson
      takes them and leaves.

      Jonson safely gone, Shakespeare starts to follow
      Francesco who heads back over the bridge.


78A   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DUSK                                 78A

      Shakespeare is in a small boat following Francesco, who
      is in Oxford's boat. They head towards Oxford Stone.


      EXT. OXFORD STONE - DUSK

      Shakespeare watches as Francesco enters Oxford Stone.


79    OMIT                                                          79

80    INT. OXFORD STONE - STUDY - DUSK                              80

      Shakespeare is waiting, clearly uncomfortable. It's
      not the kind of room he's used to being in. He holds
      his wig and his nose.

      A door opens, and Oxford enters, walking on a stick
      because of his leg injury. He is followed by his
      servant, Francesco.

                             OXFORD
                So! You are the famous Shakespeare
                whose labors I have enjoyed so much.
                I am at your service, sir.



                                                                   87
                                                 pg. 88


Shakespeare is uncomfortable. He wasn't expecting
Oxford himself. Then he just goes for it.

                       SHAKESPEARE
          My lord-- I- I need more money.

                       OXFORD
                 (sharp)
          I beg your pardon?

                       SHAKESPEARE
          My expenses have, ah, aggrandized...
          since this all began.

                       OXFORD
          "Aggrandized"?

                       SHAKESPEARE
          And if, if your lordship doesn't agree
          to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall
          be forced to make certain... facts
          public.

                       FRANCESCO
          Have you any idea to whom you are
          speaking?

                       SHAKESPEARE
          I am addressing the writer of
          Hamlet... of Juliet and her Romeo.   Am
          I not?

Oxford is silent. Francesco goes to physically eject
Shakespeare from the room.

                      FRANCESCO
          Out. Get out! How dare you insult my
          master in--

                          OXFORD
          Wait!
                 (beat)
          How much?

Shakespeare looks at Francesco, then Oxford.

                       SHAKESPEARE
          Four hundred pounds. A year.

                          FRANCESCO
          A year?

                          OXFORD
          Pay him.

     Francesco is shocked.

                            OXFORD (CONT'D)
                      (impatient, in Italian)
               Pagalo!

     Shakespeare smiles.


81   EXT. OXFORD STONE - DUSK                                   81

     Shakespeare exits, tossing a leather pouch filled with
     coins. He smiles.


82   INT. OXFORD STONE - STUDY - DUSK                           82

     Oxford watches Shakespeare walk down the road through a
     window.

                            FRANCESCO
               Forgive me for speaking of things
               above my place or understanding,
               signor. But... Is this wise? They
               have already tried to kill you once.

                            OXFORD
               Wisdom, Francesco, is a quality I have
               unfortunately never possessed...

     Francesco stares at Oxford who is deep in thought.

     The sound of heated love making takes us to...


83   INT. CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT          83

     Twenty-five years earlier. Young Oxford (now 25 and
     with a beard) is making love to someone. We can't tell
     who at first, and assume it is Elizabeth. And then we
     see, it's BESSIE, Young Elizabeth's lady-in-waiting.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


84   INT. CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT          84

     An hour later, post-coital. A fire is burning, and
     Bessie is finishing dressing herself.

                            BESSIE
               Edward... You know she would be
               furious if she found out about this...


                                                               89

      Young Oxford doesn't answer. He is deep in thought.

                             BESSIE (CONT'D)
                She still loves you.

                              YOUNG OXFORD
                No.   She abandoned me.

                             BESSIE
                You don't know, do you?

      He looks at her quizzically.

                              BESSIE (CONT'D)
                The Queen.   She had your child.


85    EXT. CECIL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING                           85

      A carriage drives towards the house.


85A   INT. CARRIAGE - EARLY MORNING                             85A

      Young Anne de Vere holds her sleeping daughter in her
      arms.


86    INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING                 86

      Bessie carefully closes Oxford's bedroom door and
      suddenly freezes.

      She turns and sees Young Oxford's wife with her little
      daughter at her side standing in the hallway staring at
      her.

      For a moment nobody dares to move, then Bessie rushes
      off...

                             WILLIAM CECIL
                I cannot be certain, majesty, when
                the... relationship began.

                                                      CUT TO:


87    INT. RICHMOND PALACE - GREAT HALL - DAY                    87

      Young Elizabeth looks out a window, obviously
      distressed. William Cecil is across from her, his face
      tense.



                                                                90
                                                       pg. 91


                             WILLIAM CECIL
                But sometime soon after your return to
                Court.

                               YOUNG ELIZABETH
                You're sure?

                             WILLIAM CECIL
                They-- they haven't been very
                discreet, majesty. I presume he
                wanted you to know. To... to hurt
                you.

      She is crushed.

                             WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
                Majesty, there is more. The lady is
                pregnant.

      Young Elizabeth freezes, stunned.   Then--

                               YOUNG ELIZABETH
                Arrest them.    Arrest them both!

      William Cecil bows and exits.

      Now alone, Young Elizabeth lets her emotions out.   She
      picks up a vase and THROWS it into a wall.


87A   EXT. TOWER OF LONDON - DAY                                87A

      From high above, we see a carriage arrive.    It stops,
      and William Cecil gets out.


88    INT. TOWER OF LONDON - YOUNG OXFORD'S CELL - DAY           88

      Young Oxford (now 26) is looking out a window at the
      river beyond. He has been imprisoned for some months.
      His beard has become ragged, his clothes have seen
      better days.

      William Cecil enters.

                             WILLIAM CECIL
                Your whore gave birth last week.

      Young Oxford turns to William Cecil. The stare at each
      other for a beat.




                                                                91
                                                   pg. 92


                        WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
          The Queen has decided to release you.
          It seems time does indeed heal all
          wounds.
                 (beat)
          These are her conditions for your
          release. One. You will not
          acknowledge the child. Two. You will
          never see the mother again. Three.
          You will avoid Court at all costs.
          Her majesty would prefer not to be
          reminded of you in any way ever again.

A beat as Young Oxford thinks on all this.

                         YOUNG OXFORD
          Banished...?

                        WILLIAM CECIL
          No. You have the freedom of the
          kingdom. Just not of the Court.
                 (beat)
          Those are her terms. Here are mine.
          You will go back to my daughter. You
          will make some effort to make her
          happy and you will finally act
          according to your station in life, and
          accept the responsibilities of your
          great title.

Oxford reluctantly NODS.    William Cecil goes to leave.

                          YOUNG OXFORD
          My lord!     I, too, have a condition.

William Cecil turns.

                       YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
          I will go back to your daughter if...
          You tell me the name of the child.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          I don't know if the whore has even
          delivered the--

                        YOUNG OXFORD
          No.   The other one.

Cecil's face goes to stone.

                       WILLIAM CECIL
          The other one?
                 (realizing)
          Who told you?

                                                            92
                                                       pg. 93


     Cecil is obviously annoyed by this development.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
               I will go back to your daughter. I
               will make you as many grandchildren as
               she can bare...

     William Cecil thinks.

                            YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
               Or I can remain here...

     William Cecil decides.

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               There is no record of his true birth,
               no trail that leads to you, or the...
               mother. His foster parents never knew
               the truth, and both are now dead...

                              YOUNG OXFORD
               The name?

                            WILLIAM CECIL
               Make even a hint of this to the child,
               or anyone else, and this agreement is
               void, and I'll see your head on the
               block within a fortnight. And the
               boy's as well.

                            YOUNG OXFORD
                      (excited)
               It's a boy...?


89   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY                             89

     Young Oxford (cleaned up) is watching a BOY about five
     years old dueling with a tutor. The boy is quite good.

     The boy notices Young Oxford, and stops duelling.

                              BOY
               Hello...

                              YOUNG OXFORD
               Hello.

     Young Oxford smiles at the boy.

                            YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
               I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.



                                                                93

                              BOY
                 My lord...

     The Boy bows, a serious expression on his face.

                              YOUNG OXFORD
                 They tell me one day you're to be an
                 Earl as well.

                              BOY
                 I shall be the Earl of Southampton.

                              YOUNG OXFORD
                        (smiling)
                 Well then, we shall be Earls together,
                 shan't we?

90   INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                                    90

     Twenty-five years later. William Cecil's body is in
     state, in his coffin, in the center of the apse.

     ELIZABETH

     looking completely stricken, approaches the coffin,
     holding Cecil's white cane. She places it at his side.

     In the background we hear the Archbishop of Canterbury
     reading from the bible.

                              ARCHBISHOP (O.S.)
                 ... In the sweat of thy face shalt
                 thou eat bread, till thou return to
                 the earth: for out of it wast thou
                 taken, because thou art dust, and to
                 dust shalt thou return...

     ROBERT CECIL

     scans the room, to see how it is all playing out.

     OXFORD

     watches stoically, his wife and children at his side.




                                                                    94

91   EXT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                                91

     The funeral over, Elizabeth exits the portal of
     Westminster Abbey and heads to her carriage. A huge
     crowd of mourners has assembled.

     Robert Cecil steps into place right behind her.

                            ELIZABETH
               We wish to recall Essex from
               Ireland...

     Robert Cecil is instantly concerned, but hides it well.
     They continue to walk.

                            ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
               We feel a terrible void, now that your
               father is no longer at our side...

     Robert Cecil bows his head as he walks.

                            ROBERT CECIL
               A wise decision, your majesty. If
               nothing else, it will give him an
               opportunity to respond to all these
               rumors.

     Still walking, she turns to him sharply.

                             ELIZABETH
               Rumors?

                            ROBERT CECIL
               I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd
               heard.

                             ELIZABETH
               Heard what?

                            ROBERT CECIL
               Essex is in negotiations with Philip
               of Spain...

                            ELIZABETH
               Peace is at hand. We know this.

                            ROBERT CECIL
               Majesty-- it is said that Essex has
               promised Phillip all of Catholic
               Ireland in return for...

     He hesitates.



                                                                95

                            ELIZABETH
               In return for what?

                            ROBERT CECIL
               Spain's support of Essex's claim to
               the throne of England...

     They have arrived at her carriage.

                             ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
                      (beat)
               It is, as of yet, just rumor.

                            ELIZABETH
               Bring him to me, William.   Bring him
               to me at once!

                            ROBERT CECIL
                      (correcting)
               Robert, majesty.

     Elizabeth stares at him for an instant, then gets into
     her carriage, unsure of herself.

                            ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
               My father's death has been a great
               loss for us all...

     She ignores him, trying to collect herself. Robert
     Cecil turns to the driver, NODS, and the carriage takes
     off.

     As soon as it is away, Robert Cecil turns and some in
     the crowd of commoners begin to BOO at him.

     HORSE HOOVES

     as they gallop over emerald green grasses.   We are:


92   EXT. A MILITARY FIELD IN IRELAND - DAY                        92

     A group of horsemen gallop into Essex's camp. A
     MESSENGER jumps off his horse and heads for Essex's
     tent.


93   INT. ESSEX'S TENT - DAY                                       93

     Where Essex and Southampton are having dinner as the
     messenger enters. He bows.

               My lord...

     He hands him a sealed envelope. Essex takes it, begins
     to read. Frowns, SLAMS the parchment down. He looks
     into the distance, trying to process what he's just
     read.

     Southampton picks up the parchment and begins reading.

                            SOUTHAMPTON
               She can't believe this...

                            ESSEX
               Oh, can't she?

                            SOUTHAMPTON
               It's Robert Cecil. He failed to kill
               you, now he tries to kill your name.

     Essex heads for the flap of the tent.

                            ESSEX
               We leave with the tide!

94   INT. THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - NIGHT                             94

     Shakespeare enters the tavern carrying a rolled up
     parchment. He passes various actors drinking, then
     hurries over to Jonson, Nashe and Dekker, who are deep
     in drink.

                            SHAKESPEARE
               Well, I've got it!

     Shakespeare unravels the parchment.   He puts it on the
     table with a flourish.

     It shows a coat-of-arms containing a spear and a
     falcon. The colors are numerous, and garish.

                            SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
               The herald just finished it not an
               hour ago.
                      (smiles)
               Well?

     Everyone is confused by it.

                            NASHE
               It's quite... colorful.

          What in blazes is it?

                       SHAKESPEARE
          My coat-of-arms! It cost a bloody
          fortune, but, by god, you can call me
          gentleman now!

Jonson looks over at Shakespeare. Shakespeare locks
eyes with him, but looks away, ashamed of something.

                       DEKKER
          I can't quite make out the motto...
          Non sanz... Non...

          You went to him, didn't you? You
          lying knave-- you went to him!

Shakespeare doesn't want to discuss this with the
others present.

                        SHAKESPEARE
                  (smiles)
          Ben.   Ben! Let me buy you a--

He grabs Jonson's shoulder, but Jonson pushes him away.

                      JONSON
          What? You've already killed off one
          competitor. Now you want another dead
          as well?

Shakespeare looks at the confused Nashe and Dekker
nervously.

                       SHAKESPEARE
          I don't know what you mean.   Ben, we
          should really--

                       JONSON
          I swore to him I wouldn't tell you his
          name. Swore it! Do you have any idea
          what he might do to me? Do you?
                 (to Nashe)

                            JONSON (CONT'D)
               He's not even a writer you know. He
               can't even--

                            SHAKESPEARE
               Ben-- you've had too much to drink.

     Shakespeare grabs Jonson.

                            JONSON
               Unhand me!

     Shakespeare backs off. Jonson pulls out a piece of
     parchment from his shirt.

                            JONSON (CONT'D)
               Here!
                      (looks around)
               A quill! A quill!

     Nashe and Dekker look at each other, slightly
     embarrassed. Jonson finds a quill deep in his pants.
     He thrusts it at Will, who ignores it.

                            JONSON (CONT'D)
                      (re: the parchment)
               Go on, Will. Write something for us.
               Now. Go on! Amaze us with your
               verse. Your wit! No? Try astounding
               us with the letter "E". Or an "I"--
               it's just a straight line!

     Shakespeare stares at him.

                            SHAKESPEARE
               You haven't got any ink.

     And he exits.

                                                      CUT TO:


95   EXT. THE CITY GATES OF LONDON - DAY                         95

     Southampton and Essex are on horseback, followed by
     several dozen armed retainers, GALLOPING towards the
     city of London.


96   EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                     96

     The party rides into the first gate. The palace is the
     city residence of the Queen, and is at the edge of the
     City.


                                                                99
                                                      pg. 100


     Essex and Southampton jump off their horses.


97   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY                        97

     Essex and Southampton walk quickly down the long
     hallway, opening door after door. Servants scurry
     behind them, terrified of the intrusion, trying to stop
     them. They open the doors into--


98   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY               98

     The ladies-in-waiting scream in fear when they see the
     two men in battle gear.

                            ESSEX
                      (to Southampton)
               Wait for me.

     And he continues on into--


99   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM -            99
     CONTINUOUS

     --where Elizabeth is still dressing, putting on make-
     up, etc. She is NOT wearing her wig, and is only
     wearing her undergarments. She looks quite ugly.

     She turns to see Essex, shocked at his intrusion.

     Essex FREEZES.   He knows he has just made an enormous
     faux-pas.

                            ESSEX
               Majesty, I, I...

     She stares at him, horrified to be seen in such a
     manner. The she regains her composure and--

                             ELIZABETH
               Get out!   Out!!!

     He steps back in horror-- not at her appearance, but
     what he has just done. The doors SLAM in front of him
     as we--

                            ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                            (CONT'D)
               The insolence!




                                                                100
                                                       pg. 101


100   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY              100

      Elizabeth, now dressed and wearing her wig on her
      throne, is raging at Robert Cecil.

                             ELIZABETH
                Who in God's name does he think he is?
                Abandoning his post without my leave!

      She begins to absent-mindedly unbutton the top of her
      bodice.

                             ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                Coming into our presence in such a
                manner, neither announced nor invited,
                half his army in my courtyard. He's
                gone mad... mad!

                             ROBERT CECIL
                No. Unfortunately for us, your
                majesty, he is quite sane. He simply
                believes he is your royal equal.

      She turns to him sharply, furious at the thought.


101   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                      101

      It looks like an armed camp, with part of Essex's army
      encamped in the front courtyard. The soldiers are all
      tense.

      Oxford, followed only by Francesco, rides into the
      courtyard. He is immediately surrounded by armed men,
      their muskets pointed at him. Oxford raises his hands.

                             OXFORD
                I am Edward, Earl of Oxford.

                              SOUTHAMPTON
                Edward!   Edward! Thank god you're
                here.

      Southampton comes towards him.

                             SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D)
                Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal
                licenses! She believes every lie
                Cecil tells about him.
                       (seeing Oxford's wound)
                Edward? What happened to your leg?




                                                                 101
                                                        pg. 102


                             OXFORD
                       (shrugs)
                Nothing.

      Oxford continues towards the door. Southampton
      follows, his concern for Oxford's wound noticeable.


102   INT. ESSEX HOUSE - HALL - DAY                                102

      Oxford, Southampton and Essex are alone. Oxford is
      sitting in a chair, while Essex paces impatiently,
      Southampton standing between them.

                             ESSEX
                She won't accept my letters. I cannot
                get to her. Cecil plans to arrest me
                any day. I know it.
                       (beat and more determined)
                But that won't be as easy as he
                thinks.

                             OXFORD
                Fight him in London, and you only
                validate every rumor and lie Cecil has
                ever told about you.

                             ESSEX
                Then what do you suggest I do? Let
                myself be arrested so I can be tried
                and executed for crimes I did not
                commit?

                            OXFORD
                No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself,
                alone--

                             ESSEX
                How? Cecil won't let her see a letter
                without reading it first.

                             OXFORD
                I won't send her a letter.   I will
                send her a book.

      Essex looks confused, but Oxford ignores it.

                             OXFORD (CONT'D)
                She will call for me. And while I am
                with her, you will come-- not with an
                army, not with swords, but with her
                loyal subjects. The cobblers, the
                tinkers, the bricklayers of London.

                                                         pg. 103

                              OXFORD (CONT'D)
                 All, all calling for Robert Cecil's
                 banishment from Court. Words, Robert,
                 words, will prevail with her, not
                 swords.

       Essex looks unsure.

                                ESSEX
                 And the mob?    How will I--

                              OXFORD
                 Leave that to me.

103A   INT. OXFORD STONE - A STUDY - NIGHT                         103A

       Oxford is in his rooms, writing feverishly by
       candlelight.

       He completes a thought... closes the manuscript...
       writes down the title with a flourish:

       The Tragedie of Richard III


104    INT. A ROOM ABOVE THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - DAY                 104

       A room for the whores to take their tricks.    Small,
       with nothing much beyond a straw bed.

       Shakespeare is bedding a buxom young lady.

       And then the door OPENS. Francesco enters, and Oxford
       follows, holding a manuscript. Shakespeare looks
       shocked. She starts to SCREAM and yell as she pulls a
       sheet to cover herself.

                              FRANCESCO
                        (to the whore)
                 Hold your tongue, whore, and get out!

       She does so as Oxford walks over to Shakespeare. He
       tosses the manuscript to him. Shakespeare starts to
       look at it. The whore is partially dressed, so--

                              FRANCESCO (CONT'D)
                        (to the whore)
                 Out, woman!

                               WHORE
                 Oi.   `Oo's going to pay me then?

                                                                   103
                                                        pg. 104


      Shakespeare gives a look to Oxford-- he certainly isn't
      going to pay for it.

      Oxford nods to Francesco, who gives the whore a few
      coins. She smiles, and leaves.

                             OXFORD
                You shall begin rehearsals
                immediately. But it is not to be
                performed until I tell you. And you
                may only have a day's notice.

      Shakespeare looks confused.

                             SHAKESPEARE
                That will be expensive-- keeping all
                the actors ready. Having the props
                made but not--

      Oxford tosses a very large pouch of coins at him, and
      then begins to leave.

                             OXFORD
                Oh, and congratulations. You've had
                an epic poem published today.

                             SHAKESPEARE
                       (confused)
                Published? You mean like in a book?

      Renaissance MUSIC BEGINS as we--

                                                         CUT TO:

      A PIECE OF PAPER

      page is printed in front of us. It's called "Venus and
      Adonis". A MONTAGE BEGINS.


105   INT. A PRINT SHOP - DAY                                      105

      And the printer brings the page out from the press and
      checks it for proper alignment.

                             SHAKESPEARE (V.O.)
                `The boar!' quoth she; whereat a
                sudden pale,
                Like lawn being spread upon the
                blushing rose...
                Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his

                 throws:

       The printer nods his approval...   The poem continues
       with:


105A   EXT. THE PRINT SHOP - DAY                                  105A

       Shakespeare exits the Print Shop, continuing to read
       the book, now out-loud.

                              SHAKESPEARE (V.O.)
                 She sinketh down, still hanging by his
                 neck,
                 He on her belly falls, she on her
                 back.
                        (not quoting)
                 Oh, I like this...

       A LADY-IN-WAITING is reading out loud to other Ladies.
       They listen giggling now and then. We only see them
       from the back.

                              LADY IN WAITING
                 Graze on my lips; and if those hills
                 be dry,

      They all stand abruptly, worried. The women who was
      reading the book puts it down on a table.

      Elizabeth silently walks over to them, and picks up the
      book. She opens it as we--

                                                           CUT TO:


108   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - DUSK                         108

      Robert Cecil walks down the long hall, heading for an
      audience with the queen. Two guards open a door,
      letting him into--


109   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DUSK         109

      Elizabeth is looking out the window. It's raining
      outside. She is NOT wearing her wig, not much make-up,
      and looks quite... odd.

      Robert Cecil enters.

                               ELIZABETH
                         (turns)
                  You find me disgusting, don't you?
                  Repugnant. Wrinkled?

                               ROBERT CECIL
                  You, you are the sun, majesty.   The
                  glory of--

                               ELIZABETH
                  Liar!

      Robert Cecil shuts his mouth.


                                                                   106
                                                 pg. 107


                        ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Is it so hard to believe that once I
          was young? That I was... beautiful?
          Your father knew me as such...
                 (beat)
          You have read the book?

She doesn't have to say which one. Robert Cecil sees a
copy of "Venus and Adonis" on a table. He NODS.

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          He writes to me. To remind me of that
          beauty. That love. How I... took
          him. How I... adored him...

Robert Cecil knows to be silent.   She looks out the
window.

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                 (throaty, sexually)
          Graze on my lips; and if those hills
          be dry,
          Stray lower, where the pleasant
          fountains lie...

She smiles seductively, transported in time.

                        ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I've been foolish. Proud. Yes. Too
          proud. Gloriana... The Virgin
          Queen... A statue. Bloodless.
                 (beat)
          "Thou wast begot; to beget is thy
          duty.
          By law of nature thou art bound to
          breed, That thine may live when thou
          thyself art dead"...
                 (beat)
          Your father told you of the child?

A beat.

                       ROBERT CECIL
                 (hint of a smile)
          Which one, your majesty?

Elizabeth's eyes flare in anger for an instant, then
she regains composure.

                         ELIZABETH
          His.   Mine.   He still lives?

Robert Cecil nods.


                                                           107
                                                  pg. 108


                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          He was well placed? A nobleman?

                       ROBERT CECIL
                 (hesitates)
          Yes... your majesty.

                          ELIZABETH
          Who?

Robert Cecil hesitates.

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I am your Queen! Now who is my son!!?

                       ROBERT CECIL
          His grace, the Earl of... Southampton,
          your majesty.

She seems surprised. Perhaps she was expecting Essex.
But then she smiles, and NODS in approval.

                       CECIL
          Majesty... You are not having doubts
          about James of Scotland succeeding
          you, are you?

Elizabeth goes into a rage.

                       ELIZABETH
          James?! He is the son of Mary! She
          plotted and schemed to steal the
          throne from under me! No son of hers
          will rule while a yet Tudor lives!

Robert Cecil is surprised by her fury. He bows his
head as Elizabeth tries to collect herself.

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I will decide what is best for my
          kingdom! Not you! Not you!!
                 (calmer)
          I have bid Edward to come to me on my
          return to London on Monday next. It
          is decided.

She says no more, the audience over. Robert Cecil
hesitates, and then she glares at him... He bows and
exits, the fury on his face plain.

Elizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window...




                                                            108

                              ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                        (sotto)
                 And so, in spite of death, I shall
                 survive,
                 In that, my likeness still is left
                 alive.

110    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                   110

       Ben Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He
       stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater.
       Workers are still painting the walls.

       He pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a
       performance of "Richard III" on Monday next.


110A   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                              110A

       Jonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new
       theater Shakespeare and Burbage have built.

       The actor Condell is on stage, rehearsing the character
       of "Gloucester". He walks on stage with a limp, and
       has a large hump on his back. He is a caricature of
       Robert Cecil.

                              "GLOUCESTER"
                        (in character)
                 But I, that am not shaped for sportive
                 tricks, nor made to court an amorous
                 looking-glass...

       Richard BURBAGE, the theater's stage manager, is
       watching his performance with Spencer and a group of
       actors.

       Jonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat.

                              "GLOUCESTER" (CONT'D)
                        (in character)
                 I, that am curtail'd of this fair
                 proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent
                 before my time into this breathing
                 world...

                              SPENCER
                 Good part, that...




                                                                109
                                                  pg. 110


                       "GLOUCESTER"
          ...and that so lamely and
          unfashionable that dogs bark at me as
          I halt by them.
                 (out of character)
          Is this wise?

                       BURBAGE
          It's only the one performance.   Go on!

                       "GLOUCESTER"
          I need a drink...

And "Gloucester" heads backstage.

                       JONSON
                 (to Burbage)
          Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful!
          The best Bankside! But only one
          performance? Is it that bad?

                       BURBAGE
          Hardly, it's Will's new play. Richard
          the Third. We've been hired to
          perform it free to the public.

                         JONSON
          Free?

                       BURBAGE
          Aye. Some anonymous nobleman paid for
          everything. God knows Will never
          would.   Been rehearsing all week,
          just found out this morning, we go up
          next Monday.

Jonson thinks a beat-- that's odd-- but then holds up
his manuscript.

                       JONSON
                 (grins)
          My best so far. I guarantee more than
          one performance. Though I'll not pay
          for the tickets myself.
                 (winks)
          No need to.

                       BURBAGE
          Sorry, Ben...

Jonson looks confused.




                                                            110
                                                          pg. 111


                             BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                Will... He's part owner... I'm sorry
                Ben, but I had to agree no Jonson
                plays at the Globe... Ever.

      Jonson is in shock.

                                                           CUT TO:


111   INT. THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - NIGHT                              111

      Jonson is deep in drink, by himself.   He listens as
      patrons of the bar say:

                             MAN
                       (to a woman)
                You doin' tomorrow?

                              WOMAN
                You askin?

                             MAN
                Managed to get two tickets to
                Shakespeare's latest. Cost me a
                fortune.

                             PASSING MAN
                Ballocks, did it! They're giving them
                away free.

      Some of the actors from the rehearsal enter, all jolly
      and excited. They head for the bar. They are: The
      ACTOR WHO PLAYED "GLOUCESTER", Spencer, Pope, Heminge,
      etc...

                             SPENCER
                Best villain in the history of
                theater, Richard the Third. No doubt.

                               HEMINGE
                Come on.    Better than Mephistopheles?

                             SPENCER
                No doubt! Your Marlowe-- god rest his
                soul-- is fine for your everyday
                scalawag, and your Jonson won't even
                try the hard drama. No, this is
                Shakespeare, for god's sake! The man
                knows drama. I tell you, not even the
                Greeks compare!
                       (toasting)
                To Shakespeare! And villainy!


                                                                    111
                                                        pg. 112


                             ALL
                To Shakespeare! And villainy!

      Jonson gets up, furious, and exits, quite drunk.     The
      actors don't even notice him.


112   EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON    - NIGHT           112

      Jonson stumbles down the streets, alone, deep in his
      own private hell. It's raining.

                             WHORE
                Fancy a tumble? Only sixpence!

      Jonson waves her off.     He looks up and sees:

      FROM HIS POV:

      The Tower of London. He makes a decision.


113   OMITTED                                                      113


114   INT. THE TOWER OF LONDON - POLE'S ROOM - DAY                 114

      Jonson sits in the same spot where Marlowe was sitting
      earlier. And he hates himself for it. Rain drips down
      the windows.

      Pole looks up from some papers.

                             POLE
                I haven't got all day, man.

                             JONSON
                I... There is a-- there is a play to
                be performed... on Monday.

                             POLE
                There's many plays to be performed
                next Monday, isn't there?

                              JONSON
                Yes, my lord, but this one is to be
                performed one performance, and one
                performance only. On Monday. All
                Bankside is talking of it.
                       (beat)
                The History of King Richard the Third.
                By William Shakespeare.

      Pole is confused.   So?

                                                                  112
                                                       pg. 113


                             JONSON (CONT'D)
                He kills his brother the king, and
                half the royal family to get the
                throne for himself--

                             POLE
                I know who Richard the Third was.

                             JONSON
                Yes. Of course you do. But in
                William Shakespeare's version, he is
                played as a hunch-back.

      Pole realizes this is significant.


115   INT. CECIL HOUSE - THE PRIVATE CHAPEL - DAWN                115

      Robert Cecil has prayed all night. His lips silently
      move in a prayer for a miracle.

      When Pole appears he doesn't stop his prayer. Only
      after Pole whispers in his ear does he stop and look
      slowly up to the simple cross and close his eyes in
      relief.


116   EXT. LONDON - DAY                                           116

      From high, high above a city of 200,000 souls. It's a
      beautiful sunny day, but black storm clouds are on the
      horizon.

      All of London is on its feet. They all are on their way
      to Bankside.

      The London Bridge is crammed one way. The River Thames
      is full of many small boats of theatergoers.


117   EXT. BANKSIDE - IN FRONT OF THE GLOBE - DAY                 117

      We see that a huge crowd has formed in front of the
      Globe.


118   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DAY                    118

      Everyone is busy, preparing for the performance;
      actors, stage-hands, etc...

      Shakespeare adjusts an actor's costume when Burbage
      walks up besides him.


                                                                 113
                                                          pg. 114


                               BURBAGE
                  We have to turn `em away by the
                  hundreds! Look! Never seen anything
                  quite like it!

        And both men look out the curtains to the crowd
        outside.

        The theater is full to the last seat. The people are
        crammed together like sardines.


118A    INT. OXFORD STONE - OXFORD'S ROOM - NIGHT                   118A

        Oxford is being dressed in front of a mirror...    His
        finest clothes... Powder to face...

        Francesco assists him.


118AA   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - THE GALLERIES - DAY             118AA

        Jonson is leaning against the edge of the balustrade,
        watching the Groundlings fill in. He bites his nails
        nervous.

        Nashe joins him as--

                               NASHE
                  So! I heard the Earl of Essex paid for
                  this whole performance! Man's never even
                  been to the theater, and still he's heard
                  of Will--

        Dekker also joins them.

                               DEKKER
                  Essex!? Impossible. My cousin's one of
                  his men-at-arms. Hasn't been paid in
                  weeks. They're all just sitting there,
                  waiting.

                                  JONSON
                  Waiting?     Waiting for what?

                               DEKKER
                  Wants to have an audience with the Queen.
                  As if Cecil would ever let Essex near her
                  now.

                               NASHE
                  By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out!
                  Who can keep up with it all!?

                              NASHE (CONT'D)
                 Zounds, I tire of politics, politics,
                 politics.


119   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAY                                   119

      Oxford is in a long-boat, headed for Whitehall Palace.
      The oars of the boat cut neatly and silently into the
      water.


120   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY         120

      Elizabeth is doing her toilette. She seems excited like
      a school girl before her first date. Her Ladies in
      waiting are attending to her.


121   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  121

      The audience HUSHES as--

      ON STAGE

      "GLOUCESTER", the future Richard III, enters. He is
      hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as
      possible in terms of beard and costume. First the
      people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the
      hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the
      first boos.

      The actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around...

      IN THE GALLERIES

      Dekker seems surprised at the similarity to Robert Cecil.

                              DEKKER
                        (to Nashe)
                 Tired of politics are you? Seems you
                 picked the wrong day to come to the
                 theater, then...

      Jonson gives Dekker a sharp look.   What's going on here?

      ON STAGE

      "Gloucester" addresses the audience.

                              "GLOUCESTER"
                 Now is the winter of our discontent
                 made glorious summer by this son of
                 York. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd
                 his wrinkled front....

                                                                   115
                                                          pg. 116


      The hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the
      actor stops for a moment. But then he finds the courage
      again to continue.

      Jonson looks down at the Groundling's reaction, and
      spots--

      FRANCESCO

      in the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in
      Oxford's usual box seat.

      JONSON

      looks over to Oxford's box.   It's empty.

                               "GLOUCESTER"
                  ...and now instead of mounting barded
                  steeds to fright the souls of fearful
                  adversaries, he capers nimbly in a
                  lady's chamber to the lascivious
                  pleasing of a lute. But I, that am
                  not shaped for sportive tricks, nor
                  made to court an amorous looking-
                  glass...


122   OMIT                                                           122


123   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - ROBERT CECIL'S ROOM - DAY              123

      Robert Cecil watches himself in a mirror as armor is
      placed on him by servants.

                               "GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)
                  I, that am curtail'd of this fair
                  proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent
                  before my time into this breathing
                  world,....


124   EXT. BANKSIDE - IN FRONT OF THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY            124

      The huge crowd has stayed in front of the Globe. It
      seems they are waiting for something. We hear hissing
      and booing from the crowd inside the theater.

                               "GLOUCESTER"
                  ...and that so lamely and
                  unfashionable that dogs bark at me as
                  I halt by them.



                                                                    116

125   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  125

      On stage, "Gloucester: continues despite the concert of
      hissing and booing...

                             "GLOUCESTER"
                And therefore, since I cannot prove a
                lover, I am determined to prove a
                villain and hate the idle pleasures of
                these days...


126   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                        126

      Essex mounts his horse, Southampton at his side. Their
      sixty or so men behind them ready for the march to
      Elizabeth.

                             ESSEX
                Edward knows what he is doing...      Does
                he not?

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                He promised us a mob. They'll be
                here.

      Essex looks concerned, but says no more.


127   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - ROBERT CECIL'S ROOM - DAY             127

      The servant tightens the last strap of Robert Cecil's
      armor. He smiles at himself in the mirror.

                             "GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)
                Plots have I laid!

      CANNONS DRAWN BY HORSES

      as they roll down a cobbled street.   We are:


128   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE   - DAY                                    128

      Soldiers move people and carts off the street. Others
      put CANNONS into place and then cover them with canvas
      tarps.

                             "GLOUCESTER" (O.S.)
                Inductions dangerous, by drunken
                prophecies, libels and dreams, to set
                my brother Clarence and the king in
                deadly hate the one against the other.


                                                                   117

129   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  129

      Shakespeare watches from backstage, getting more and
      more nervous by the audience's reaction.

                               AN AUDIENCE MEMBER
                         (to the actor playing
                          "Gloucester")
                  A pox on you!

                               FRANCESCO
                  A pox on Cecil!

                               MORE AUDIENCE MEMBERS
                  A pox on Cecil! A pox on Cecil!

      The actors are getting nervous.      People start throwing
      lettuce and tomatoes at them.

                               NASHE
                  Why is Oxford's man with the Groundlings?

      BACKSTAGE

      Shakespeare and Burbage exchange a worried glance.


130   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                        130

      The BELLS of St. James' Cathedral mark the hour as five
      o'clock. Essex looks to Southampton nervously.


131   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  131

      The play continues. "Gloucester" is plotting yet
      another death on his way to the throne.

                               "GLOUCESTER"
                  Hath she forgot already that brave
                  prince,    
                  Edward, her lord, whom I, some three
                  months since,    
                  Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
                     A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
                      Fram'd in the prodigality of
                  nature,     Young, valiant, wise, and
                  no doubt right royal-     

                               FRANCESCO
                  Down with Cecil!

      The actor playing "Gloucester" hesitates.     The audience
      is getting unruly.

                                                                   118
                                                    pg. 119


                         FRANCESCO (CONT'D)
            Up with Essex! To Essex House!     To
            Essex House!!

IN THE GALLERIES

Jonson is putting the pieces together.   He stands.

                         JONSON
            This is what Essex is waiting for--
                   (realizing)
            Oxford is bringing him a mob.

Jonson heads for the stairs.

                         NASHE
            Why would Oxford--

                         JONSON
            I don't know, I don't know! But, the
            Tower-- Cecil, he already knows. He
            knows!
                   (looks at Francesco)
            I-- I have to warn them!

Nashe and Dekker are baffled as Jonson rushes down the
stairs.

                         VARIOUS GROUNDLINGS
            Up with Essex! Essex! Death to
            Cecil!

BACKSTAGE

Shakespeare turns to Burbage.

                         SHAKESPEARE
            We must close the play. Now!!

                         BURBAGE
            Close the...? Are you off your head?

We can start to HEAR the audience chanting "Ess-ex,Ess-
ex"...

ON STAGE

It's getting unruly.

                         "GLOUCESTER"
                   (repeating)
            Fram'd... in the prodigality of
            nature, Young, valiant, wise, and no
            doubt right royal-

                                                              119
                                                       pg. 120


      "Ess-ex, Ess-ex, Ess-ex"

      ON THE GROUND

      Jonson pushes his way through the crowd, trying to head
      for Francesco. But they're separated by a sea of people.

                             FRANCESCO
                To Essex House! To Essex House!
                Death to Cecil! Traitor!

      A moment as the whole audience thinks on this. And
      then these chants are repeated by hundreds in the
      audience as they are pushing towards exits.

      And Jonson-- still struggling to reach Francesco-- is
      carried along with the mob.


132   EXT. OUTSIDE THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                        132

      The mob pours out of the doors.

      Storm clouds are gathering.   A RUMBLE of thunder sounds
      in the distance.


133   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY                       133

      Oxford is waiting for his audience, looking out a
      window, nervously.


134   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                  134

      The crowd pours through Bankside, growing in numbers as
      more people come out of taverns, whore-houses, etc...

      A shop-owner comes out of his store, confused.   Another
      MAN grabs him.

                             MAN
                To Essex!   And then to the Queen!
                       (joins in the chanting)
                Ess-ex! Ess-ex!

      The shop-owner begins to get the spirit of the mob.


135   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    135

      If anything, the crowd is twice the size it was moments
      ago. They head down the shop-lined bridge, full of
      bravado.

                                                                 120
                                                      pg. 121


      JONSON

      is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob.   He spots
      Francesco nearby.

      WIDER

      The mob has to slow down on the bridge. There is not
      much room. And then it happens!

      We are at the front of the mob, when the first soldiers
      appear and pull down the tarps revealing the cannons.

      People scream as an Officer appears and--

                               OFFICER
                Fire!

      And then the cannon FIRES. There is PANIC all around,
      and-

      JONSON

      runs with the crowd, trying to escape.


137   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                     137

      Essex and Southampton look tense.   They expected a mob
      here by now.

                             SOUTHAMPTON
                They should be here by now...

      Essex frowns.

                             ESSEX
                We go as we are! Now!!

      And he spurs his horse, and GALLOPS down the street.

                             ESSEX (CONT'D)
                To the Queen!

      Southampton has no choice, and follows.   So do the 60
      or so men behind them.


136   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY                      136

      Oxford hears a cannon shot. But it could also be the
      sound of thunder. He goes to the window, sees the rain
      clouds, and dismisses the sound. A LADY IN WAITING
      enters.

                                                                121
                                                          pg. 122


                                  LADY-IN-WAITING
                   My lord.    Her majesty will be with you
                   shortly.

138   Omitted                                                        138


139   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                       139

      The mob is in panic.      And--

      JONSON

      is in the middle of it.

                                FRANCESCO
                   Signor Jonson! We are betrayed!    Run!
                   Run!

      Jonson looks on in horror as Francesco is KILLED by a
      soldier wielding a pike.


140   EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                        140

      Essex and his men ROAR past the token guards at the
      front gate, and gallop into the--

      MAIN COURTYARD

      Essex rears his horse, looks around at the many windows
      that surround them from above.

                                ESSEX
                   To the Queen! To the Queen!

      His men repeat his plea.      And then, once again, another
      trap springs.

      THE GATE

      SLAMS closed.    And--

      GUARDS ARMED WITH MUSKETS

      line up in a colonnade in the story above.      Pole is in
      command.

                                POLE
                   Take your aim!

                                SOUTHAMPTON
                 It's a trap!

                                ESSEX
                 Spread out!

       But before his men can obey--

       IN THE COLONNADE

       Pole orders--

                                POLE
                 Fire!!

       IN THE COURTYARD

       AND a hundred shots FIRE down into Essex and his men!


141    INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY                       141

       Oxford HEARS the SHOTS fired.    Confused, he goes to a
       window, looks out and sees:

       FROM HIS POV:

       Men fall all around Essex and Southampton.


141A   EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                    141A

       Pole walks down the colonnade.

                                POLE
                 Re-load!


142    INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY              142

       Elizabeth heads for the window just as a door behind
       her SLAMS open, and Robert Cecil hurries in with a
       dozen guards.

                              ROBERT CECIL
                 Majesty! You must away! Essex is in
                 armed revolt! He's come to usurp you!

                             ELIZABETH
                       (confused)
                 Essex? I-- Edward is--

       She seems like a confused old woman.


                                                                  123
                                                       pg. 124


                             ROBERT CECIL
                You must flee! Quickly! Majesty! He
                means to kill you and take your throne
                for himself!

      It takes only an instant for that to sink in. She
      looks enraged. And then she turns with a flurry, and
      heads back the way she came. The guards that were with
      Robert Cecil follow her.


143   EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                     143

      Another fusillade is SHOT, and more of Essex's men go
      down.

      And then doors OPEN on the ground floor, and guards
      RUSH out to take down the survivors.

      Essex and Southampton valiantly fight, but there's just
      too many.

      They're soon surrounded... And Essex, knowing all is
      lost, raises his sword in defeat.

      Southampton sees this, and does the same.


144   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                144

      Oxford watches all of this through the window.

                             ROBERT CECIL (O.S.)
                She won't forgive him this, Edward.

      Oxford turns, devastated.

                              ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
                Essex will be convicted and executed
                for treason.
                       (beat)
                As will your son.

      Oxford looks shocked.

                             ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
                       (smiles)
                What? Didn't you think I knew? Of
                course I knew, Edward. My father told
                me all his secrets. All of them.
                       (smiling)
                Though the most fascinating was not
                made known to me until after his
                death.

                       ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
          He hated you, Edward, how he hated
          you. And yet he married his only
          daughter to you. I never knew why,
          until I read his last letter to me.

                       OXFORD
          He wanted his grandson to be an Earl.

                        ROBERT CECIL
          No, Edward.   He wanted his grandson to
          be a king.

Oxford now looks confused.

                       ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth had several children,
          Edward, not just yours. She was
          sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary
          was still Queen, and our future
          Gloriana was out of favor. No one
          thought her very important at all.
          Except my father, of course. And when
          her first child was born, a male, my
          father took it, and hid it. The
          grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling
          of course had to be reared a nobleman.
          John De Vere, the previous Earl of
          Oxford, agreed to accept the task.

Oxford goes ashen.

                        OXFORD
          You lie...

                        ROBERT CECIL
          Do I?
                 (beat)
          Why do you think he worked so hard to
          become your guardian after your father
          died? He had it all planned years in
          advance. He would teach you
          everything he knew about statecraft,
          marry his daughter, and, after
          Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir.
          His own grandchild to follow you on
          the throne. But he couldn't possibly
          predict what kind of failure you would
          become. How you would fail in
          politics, ignore your estates to the
          point of bankruptcy, all to write...
                 (sneers)
          Poetry.
                 (beat)
          Or that you would commit incest.

                 Delicious isn't it? Right out of a

                              OXFORD
                 Elizabeth would never have--

                               ROBERT CECIL
                 What?  Slept with her son?
                        (beat)
                 I don't think she ever knew, to tell
                 you the truth. Though you never know
                 with the Tudors. They all have had
                 such strange tastes in bed-fellows.
                        (beat)
                 You could have been a king, Edward.
                 And your son after you. Except for
                 the fact that... you were you.


145    EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                     145

       It's raining, hard.

       Oxford almost stumbles out of the building onto the now
       empty courtyard. The remains of the battle are still
       visible. Wounded, screaming horses struggle to
       stand...

       Oxford's a shell-- devoid of emotion. Broken. Hardly
       alive at all. He drops to his knees, the rain pouring
       down on him.

       We see the silhouette of a man watching through a
       window from the second story above. It's--


145A   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - HALL - SAME TIME                   145A

       --Robert Cecil, a slight smile on his face.

       Pole approaches him from behind. Robert Cecil doesn't
       turn or acknowledge Pole, but speaks to him as he
       stares at Oxford.

                              ROBERT CECIL
                 I want a fair trial for Southampton...
                 Evidence, witnesses, no false
                 confessions. It must be above
                 reproach. Though with a guilty
                 verdict of course. Oh, and Pole--
                        (turns)
                 If there is any mention of that play--

146   EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                             146

      Oxford is sitting in a chair, watching the river
      Thames, alone. Snow is falling and Oxford is covered
      in a thick blanket. He looks ill.

      Anne walks up behind him.

                             ANNE
                Sentence has been passed.

      Oxford looks over at her.   Anne smiles.   This news
      gives her great pleasure.

                              ANNE (CONT'D)
                They are to be be-headed.
                       (with venom)
                Both of them. Essex tomorrow,
                Southampton in a week.

                Your son is going to be killed,
                Edward. By his own mother. Put that
                in one of your plays!

      And she leaves him with that.


147   EXT. THE TOWER OF LONDON - COURTYARD - DAY                   147

      Essex-- dressed in black, but with a bright red
      waistcoat-- is led up a scaffold by guards, his hands
      bound behind him.

      Snow covers the courtyard. There are only a few
      witnesses, as befitting Essex's rank.

      ESSEX

      stands, looking at life one last time. The Executioner
      approaches with an axe. Essex turns, realizing it is
      time.

                               ESSEX
                Strike true.

      He kneels, resting his head on a wooden bench.

                                                                  127

                              ESSEX (CONT'D)
                 God save the Queen!

      And BAM!   Just as the axe lands we--

                                                           CUT TO:

      FROM A WINDOW

      we see the body of Essex fall onto the scaffolding, his
      head into a basket. We are:


148   INT. THE TOWER OF LONDON - A CELL - DAY                        148

      Southampton, a prisoner, is watching his future fate
      from a room high in a tower.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      BOOTS

      as they walk, limping along tiled floors.      We are:


149   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY                 149

      Doors fly open and Oxford appears before Elizabeth, who
      is on her throne, regal and all in white, surrounded
      by courtiers, including Robert Cecil. But she looks
      very old, very ill.

      Everyone goes silent as Oxford approaches Elizabeth.
      Oxford makes no notice of them. He bows deeply in
      front of her.

                                ELIZABETH
                 Leave us.    All of you.

      People start to exit.     But not Robert Cecil.

                                ROBERT CECIL
                 Majesty, I--

                                ELIZABETH
                 Leave us!

      Cecil exits, obviously worried.       When they are alone:

                              ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                 You look old...

      Oxford smiles sadly.


                                                                    128

          I thank your majesty for seeing me.

                       ELIZABETH
          You cannot have him.

                       OXFORD
          He is our son.

                       ELIZABETH
          Who did commit High Treason!

                       OXFORD
          They only wished for a place in
          government equal to their station.
          Equal to their birth.

                       ELIZABETH
          You caused this! Your play, your
          words, caused my people to mob against
          me! Do you think I wasn't aware of
          your plot with this man Shakespeare,
          that I wouldn't recognize your voice?
          It should be your head on the block
          next week, not Southampton's!

Oxford kneels.

                       OXFORD
          Then take my head. In our son's
          stead.

Elizabeth turns away from him, angered.   She walks to a
window, turns her back on him.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Neither they nor I ever conspired
          against you. Cecil alone was our aim.
          He has corrupted your--

                        ELIZABETH
          Cecil?  He has kept me my throne!
                 (beat)
          Mary, Queen of Scots... Philip, King
          of Spain... Four French Louis's...

          My throne. All of them!

          Yet here I remain... Because of the

                        ELIZABETH
          You would have protected me? You? My
          "loyal" Earls?
                 (snarls)
          You think Essex and Southampton were
          the first to conspire against me, to
          try to take my throne? No!
                 (beat)
          Only the Cecils could I trust!
          Commoners! They could never claim my
          throne. Never! Their wealth, their
          power, their survival, all depended on
          me. Me and no other!

A long beat before--

                       OXFORD
          Let our child live...

                       ELIZABETH
                 (furious)
          All Englishmen are my children!

She has a coughing fit. Oxford patiently waits until
she has recovered. Finally...

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Does he know?

Oxford shakes his head.

                       ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          And if I give him to you?

                       OXFORD
          He will never learn of it from me.

She pauses for a long moment...    And then she decides.

                        ELIZABETH
          He must never know... Never.
                 (beat)
          Take him.

Oxford dares to smile, relieved.

                        OXFORD
          But only after my death! Only then!
          When all is complete. After James is
          crowned king, his crown safe, only
          then can you claim your son... our
          son.

      procession for the greatest Queen England has ever

      of the queen.

      All the lords and ladies of the land.   All wear
      elaborate black clothing.

      First is Robert Cecil.   Proudly.   Not far walks Oxford.

      He is a statue. Devoid of emotion. And then joyous

      All the lords and ladies of the land are standing in

      ROBERT CECIL

      is watching James. His face betrays his proud

      Oxford's wife Anne is there, but Oxford is nowhere to

      It's foggy. Oxford stands next to a carriage, waiting
      as the gates open, and Southampton-- scruffy and a bit
      worse for wear-- is escorted out.

      Southampton smiles weakly when he sees Oxford waiting
      for him. The two men walk towards each other and
      embrace.

      Both men have tears in their eyes.

      Shakespeare is on stage, supervising a rehearsal of
      "Much Ado About Nothing". He doesn't look pleased.

                             SHAKESPEARE
                The line won't get a laugh that way.
                You must accent the word sirrah--

                              JONSON (O.S.)
                Will!   Will Shakespeare!



                                                                 132

      Shakespeare turns and sees Jonson heading his way.
      Jonson is completely drunk, waving a sword in one hand,
      a tankard in another.

                               JONSON (CONT'D)
                So!    Off to the palace are you?

      Shakespeare immediately sees Jonson's condition.

                              SHAKESPEARE
                Ben!

                             JONSON
                A command performance for our new
                king! Even in bloody Scotland they've
                heard of bloody Will Shakespeare, have
                they? Fraud. Charlatan.
                Counterfeiter of wit! Murderer!

      The actors on stage are all watching, nervous.

                             SHAKESPEARE
                Ben, please...

      But Jonson CHARGES Shakespeare. Shakespeare easily
      dodges the drunk Jonson. Jonson ROARS and attacks
      again.

      Shakespeare dodges again, turns, and manages to grab
      Jonson by the throat. They are face to face.

                             SHAKESPEARE (CONT'D)
                You came to me, Ben. You came to me!

      They stare at each other and then Shakespeare SHOVES
      him off. Jonson falls to the ground.

                Master Jonson?

      Jonson looks up to see one of Oxford's servants
      standing above him.

      The servant guides Jonson towards Oxford's bedroom just
      as Anne and a DOCTOR emerge from it. She recognizes
      him.

                             ANNE
                       (to servant)
                What is this man doing in my house?

      The servant doesn't know what to say.

                             ANNE (CONT'D)
                       (to Jonson)
                You will leave at once. My husband is
                quite ill--

                             JONSON
                It was your husband who sent for me,
                madam.

                             ANNE
                And I am dismissing you--

      A SECOND DOCTOR exits the sick man's room.

                             SECOND DOCTOR
                Are you Jonson?

      Jonson nods.

                             SECOND DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                He's asking for you.

      Oxford, in bed, looks quite ill, sweat covering his
      brow.

      He furiously writes on a small tablet on his lap. He
      holds up his hand for silence as Jonson enters, the
      doctor following behind him.

                             OXFORD
                Thank you, doctor.

      The doctor exits.


                                                                 134

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Come over here, Jonson...

He points to a chair by the bed. When Jonson sits down
he notices a big pile of manuscripts by the side of the
bed.

                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Did you know, Jonson, that my family
          can trace its peerage farther back
          than any family in the kingdom?   We
          fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field.
          At Agincourt.
                 (beat)
          I inherited my Earldom as one of the
          wealthiest men ever to breathe English
          air... and at last breath, I shall be
          one of the poorest.

Jonson looks on sadly.

                        OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Never a voice in government. Never a
          sword raised in glorious battle. No
          immortal deeds for my heirs to know me
          by.
                 (beat)
          Words, merely words, are to be my
          legacy...
                 (beat)
          You alone watch my plays and know them
          as mine. When I hear the applause,
          the cheering, of the audience, all
          those hands clapping, they are
          celebrating... another man. But in
          that cacophony of sounds, I strained
          to hear the sound of two hands only.
          Yours.
                 (beat)
          But heard them, I never did.

Jonson stares at him.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          Death takes away all pretense and
          demands honesty from its target. You,
          you have never told me... never told
          me what you thought of my work...

To answer is not an easy task for Jonson's ego.    He
hesitates.

                       JONSON
                 (almost a whisper)
          I find... your words... the most
          wondrous ever heard on our stage.    On
          any stage... Ever.

The two men now looking each other in the eye.

                       JONSON (CONT'D)
                 (sotto)
          You are the soul of the age...

Oxford smiles at the thought of it.   Then--

                       OXFORD
          Promise me... promise me, Jonson, that
          you will keep our secret safe. That
          you won't expose Shakespeare...

                         JONSON
          My lord?

                       OXFORD
          I have seen it in your face... He
          vexes you. How could he not? But he
          is not your burden. He is mine.

Then he nods to the manuscripts by his side.

                       OXFORD (CONT'D)
          All my writings. The plays, the
          sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them
          from my family. From the Cecil's.
          Wait a few years, and then, publish
          them.

Jonson looks stricken.

                       JONSON
          I am not worthy of this charge, my
          lord. I... I betrayed you... I told
          them of your--

                       OXFORD
          I have made it my life to know the
          character of men, Jonson. I know you.
          You may have betrayed me, but you will
          never betray my words...

He puts the last manuscript on the pile.

      Jonson leaves Oxford's room, visibly shaken.    The
      manuscripts are under his arm.

      Anne, Oxford's wife is still there, surround by
      doctors.

      Then she sees Jonson leaving.

                                ANNE
                   Get out! You, your friends, your
                   blasphemous theaters, have brought
                   nothing but ruin and dishonor to this
                   family.

                                JONSON
                   Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your
                   family, me, even Elizabeth herself
                   shall be remembered solely because we
                   had the honor to live whilst your
                   husband put ink to paper.

                   To the Earl of Southampton. The love
                   I dedicate to your lordship is without
                   end; whereof this pamphlet, without
                   beginning, is but a superfluous
                   moiety.

      Jonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house,
      realizing there is another whole layer to all this;
      exactly what he can only guess.

      watches as a doctor covers his face with a sheet.

                What I have done is yours; what I have

                Were my worth greater, my duty would
                show greater; meantime, as it is, it
                is bound to your lordship, to whom I
                wish long life... still lengthened

      Southampton is there as well.   Watching. Tears roll
      down his cheeks.

      Where we began.

      A bucket of water is DUMPED on Jonson. He regains
      consciousness and looks around. Somewhat confused he
      sees:

      Robert Cecil limping out of the dark towards him.
      Robert Cecil leans down, and very close to his ear,
      whispers:

                             CECIL
                I can make all this go away, Jonson...
                To be but a dream. Like one of your
                plays... Or, I can bring you so much
                pain-- pain that were you given a
                thousand years, and a thousand quills,
                you could never justly describe...

      Cecil steps back.

          I know you have them. All his
          manuscripts. My sister saw you leave
          Oxford Stone with them under your arm.

Jonson takes a long time before answering. Will he
betray Oxford?

          They were destroyed...   burned...   by
          your own men...

Cecil doesn't know whether to believe him or not.

                       INTERROGATOR
          He's lying...

                       JONSON
          My lord? Why would I lie? Is there a
          man alive who has reason to hate him
          more than I?

Jonson stares directly at Cecil, knowing he is speaking
about Cecil as well as himself.

                       JONSON (CONT'D)
          He was something I could never be. An
          undeniable perfection... that plagued
          my soul... And to him I was...
          nothing. A messenger. Nothing more.

Cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching
for the truth. Then he smiles.

                        CECIL
          Let him go!   He tells the truth.

Robert Cecil turns to leave, but then turns a last
time.

                       CECIL (CONT'D)
          And Jonson-- better him, won't you?
          Wipe his memory for all time. For
          you. And for me.

Robert Cecil smiles at Jonson, who can only stare at
him. Finally:

                       JONSON
                 (sotto)
          I am afraid that this is not possible,
          my lord.

Robert Cecil's smile freezes and he leaves.

163    EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON - DAWN               163

       Jonson is getting released. He walks away....a lonely

       Set for a Court performance of a play. Courtiers bow
       as King James I enters the chamber, Robert Cecil two
       steps behind him. James takes his seat right in front
       of the stage, as Elizabeth used to.

       Jonson's eyes search the ground.   And, eventually, he
       finds it--

       THE METAL BOX

       that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration.

       JONSON

       opens the box.

       INSIDE THE BOX

       Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him. Jonson smiles,
       relieved. They are singed at the edges, but they are
       there. We hear--

                               PROLOGUE (O.S.)
                  O-- for a muse of fire... that would

       the "play" at the beginning of the film. But now he

       monochromatic and grey.

      King James' watches enthusiastically, Robert Cecil
      right next to him.

                             JAMES I
                We had seen some of this Shakespeare's
                plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert. I
                must tell you, we enjoyed them
                immensely, and look forward to seeing
                many more, now that we are in
                London... I presume you are as avid a
                theater man as myself?

      Robert Cecil's smile remains frozen.

                             ROBERT CECIL
                Of course, your majesty...

      The CAMERA moves away from them and we realize we are
      on the theater stage where we started.

      "Prologue" turns and addresses his audience (and us) in
      the modern theater.

                              PROLOGUE
                Robert Cecil remained the most powerful
                man in the Court of King James, though he
                could not prevent the public theaters
                from becoming ever more popular. William
                Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining
                years of his life not in the playhouses
                of London, but in the small town of his
                birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a
                businessman and grain merchant.

                        PROLOGUE (CONT'D)
          Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be
          the most celebrated playwright of his
          time, becoming England's first Poet
          Laureate. And in 1623, he wrote the
          dedication to the collected works of the
          man we call William Shakespeare.
                 (beat)
          And so... though our story is finished,
          our poet's is not. For his monument is
          ever-living, made not of stone but of
          verse, and it shall be remembered... as
          long as words are made of breath and
          breath of life.

The curtains close.

               a vast, green corporate campus. Their mylar skins are 
               imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed 
               in Outpost-colored bunting.

               18,000 Outpost employees cheer. They're spread out over 
               rolling lawns, amid Arabian tents and costumed Acrobats. 
               Over the balloon-dotted sky, the graphic re-appears: "The

                         There's this prejudice against super-
                         smart people. People like Gary.

               GARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional 
               Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm:

                         Alice? You gotta make him do the 
                         start-up with Teddy and me.

                                     ALICE
                         "Make" him?

                                     LARRY
                              (thoughtfully)
                         You know what I mean.

               As we hear Larry speak, we cut back into:

               THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               The lights are on. Milo & Teddy stand by a table dressed in 
               Outpost bunting, laden with refreshments & giveaways: 
               mousepads, T-shirts, caps & books with the Outpost logo on 
               them (a simple contour drawing of a frontier outpost). While 
               most Students chat earnestly with Recruiters, Milo & Teddy 
               load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips.

                                     LARRY (V.O.)
                         I'm not exactly worldly, but I'm the 
                         Secretary of State next to him.

               Milo puts some brownies on his plate.

                                     LARRY (V.O.)
                         And they're all throwing this -- 
                         stuff at him. Stock options. Pay 
                         packages.

               Spotting a book on the table, Milo picks it up.

               EXT. GATES BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

                                     LARRY
                         I'm just screwed.

                                     ALICE
                              (that's not true)
                         You know what he's like. He just 
                         wants to work on stuff that's cool.

                                     LARRY
                         You don't wanna move, do you?

                                     ALICE
                         I can paint anywhere.

               Larry looks at her: you didn't answer my question.

                                     ALICE
                         I'd like to stay here, yeah. And I 
                         kind of think he should be with Teddy.

               THE AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo and Teddy discuss the book almost joyfully. (We see a 
               page of code: utterly indecipherable.)

                                     ALICE (V.O.)
                         I mean, nobody else can follow what 
                         they're talking about half the time.

                                     MILO/TEDDY

                         the locking code -- If it didn't seg 
                         fault, first!

               EXT. GATES BLDG. - CONTINUOUS

                                     ALICE
                         Maybe you shouldn't push it so hard. 
                         About Outpost. No offense, you sound 
                         insane.

                                     LARRY
                         I can't help it. I feel like they'd 
                         do anything to keep their --

                                     ALICE
                         Anything? That's not even credible. 
                         If he wants to go up there? To check 
                         it out? I think you should encourage 
                         him.
                              (seeing Larry's 
                              incredulity)
                         It's his life. But everybody's 
                         treating him like this -- valuable  
                         object. You're hurting your own case.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

               Brian, already wearing one of the Outpost caps, effuses to 
               Redmond.

                                     BRIAN
                         He's my god. I hear he actually calls 
                         recruits sometimes. Or is that an 
                         Urban Legend?

                                     REDMOND
                         Gary's running the biggest software 
                         company in the world, Brian. He's 
                         being harassed by the Justice 
                         Department, and he's got a new baby.

               Across the room, Milo (eating chips, perusing code) reaches 
               for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting. It unravels 
               in a long TP-like streamer -- just as Danny approaches, 
               peering at Milo's ID tag.

                                     DANNY
                         Milo? I'm Danny.

                                     MILO
                         Oh hi.

               He tries to sluff the paper off his hand; Danny holds out a 
               cell phone.

                                     DANNY
                         Gary would like to speak to you?

               Milo and Teddy look at each other: right. But Danny looks 
               like he means it. Milo's grin fades. He takes the phone.

                                     MILO
                         ...Hello?

                                     GARY (ON THE PHONE)
                         Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and 
                         your friend can come up here. We've 
                         made some amazing strides in digital 
                         convergence. I'd love to show them 
                         to you.

                                     MILO
                         You would? Wow. When would we come?
                              (he waits; he looks 
                              up)
                         'Think he hung up.

               Danny holds out two plane tickets, in 1st class folders.

               INT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE DINER (PALO ALTO) - NIGHT

               Alice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously.

                                     ALICE
                         But how does he know that's what you 
                         guys're working on?

               Larry, Teddy & Brian are at the table with Alice & Milo. 
               It's a student hang-out, with loud music.

                                     MILO
                         All the companies know. The faculties 
                         tell 'em. At the target schools.

                                     LARRY
                         In exchange for endowments. They 
                         should just drop the pretense and 
                         name the schools after 'em.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Teddy)
                         I can't believe you refused a ticket!

                                     TEDDY
                         My parents're already freaked-out 
                         I'm staying here. 50 miles from 
                         Chinatown.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well maybe if you told 'em how much 
                         money you'd be making --
                              (to Milo)
                         You're going up there. Right?

                                     LARRY
                         I think you should go.

                                     MILO
                              (amazed)
                         You do?

                                     LARRY
                         I mean, it's your life.

               As Alice predicted, Milo is pleased by Larry's remark. 
               "Empowered." Larry smiles conspiratorially at Alice.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               In a tidy, playfully decorated room, Alice stirs in bed, 
               sees the space next to her is vacant.

               TINY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of 
               a PC. He looks up, sees Alice in the doorway.

                                     MILO
                         I think I kind of lost it. I was 
                         just so thrilled to be talking to 
                         the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't 
                         know I even cared about that stuff.

                                     ALICE
                         C'mon, how often do you talk to 
                         somebody who's been on the cover of 
                         Time. Three of four times.

               She picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code 
               manuals, Coke cans) sits next to him.

                                     MILO
                         A lot of what Larry says is true. 
                         They just clone stuff, or reverse 
                         engineer it, and everybody gets stuck 
                         with their inferior version cause 
                         they --

                                     ALICE
                         Then you've gotta ask him about that.

               He looks at her: you've gotta be kidding.

                                     ALICE
                         It's important.

                                     MILO
                         If he's really a bully, he won't cop 
                         to it, anyway.

                                     ALICE
                         Bully? Are we talking about Gary 
                         Boyd? Or your dad.

               He doesn't deny it: she sees right through him.

                                     MILO
                         When I was a kid? And he was moving 
                         us all over the place? I spent all 
                         my time writing stuff on Outpost 
                         1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the 
                         greatest.

                                     ALICE
                         But he's not quite the same guy 
                         anymore. Don't get your hopes too 
                         high?

               INT. 737 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

               In the cabin, everybody types on a notebook but Milo. He 
               looks out the window expectantly: at the Seattle skyline.

               INT. SEA-TAC AIRPORT - GATE 13 - DAY

               Milo comes off the plane. Danny and Redmond greet him.

               INT/EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY

               Redmond drives his black Lexus 85 m.p.h. Danny leans forward 
               from the backseat.

                         He's pretty tight with his family.

                                     DANNY
                         We could move 'em up here.

                                     MILO
                         He just likes to write code. He's 
                         bummed there's so much secrecy and 
                         competition, everybody trying to own 
                         everything.

                         Who do you mean by "everybody."

               Milo almost blushes. He makes an awkward segue.

                                     MILO
                         So -- how far are we from the campus?

                                     REDMOND
                         Oh we're not going to the campus.

               Beyond a rocky beach, buildings are cunningly carved into a 
               wooded hillside. Glass walls are framed in rich wood. The 
               main house is 28,000 sq. ft. Then there's the guest house, 
               pool building, reception hall, library...

               EXT. GATEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Redmond pulls up. A discreet Guard in a Mr. Rogers cardigan 
               recognizes him. The gates swing open.

               EXT. BOYD HOUSE - DAY

               They pull up by a Lexus SUV with a baby seat. Another Man in 
               a cardigan stands in the open front door.

                                     MILO
                         Who's that?

                                     DANNY
                         I think they call him the "Houseman." 
                         'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.

               Milo just sits there, eyeing the monumental residence.

                                     DANNY
                         Don't be nervous. The house is the 
                         weirdest thing about him.

                                     REDMOND
                         It's like he knows everybody expects 
                         him to be this worldly, colorful 
                         zillionaire. But he's just a guy who

               Milo and the Houseman cross a long room with a lake view. We 
               hear music by Satie. The Craftsman furniture and lamps are 
               custom-made. A Cezanne hangs on the wall.

               ANOTHER DEN-LIKE ROOM WITH A VIEW

               There's a Craftsman crib here, stuffed animals, another 
               Cezanne. Even the toys seem arranged. They enter an

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Have a seat. He won't be long.

               Milo sits on a bench. He tries not to look, but his childhood 
               hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: 
               Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face. But 
               something goes on behind his pleasant features and self-
               possessed mien: his desire (or need) to solve the problem at 
               hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed -- even 
               vulnerable.

               CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               As Gary concentrates, two Outpost Senior Managers speak: 
               PHIL TATE, 40 (bald); and RANDY GRIMES, 36, (gray eyes).

                                     PHIL
                         We tried the big vaporware number, 
                         Gary, it's no-sale.

                                     RANDY
                         Can we buy into their IPO? Or is 
                         that a Justice Dept. problem?

                                     PHIL
                         There is no public offering. The guy 
                         who wrote it joined some freakazoid 
                         cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this 
                         just to run their web site.

               ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Gary speaks with precise hand gestures: settling the matter. 
               Phil and Randy gather their papers, and stand. They exit, 
               nodding at Milo as they pass. Then Gary comes out.

                                     GARY
                         Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV.

               Milo is a little dazzled as they shake hands: such a fam- 
               iliar face, such a big figure in his young life.

                                     MILO
                         ...That's okay.

               INT. DEN-LIKE ROOM - MOVING

               Now New Age music plays. They move back through the same 
               room, but the Cezanne has been replaced by a Hieronymus Bosch 
               (bodies roiling in Hell). Milo is -- puzzled.

                                     GARY
                         The house knows the paintings I like, 
                         it knows my favorite music. Same for 
                         anybody else who's in the system.

               NEXT ROOM - STILL MOVING

               As they walk, Milo watches a Cezanne "original" digitally re-
               configure to a Bosch, brushstrokes and all.

                                     MILO
                         Cool!

                                     GARY
                         Would you like a Coke or something?

                                     MILO
                              (too shy, too nervous)
                         Oh. No thanks.

               He opens a glass-doored refrigerator, scans a shelf with 
               rows of Snapples -- in alphabetical order.

                                     GARY
                         When we started, I just hired my 
                         smart friends. That was great. We 
                         got a little bigger, I had to hire 
                         smart strangers. Much harder.

               He selects a Kiwi-Raspberry, they walk on.

                                     GARY
                         Now I don't get to hire anybody. But 
                         I know you're the guy to write 
                         Skywire.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM (LAKE VIEW) - MOMENTS LATER

               They enter. An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptych. 
               As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stands 
               by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Soutine, 
               Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein...)

                                     MILO
                         You know a lot about art, I guess.

                                     GARY
                         There's a rumor going around, maybe 
                         you've heard it.

               Gary heads back, carrying something spherical.

                                     GARY
                         There's more to life than computers? 
                         I'm looking into it.

               Glancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary looks 
               vaguely afflicted. He mutters:

                                     GARY
                         'Once I start looking into something.

               Looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, 
               detailed metal object: model satellite.

                                     GARY
                         I've only shown this to three other 
                         people. I bought 200, we've launched 
                         12 so far. I keep the coordinates in 
                         this room.
                              (as Milo takes it, 
                              carefully)
                         It's left over from SDI. Reagan's 
                         Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 
                         miles up.

                                     MILO
                         Low enough to relay internet traffic.

                                     GARY
                              (he smiles: exactly)
                         Among other things... We know 
                         convergence is the real super-highway: 
                         all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. 
                         linked together. Why cram it into a 
                         cable if you can use the whole sky?

                                     MILO
                              (turning the sleek 
                              object)
                         Skywire.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - LATER

               Milo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips his 
               own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language.

                                     GARY
                         The content filer has t'be written 
                         into the media files so bits coming 
                         off the satellite can be read by 
                         multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. 
                         Including whatever new hardware 
                         emerges.

                                     MILO
                         It needs a more object-oriented 
                         language. This doesn't scale, does 
                         it?

                                     GARY
                         You'd have to start practically from 
                         scratch. But this is all you'd be 
                         working on. No marketing meetings, 
                         no product seminars. We can't waste 
                         the time. Half the Valley's working 
                         on convergence. So're media 
                         conglomerates, cable companies, phone 
                         companies. 'Can't finish second, 
                         Milo. There is no second... Now what 
                         would you like to ask me?

               Milo has a deer-in-the-headlights look.

                                     MILO
                         ...Ask you?

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM - DUSK

               As they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary 
               seems to read his mind.

                                     GARY
                         I know what people say, and not just 
                         the Justice Department. We clone 
                         ideas, inflict our second-rate 
                         versions on the world, we haven't 
                         done anything original since 1.0.

               Milo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor.

                                     GARY
                         Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put 
                         some of our apps up against anybody's. 
                         But is there some truth to it?

               They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo watches 
               Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow.

                                     GARY
                         When you get to a certain age, you 
                         start wondering. About your legacy. 
                         I doubt you even remember Outpost 
                         1.0 --

                                     MILO
                         I do!

                                     GARY
                              (pleased)
                         Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I 
                         wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 
                         in cyber-years. I look at you and 
                         see the things that got me here.
                              (the furrows deepen)
                         But somehow got away.

               EXT. CUPERTINO HILLS (SILICON VALLEY) - NIGHT

               A block of floodlit "tract mansions," Taco Bell palaces of 
               the Valley's newly rich. Milo & Alice cross a vacant lot to 
               where the lights twinkle below. Their '89 Honda Civic is 
               parked nearby. Milo is excited.

                                     MILO
                         If my dad'd leveled with me like 
                         that even once... The weird thing 
                         is, my fantasy he could somehow be 
                         like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, 
                         too.

                                     ALICE
                         I think that's great, Milo. I do.

                                     MILO
                         ...But?

                                     ALICE
                         Didn't you visit the campus?

                                     MILO
                         I forgot. That's why you have to 
                         help me decide.

                                     ALICE
                         No way. You have this -- destiny.

                                     MILO
                         C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny 
                         without you. My destiny would be 
                         dying at 20. From eating --

                                     ALICE
                         Don't bring that up. Like a different 
                         girlfriend would'd've let you die?

                                     MILO
                              (shrugs)
                         You saved my life in alot of ways.

               He's sweet. She kisses him. He holds onto her.

                                     ALICE
                         It's not just Gary that makes you 
                         wanna go there? 'Cause it's a big 
                         place. You might not even see him 
                         again.

               He'd hate to think that's true. But he manages a smile.

                                     MILO
                         I know.

               EXT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The Honda is loaded with luggage and boxes, some of which 
               are tied to the roof. Milo & Alice stow a final piece.

                                     MILO
                         When's Brian coming for the TV?

                                     ALICE
                         Prob'ly waiting by the phone for 
                         Outpost to call. We'll leave it for 
                         him?

               As they head back in, they see a Toyota park at the curb.

                                     ALICE
                         'Give you guys some time alone.

               She continues inside. He waits, watches Teddy cross the 
               sidewalk to join him.

                                     MILO
                         ...You got my E-mail?

                         And your phone messages. You wanna 
                         do what you do, it's not a crime.

                                     MILO
                         Is that how Larry feels?

                                     TEDDY
                         Uh. Not exactly.

               A brown Buick parks behind Teddy's car. As they speak, a 
               rumpled, 50ish MAN in an off-the-rack suit gets out.

                                     MILO
                         Wanted to say goodbye to him...

                                     TEDDY
                         Hey, we got seed money for the 
                         startup! A million-five!

               Milo grins, he high-fives Teddy.

                                     TEDDY
                         We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.
                              (he gives Milo the 
                              number)
                         You know what's the bad part? We 
                         can't talk about work anymore. We're 
                         competitors! The venture capitalists 
                         made us sign like 100 confidentiality 
                         forms.

                                     MILO
                         Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess 
                         we'll find out what else we have to 
                         talk about. Life stuff.

               They embrace. It's awkward, but it's heartfelt.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo enters, reading Teddy's phone number.

                                     MILO
                         Guess what? They got their --

               The rumpled Man sits on a radiator, watching CNN on a TV, 
               the last remaining piece of furniture. Alice enters, holding 
               a jam jar filled water, hands Milo a business card.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo, this is Mr. Barton from the 
                         Justice Department.
                              (gives Barton the 
                              water)
                         Sorry about the glass.

               Milo reads the card: Lyle Barton, Asst. Prosecutor, DOJ, 
               Seattle Branch Office. Milo's a little spooked.

                                     BARTON
                         Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a 
                         friend. Or maybe a supplicant.

                                     MILO
                         Right... What's that mean again?

                                     BARTON
                         Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with 
                         Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart 
                         as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell 
                         which technologies pose the threat 
                         of a monopoly. We need a really smart 
                         guy to help us pick our fights. I'm 
                         taking a shot in the dark, here. I 
                         can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. 
                         I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's 
                         the right thing to do.

                                     MILO
                              (fiddling with the 
                              card)
                         It's just -- I kind of feel the need 
                         to do something with my ability. 
                         Create something...

                                     BARTON
                         Like I said: shot in the dark.

               Milo tries to give back the card.

                                     BARTON
                         If you see something there that rubs 
                         you the wrong way? Do the right thing.

               And he goes.

                                     MILO
                         That took some fun out of --

                                     ALICE
                         We're not gonna let it.

               She kisses him. They head out. We linger. On TV a graphic 
               says: SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA: MASS SUICIDE - LIVE. Emergency 
               Medical Personnel roll gurneys with bodies out of a new 
               Mediterranean mansion. Footage shows bodies (including a few 
               children) on bunkbeds, uniformly shod in black Nikes.

                         sedatives crushed in apple sauce. 
                         According to the cult's eerily 
                         professional website, it was "time 
                         to move on..."

               EXT. OUTPOST CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY

               Crane past identical, low, steel & glass buildings, amid the 
               vast lawns & fir trees... Past a building under 
               construction... To find Redmond's Lexus, cruising.

               INT./EXT. REDMOND'S CAR/CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

               Milo looks out the window, Redmond gives the tour:

                                     REDMOND
                         There're 20 buildings, I mean not 
                         counting the Gyms, the Day Care, 
                         etc.

               The Day Care is a Michael Graves-looking building with a big 
               cartoon-dog sculpture on its roof, ears cocked to the sky. A 
               Teacher leads her little charges inside.

                                     REDMOND
                         Gary's put millions in there. And 
                         the people with kids? They're not 
                         hotshot geeks, they're just payroll 
                         clerks or whatever.

               Two Men in suits, with briefcases, (conspicuous amid the 
               Geeks in jeans and T-shirts) enter Building #19.

                                     REDMOND
                         You'll see alot of that: Department 
                         of Justice goons snooping around.

               The car pulls into a lot full of Miatas, BMW's, Boxters.

               CLOSE ON - THE OUTPOST LOGO

               THEN TILT UP TO SHOW:

               EXT. BUILDING 20 QUAD - DAY

               The logo is of inlaid stone. Redmond & Milo walk over it. 
               Milo carries a box with some personal effects, including a 
               small painting. Redmond wears a photo I.D. tag.

                                     REDMOND
                         So how'd you like the house?

                                     MILO
                         His Snapples were in alphabetical 
                         order.

                                     REDMOND
                              (he laughs)
                         Well, he micro-managed the company 
                         till it got too big...
                              (he opens the door)
                         'Guess he needs to micro-manage 
                         something.

               INT. BLDG. 20 LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               At the desk, a RECEPTIONIST looks up, stands to hang a 
               temporary ID pass around Milo's neck.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Milo, I'm Judith. Welcome!

               Milo smiles. Redmond uses his magnetic swipe card on an inner 
               door (a security cam is at every door); he holds the door 
               open for Milo.

               INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               They walk up a long carpeted hallway, past open offices where 
               Geeks (mostly males under 30) sit at workstations.

                                     REDMOND
                         Everybody has the same office, there's 
                         no dumbass corporate hierarchy.

               They pass a room in which Geeks play video games. Just outside 
               it, a chubby programmer, DESI, sips a Diet Coke.

                                     DESI
                         Get out while you can, dude!

                                     REDMOND
                         Desi, Milo.

                                     DESI
                         The guy who was at Gary's house?

               He bows deep, with mock-obeisance. Milo blushes, Redmond 
               laughs, he snags Milo's elbow. They walk again, passing a 
               service hall with a Civil Defense sign.

                                     REDMOND
                         Best bomb shelters in America, 
                         accessible from every building. You 
                         gotta figure we're a major target, 
                         right?

               ANOTHER HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

               Up the hall, a young woman (LISA) is about to go into her 
               office. She pauses half a second, looks at Milo, goes in. 
               She's beautiful.

                                     REDMOND
                         Whoa. Lisa actually looked at you.

               As they pass her office, they look in: she's already at her 
               workstation, studiously avoiding their gaze.

                                     REDMOND
                         Every geek here's got a thing for 
                         Lisa. But that's about the biggest 
                         reaction she's had to anybody.

                                     MILO
                              (shy, changing the 
                              emphasis)
                         She's a programmer?

                                     REDMOND
                         Heavy graphical background, doing 
                         design-interface for Skywire apps.
                              (he all but winks)
                         You'll be working with her.

                                     MILO
                         I've got a girlfriend, remember?

                                     REDMOND
                         Right. That's rare around here. You 
                         know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 
                         'Posties are married to Outpost.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - MOMENT LATER

               A handsome, modest office like all the others: workstation, 
               whiteboard, window. They enter.

                                     REDMOND
                         Here's your world.
                              (pointing at the desk)
                         Copy of Gary's book, also the audio 
                         version, narrated by Gary.

               Milo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highway 
               (Gary by a highway on its cover). As we look at it:

                                     VOICE (SHROT)
                         The card's encoded. Tells us who 
                         came through the door and when.

               INT. OFFICE OF PHYSICAL SECURITY - LATER

               In an office with a bank of monitors that play feeds from 
               security cameras, BOB SHROT, 40, Head of Physical Security, 
               issues Milo his swipe card. Redmond watches.

                                     SHROT
                         Unauthorized entries sound like this.

               He drags the card through a sample slot, producing an 
               unbelievably loud, piercing EEEEEEEE. He shouts over it:

                                     SHROT
                         If you see a tailgater, report him.

                                     MILO
                         Tailgater?

                                     SHROT
                              (kills the alarm)
                         Somebody coming in on your swipe.
                              (gives Milo a photo 
                              ID)
                         You see somebody wandering around 
                         without ID, it's your duty to 
                         challenge him. I don't give a shit 
                         if you're a stock-option billionaire. 
                         If you don't challenge, I'll have 
                         your butt.

               INT. HALLWAY - LATER

                                     MILO
                         He seems a little -- tense.

                                     REDMOND
                         Geeks pull his chain cause he's non-
                         tech. Ex-cop or something. They moon 
                         cameras, or use ATM's as swipe cards. 
                         The cameras're our real security so 
                         he's a little demoralized.

               EXT. BUILDING 20/PARKING LOT - DAY

               As they walk, Milo watches two Hardhats roll a spool of fiber-
               optic cable into the building under construction.

                                     MILO
                         What're they building?

                                     REDMOND
                         #21. Way behind schedule. It's top-
                         secret, but everybody knows it's a 
                         digital broadcast space. They see 
                         the dishes on top, the fiber optics 
                         going in.

                                     MILO
                         Gary's not into fiber optics. He's 
                         betting everything on the satellites.

                                     REDMOND
                         You wanna survive in the software 
                         business, you cover your bets... I 
                         gotta say, this is the weirdest car 
                         anybody ever requested.

               They approach a 1990 Deux Chevaux, cheap but charming.

                         Oh, right. Your girlfriend's an 
                         artist.

               INT. BLDG. 20 CAFETERIA - DAY

               Blond wood, smoked glass -- a room as sleek as the Geeks who 
               lunch here are nerdy. Milo and Redmond push trays.

                                     REDMOND
                         I phoned her at your hotel, told her 
                         about our corporate housing options. 
                         She sounds neat.

               Lisa's at a table, looking at Milo. When their eyes meet, 
               she busies herself, placing the plates back on her tray.

                                     MILO
                         ...She is.
                              (turning away from 
                              Lisa)
                         She is!

               Lisa passes behind them, smiles fleetingly at Milo. At a 
               table, Randy and Phil note the "interaction." Meantime:

                                     REDMOND
                         'Might be some friction on the 
                         domestic front. You're expected you 
                         to put in ridiculous hours. People've 
                         accused us of breaking up 
                         relationships to get their undivided 
                         attention.

               He laughs.

               INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Lisa moves swiftly up the hall. She looks up it and down it 
               (making sure no one's looking) before ducking into

               MILO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               She goes to the box on Milo's desk (his personal effects) -- 
               starts rooting through it.

               INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

               Redmond and Milo have eaten; Redmond stacks their plates.

                                     REDMOND
                         Your counselor'll fill you in on 
                         everything else. That's who you'll 
                         be working with almost daily.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - LATER

               Milo has fed the old Skywire disks into his machine. He reads 
               a complicated screen.

                                     VOICE
                         Busy?

               Milo looks up. It's Gary. Milo is thrilled.

                                     MILO
                         No! Just waiting for my counselor to 
                         come by and introduce himself.

                                     GARY
                         Okay. I'm Gary.

               Milo's smile deepens. Gary notices the small painting (by 
               Alice) hanging on the wall. He stares at it.

                                     GARY
                         'Think I should buy some originals?

                         ...Do I?

                                     GARY
                         Somebody said I'm just another 
                         Philistine. With reproductions.

                                     MILO
                         That's insane. You're ahead of your 
                         time.

                                     GARY
                         That's what I told her. My wife.

               Milo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the 
               screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs. Boyd.

                                     GARY
                         'Thinks I'll be less of a control 
                         freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives 
                         me something else to obsess about...

               Milo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen.

                                     GARY
                         Anything we can salvage from the old 
                         code before you start fresh?

               Milo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor.

                                     MILO
                         Uh, might be one or two things.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. QUAD - OUTSIDE MILO'S OFFICE - LATER

               Two awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window.

                                     GEEK 1
                         He's been in there like an hour.

                         Shit.

               MILO SCROLLS THE SCREEN:

                         Could work with a new switch. There 
                         may be a few more things hidden.

                                     GARY
                         Don't spend too much time searching. 
                         You ever vetted somebody's old code 
                         before?
                              (when Milo shakes his

                         to the surface. The best-hidden 
                         secrets are in plain sight. You know 
                         the best place to hide a leaf, right?
                              (when Milo shakes his

                         In a tree.

               INT. EMPTY HOUSE - EVENING

               We're in an old (empty) Craftsman house. Through a front 
               window, we see Alice lead Milo up a path. As they enter:

                                     ALICE
                         ...The corporate condos were as 
                         romantic as they sound.

               Milo's grinning as he takes in the house.

               THE BEDROOM - MOMENT LATER

               Windows give onto a garden with a small studio. Milo's still 
               beaming, Alice is pleased. Till he says:

                                     MILO
                         You know he's never been anybody's 
                         counselor before?

                                     ALICE
                         Milo! What about --?

               She gestures at what she hopes will be their home.

                                     MILO
                         Oh, It's great. It's great!
                              (they start to kiss, 
                              but:)
                         'Think I should tell him I learned 
                         everything using 1.0? Maybe I could 
                         show him one of my early programs.

               She pulls him back into the kiss.

               MONTAGE W/ MUSIC

               1.) MILO types intently in his office.

               2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to 
               the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks.

               3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book.

               4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 
               1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled 
               on it. Gary seems touched.

               INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) 
               Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is 
               reading from a document:

                                     DOJ AGENT
                         "Infotek's urgent need to license 
                         Outpost Office is such that we can 
                         use it as a tool in the current 
                         negotiation."
                              (looks up)
                         When you wrote the word "tool," what'd 
                         you mean by it?

               Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed.

                                     GARY
                         I don't remember.

                                     DOJ AGENT
                         What d'you think you meant by it?

                                     GARY
                         I'm confused. Am I supposed to 
                         speculate under oath?

               The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's 
               negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, 
               while offering nothing).

                                     OTHER AGENT
                         Since you didn't have an answer to 
                         that question, Mr. Boyd --

                                     GARY
                              ("confused" again)
                         Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't 
                         remember."

               The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open 
               door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to 
               hide his annoyance:

                                     DOJ AGENT
                         Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd?

               INT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

               Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it.

                                     PHIL
                         Your protege's moving so fast we can 
                         barely keep up with him.

               Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.

                                     GARY
                         This is good. Who did it?

                                     PHIL
                         'Start-up not 50 miles from here. 
                         Kid's on Prozac.

                                     GARY
                         Maybe we should all get on it.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters.

                                     GARY
                         How's it going?

                                     MILO
                         Maybe I'm going too fast.

                                     GARY
                              (sharply; incredulous)
                         Too fast? At least four companies're 
                         on the verge of workable convergence 
                         systems, Milo, they --

               Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales.

                                     GARY
                         Even when I had a hand in every aspect 
                         of the company I knew the one thing 
                         you can never control is somebody's 
                         creative process.

               Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just 
               wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop 
               obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," 
               engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more 
               engrossing than Skywire?)

                                     MILO
                         It's okay. Really.

                                     GARY
                              (reaching into his 
                              pocket)
                         Take a look at this. Slightly 
                         different approach.

               Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow.

                                     MILO
                         You did this -- overnight?

               INT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               PAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled, 
               smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway.

                         gotta figure most people around here 
                         were their teachers' pets.

                                     MILO
                         ...Were you?

                                     LISA
                         We moved around so much I barely 
                         knew my teachers.

                                     MILO
                         Me too! Were you an Army brat or 
                         something?

                                     LISA
                         ...Something like that. Yeah.

                                     MILO
                         Didn't mean to pry. I just have this 
                         theory. Some of us who got to good 
                         at this? We were -- escaping 
                         something.

               This seems to jolt her. She pales a little. What a mysterious 
               girl. But this only adds to her allure.

                                     MILO
                         Did I say something?

                                     LISA
                         No, I know what you mean. I used to 
                         spend my life wishing people could 
                         be like computers. Least they make 
                         sense. Sometimes you think they've 
                         betrayed you. Like a person would. 
                         But then you see, no, you just missed 
                         a step. You can go back and make it 
                         all work.

               This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it.

                                     MILO
                         I used to wish that. All the time.

               They're looking at each other: he gets self-conscious.

                                     MILO
                              (re: the CD-ROM)
                         What've you got there?

                                     LISA
                         Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? 
                         I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.

                                     MILO
                         Show me.

               They sit. As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking 
               at her. On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the 
               logo appears. It's struck by a bolt from the sky. The outpost 
               comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its 
               windows, a ringing phone. Finally, the word SKYWIRE burns 
               into it. It's neat, she's really good.

                                     MILO
                         Cool!

                                     LISA
                         Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, 
                         ranging from the narrowest bandwidth 
                         to --

               Simultaneously, they reach for the mouse. Their hands touch. 
               They look at each other. Something happened.

                                     MILO
                         ...Sh-Show me the next one.

               She nods, manipulates the mouse. He stares at the screen 
               strenuously, fighting the impulse to stare at Lisa.

               INT. ANTEROOM - GARY'S OFFICE

               Gary's SECRETARY types as Milo enters. She smiles at him.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Have a seat. He's with someone, but 
                         I know he wants to see you.

               INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gary's face is red. The two Lawyers who sat in on his 
               deposition are with him again.

                                     LAWYER
                         Because we bundled it, the judge is 
                         threatening to enjoin the whole --

                                     GARY
                         I'm confused, Ted.

               Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of 
               ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending.

                                     GARY
                         Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter 
                         12 by the time they could hope to 
                         enjoin? I'm very confused, because 
                         you said they'd be ready to settle.

               ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo hears Gary yelling behind the closed door. It's 
               indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit!" Milo 
               flips through a copy of Wired, trying to ignore it. The 
               Lawyers come out, passing swiftly, rather grimly.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Go on in.
                              (when Milo looks 
                              dubious)
                         He's always happy to see you.

               INT. GARY'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

               Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, pens, 
               etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open 
               doorframe.

                                     GARY
                         Milo. What's up?

                                     MILO
                         Well -- you sent for me.

                                     GARY
                         Right... Right.

               Still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives 
               it to Milo. Once again, Milo marvels.

                                     MILO
                         You really wrote this just today?

                                     GARY
                              (dark, unsmiling)
                         What're you implying.

                                     MILO
                              (taken aback)
                         Nothing!

               Their eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair.

                                     GARY
                         Everything I do is under scrutiny. 
                         The questions they ask, trying to 
                         make anything strategic look sordid.
                              (knits his brow)
                         I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in 
                         business try to get ahead?

                                     MILO
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I'm sure.

                                     GARY
                         The purpose of this company isn't to 
                         destroy our competitors any more 
                         than the purpose of living is to 
                         breath. But the software business is 
                         binary: you're a zero or a one. Being 
                         obsessive isn't a crime. It's a 
                         character trait.

               Milo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide his 
               discomfort. Gary watches him.

                                     GARY
                         It scales, don't you think?

                                     MILO
                         Definitely.

               He smiles. For the first time it looks forced.

               INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse. 
               Alice looks great. The Waiter pours wine.

                                     ALICE
                         This feels fairly grown up, I'd say.

               Milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass.

                                     MILO
                         To our new life.
                              (she's looking at him)
                         ...What's wrong?

                                     ALICE
                         That's what I need to ask you.
                              (when he says nothing)
                         You know you can't keep anything 
                         from me.

                                     MILO
                         He gave me some new code-fixes this 
                         morning. I said, "Did you really do 
                         this just today?" Cause I was 
                         impressed. He said "What're you 
                         implying?"

               She just looks at him. He grows a little defensive:

                                     MILO
                         It's the way he said it. Just the 
                         way my dad did, when he was caught 
                         in a lie. That's how you knew you 
                         were onto something ugly.

                                     ALICE
                              (just confused)
                         What would it mean, anyway? If he 
                         didn't write it?

                                     MILO
                         That's what I'm asking myself. Does 
                         he have some genius stowed away? Why 
                         not let him write Skywire.
                              (upset)
                         'Not saying it makes sense.

               A Busboy leaves a basket of rolls. Glum, preoccupied, Milo 
               takes one without looking, brings it to his lips --

                                     ALICE
                         Milo!

               He looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches.

                                     MILO
                         I'm so stupid.

               He throws the roll back into the basket.

                                     ALICE
                         He's your boss. He's not your --

                              (he's nodding)
                         I know, I know.

                                     ALICE
                         If you can't deal with him on that 
                         basis, you better get a new counselor.

                                     MILO
                              (the very idea hurts)
                         Isn't that -- extreme?

                                     ALICE
                         What's extreme is what that ER doctor 
                         said when he pumped your stomach. 
                         Eat another sesame seed and that's 
                         it.

               We see the rolls: covered in seeds.

                                     ALICE
                         I mean, if one little comment from 
                         Gary is gonna upset you this much --

                                     MILO
                         You're right. It's -- a working 
                         relationship. Don't know what I was 
                         expecting.

               He smiles. But his heart's not in it. She hates to see him 
               suffer. She picks up her glass.

                                     ALICE
                         C'mon. Let's do the toast?

               EXT. TERRACE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY

               Milo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats. He 
               doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray.

                                     LISA
                         Did you wanna be alone?

                                     MILO
                         No. Please.

               He indicates she should sit.

                                     LISA
                         They just pushed up the schedule on 
                         Skywire apps. How fast are you going?

                                     MILO
                         "There is no second place." Plus 
                         every time I get jammed-up, Gary has 
                         an inspiration.
                              (looks at her, curious)
                         Is it like that with your counselor?

                                     LISA
                         Mine's not the CEO. He barely 
                         remembers to take a shower.

                                     MILO
                         Right, right. But does he ever just, 
                         like, hand you code?

                                     LISA
                         Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.

                                     MILO
                              (he smiles)
                         You're compulsive.

                         Mmm-more like -- I have a little 
                         trouble. Trusting people.

                                     MILO
                         Why's that?

                                     LISA
                         Long story. Not that interesting.

               She smiles charmingly to cover whatever she's feeling. The 
               more enigmatic she is, the more intrigued he is.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - DAY

               Milo and Lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with 
               Outpost logos. They laugh. We go nearer.

                                     MILO
                         So, when you were talking about 
                         wishing people were more like 
                         computers. Was that then? Or now?

                                     LISA
                         Then and now.
                              (when he looks at her)
                         But not right now.

               She maintains eye contact. Her meaning is clear.

                                     VOICE
                         Milo!

               Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot) 
               give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots 
               over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be 
               having been found in bed with a girl.

                                     BRIAN
                         Just dropped off a resume. Almost 
                         got in the front door.

               He looks at Lisa, back to Milo, wondering why he isn't being 
               introduced.

                                     MILO
                         You're living here?

                                     BRIAN
                         'Thought if I relocated it could 
                         help my case. I'm writing programs 
                         for the local public access station. 
                         Where any whack-job with 100 bucks 
                         gets his own show? God, does it suck.
                              (gives him a business 
                              card)
                         Can you help me?

                                     MILO
                         Sure, I'll see what I can do.

               Seeing how flushed Milo is, Brian thinks he must have 
               blundered in on something. He starts to back away.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well I parked illegally. See y'later?

                                     MILO
                              (watching Brian go)
                         'Forgot to introduce you.

                         That's great. I -- didn't know.

                                     MILO
                         She saved my life.

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The station is closed. Milo's car is parked, empty.

                                     MILO (O.S.)
                         How's it going down there?

               We find him, in an illuminated phone booth.

                                     TEDDY (ON THE PHONE)
                         I've been hacking for five night's 
                         straight, I'm really making headway.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. TEDDY'S LOFT (SUNNYVALE) - CONTINUOUS

               A funky space, posters on the wall, a red Stanford pennant, 
               rubber trees at either end of his desk.

                                     TEDDY
                         But these, like, White Supremacists 
                         trashed my office, last week.

                                     MILO
                         What?!

               On the wall beyond Teddy the word GOOK (in blood red) has 
               been covered over with paint but still bleeds through.

                                     TEDDY
                         They're in the neighborhood. They 
                         usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.

                                     MILO
                         Jesus, Teddy.

                                     TEDDY
                         I'm cool. They didn't touch the 
                         machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't 
                         know what they were. So, you a Moonie 
                         yet?
                              (he waits)
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         I met this girl.

                                     TEDDY
                         What? Come on. Is it serious?

                                     MILO
                         I don't know.

                                     TEDDY
                         Did you tell Alice?

                                     MILO
                         No! I keep thinking it'll go away. 
                         But there's this -- connection. She's 
                         been hacking since she was little, 
                         she had to move around a lot. Plus I 
                         see her every day, we're working on 
                         the same program. She's -- beautiful.

                                     TEDDY
                         A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound 
                         paranoid, or like a pig, but what're 
                         the chances?

                                     MILO
                         What d'you mean?

                                     TEDDY
                         I dunno. I guess Larry's got me 
                         totally suspicious of that place.

                                     MILO
                         What does that mean?

                                     TEDDY
                         Milo, geeks don't have two 
                         girlfriends. Most don't have one.

                                     MILO
                         I didn't plan this.

               EXT. BUILDING #20 QUAD - DAY

               Through a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad.

                                     GARY (O.S.)
                         What'd the girl say?

                                     PHIL
                         There may be a little less trust 
                         after your outburst.

               We are

               INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code.

                                     PHIL
                         Hasn't affected his work, though.

                                     GARY
                         Nothing does. Still. I want him to 
                         like me.

               Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary.

               EXT. BUILDING #20 PARKING LOT - EVENING

               Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo 
               to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems 
               to be -- apologizing.

               EXT./INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING

               Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice 
               what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is 
               waiting for him. She's white.

                                     MILO
                         ...What's wrong?

               She doesn't know how to say it.

                                     MILO
                         What!

                                     ALICE
                         Teddy was killed last night.

                                     MILO
                         What're you -- what?

                                     ALICE
                         It was a hate crime.

               Milo is staggered. She moves to him...

                                     ALICE
                         I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

               He hangs onto her, for support.

               EXT. SUNNYVALE LOFT BLDG. (SILICON VALLEY) - DAY

               Establish the funky building, vestiges of police tape on the 
               door, a limo and many cars parked out front.

               INT. LOFT - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

               A mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have 
               gathered. In the BG, Teddy's Dad weeps volubly.

               INT. TEDDY'S WORKSPACE - CONTINUOUS

               Teddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red 
               Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit, 
               peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall.

                                     NELSON
                         They trashed his hard disk, all his 
                         back-ups. Nothing's left.

                                     MILO
                         They caught the guys?

               Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin-
               headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's.

                                     NELSON
                         It's an airtight case. They found 
                         the weapon with Teddy's blood on it 
                         and their fingerprints. They'd been 
                         arrested twice for beating-up Asians. 
                         How come they weren't in jail?

               Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board.

                                     MILO
                         He told me about the break-in. He 
                         didn't seem to take it that seriously.

                                     NELSON
                         You guys don't take anything seriously 
                         do you? That's not on a hard drive?

               Milo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway.

                                     ALICE
                         Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's 
                         time to go to scatter the ashes.

               Milo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to 
               the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he 
               sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up.

                                     MILO
                         I didn't know he was working with 
                         fiber optics.

               But when he looks up, Nelson's gone.

                                     ALICE
                         We gotta go too, honey.

               As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the 
               filament in his suit pocket.

               EXT. BLUFF OVER THE PACIFIC - DAY

               A raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind 
               a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's 
               Prayer.

               EXT. BLUFF - LATER

               Milo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's 
               okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the 
               cars.

                                     MILO
                         I know you lost all his work. Maybe 
                         I could come down here and --

                                     LARRY
                         You are naive. Look at your employment 
                         contract: you can't work anywhere 
                         else in this field for at least few 
                         years.
                              (he smiles sadly)
                         Not that I don't miss you.

                                     MILO
                         Just thought his work should go on.

                                     LARRY
                         He was on the verge of something, 
                         too. He was gonna show us the next 
                         day. He said "The answer's not in 
                         the box, it's in the band." Know 
                         what it means?

                                     MILO
                         It's only meaningful when you've got 
                         40,000 lines of code to back it up.

                                     LARRY
                         Man, could he write code. Totally 
                         elegant. He had his own style.

                                     MILO
                         Those really weird, short lines.

               They smile. For a moment, they've brought Teddy back to life. 
               Alice comes up from behind, to fetch Milo.

                                     LARRY
                         Take good care of this guy.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 - DAY

               Arriving for work, Milo sees Outpost flags at half mast.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               As Milo comes up the hall, Lisa is standing there. We get 
               the feeling she's been waiting for him.

                                     LISA
                         You okay?

               He looks at her, perhaps hearing Teddy's words ("what're the 
               chances?"). He nods, moves on. She watches him head up the 
               hall.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY

               Milo types. There is a rapping on the doorframe. Gary.

                                     GARY
                         I heard what happened.

                                     MILO
                         Were the flags for Teddy?

               Gary nods. Spontaneously Milo stands, hugs Gary.

                                     GARY
                         Had you talked to him much lately?

                                     MILO
                         Just once. 'Guess I was worried we 
                         didn't have anything to talk about, 
                         since work was off-limits. Non-
                         disclosure.

                                     GARY
                         Did you?

                                     MILO
                         Talk about work? Never!

                                     GARY
                         I meant did you find other stuff to --

                                     MILO
                         Oh. Yeah.

                                     GARY
                         You've been coming in early.

                                     MILO
                         It helps. Alice said it would help. 
                         To focus on something.
                              (a little guilty)
                         'Don't know what I'd do without her.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

               Milo sits on the couch, in dim light. Alice comes in.

                                     ALICE
                         You okay?
                              (sits by him, holds 
                              him)
                         I miss him, too.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DINING ROOM TERRACE - DAY

               Milo eats alone. Through the window, he sees Lisa inside. 
               She's eating alone, too. Gary comes trotting up.

                                     GARY
                         Milo?

               He is unclasping a manila envelope; he takes pages out.

                                     MILO
                         Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of 
                         code there...

                                     GARY
                         34,000. But they're real short lines. 
                         'Just came out that way.

               Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of 
               like -- Teddy's.

                                     GARY
                         Been thinking about the push mechanism 
                         in the handler. And it came over me: 
                         it's in the wrong place.

                                     MILO
                              (an uncertain smile)
                         The wrong place?

                                     GARY
                         The answer's not in the box. It's in 
                         the band.

               Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a 
               reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but 
               Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the 
               very ground is going out from under him.

               Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And 
               Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the words 
               Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes.

               Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He 
               perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling, 
               saying "See you later." And he's gone.

               Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.

                                     LISA (O.S.)
                         Milo? You okay?

               It strikes him she always shows up at these moments. He 
               gathers his wits before looking up.

                                     MILO
                         Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something.

               INT./EXT. MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY

               Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits 
               HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's 
               about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded 
               on the receiver.

               He throws it down like it's contaminated.

               EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children. 
               Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle.

               EXT. INT./FRONT DOOR/FOYER - DAY

               He fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside:

                                     MILO
                         Alice? Alice!

               He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window, 
               painting in the studio.

               EXT./INT. BACK GARDEN/STUDIO - MOMENT LATER

               He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She 
               does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits 
               for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak.

               EXT. BACK GARDEN - LATER

               He paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but 
               doesn't want to appear unsympathetic.

                                     ALICE
                         Are you saying you think they had 
                         something to do with his death? Nelson 
                         said it was an airtight case.

                                     MILO
                         I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- 
                         maybe they hired those guys.

                                     ALICE
                         I can't see Outpost putting its 
                         reputation in the hands of people 
                         like that.

                                     MILO
                         I don't know! I just know it was 
                         Teddy's code. All these ideas flying 
                         in from everywhere. You know how he 
                         says "Any kid working in his garage 
                         can put us out of business?" It's 
                         like they know what every kid's doing.

                                     ALICE
                         They hack into people's programs?

                                     MILO
                         Nobody does work like this on-line. 
                         It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. 
                         Self-contained. They'd have to be, 
                         like, watching people. Physically.
                              (he freezes)
                         Oh Jesus.

               INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging 
               there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket. 
               He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic 
               strand (from Teddy's floor). Shows it to her.

                                     MILO
                              (almost silently)
                         It's a camera.

               EXT. BACK GARDEN - AGAIN

               They've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging 
               his paranoia.

                                     MILO
                         It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- 
                         a surveillance post or something. 
                         That's why they have the dishes on 
                         top.

                                     ALICE
                         You're scaring me. I think we should 
                         just go.

                                     MILO
                         Go where? You can't get away from 
                         people like this.

                                     ALICE
                         "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking 
                         about.

                                     MILO
                              (it really hurts)
                         You think I don't know that?

                                     ALICE
                         Milo. Why would he --

                                     MILO
                         How should I know? "Solving a 
                         problem," I guess. Or needing to 
                         control everything. I don't know.
                              (can't think about it)
                         I've gotta get in there.

                                     ALICE
                         Even if all this were true. There're 
                         20 other buildings. All of them filled 
                         with computers and --

                                     MILO
                         It's the only one with dishes on the 
                         roof. The studio's a front. That's 
                         why they keep postponing its opening.
                              (muttered, obsessive)
                         ...gotta get in there.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents 
                         are all over the place. How could 
                         they hope to hide a surveillance 
                         post?
                              (as he mulls this)
                         And how can you get in there, anyway? 
                         With the cameras and the swipe cards --

                                     MILO
                         I can't just walk away!

                                     ALICE
                         You can't just walk in, either.

                                     MILO
                         They stop the construction work at 
                         six or seven. The parking lot's mostly 
                         clear by two or three in the morning. 
                         Even the early Geeks don't get there 
                         before five.

                                     ALICE
                         Is it two? Or is it three? Have you 
                         ever really noticed?

               He knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a 
               space-cadet. She tries to hold him. But he wriggles away.

                                     MILO
                         No! I can't just keep my head in the 
                         sand. That's how I got into this 
                         mess.

               He paces, he thinks. She watches him, worried.

                                     MILO
                         I know how to get in there. But you've 
                         gotta help me.

                                     ALICE
                              (scared, reluctant)
                         ...Whaddo I do?

                                     MILO
                         So you believe me?

               She can't lie. She shakes her head.

                                     ALICE
                         Just tell me what to do.

               BEGIN MONTAGE:

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Standing at his window, Milo can see #21. Workers in Hardhats 
               come out of it, carrying lunchboxes. Milo holds a small 
               writing pad. He notes the time.

               EXT. SUBURBAN MAIN STREET - DAY (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice parks in front of a drugstore. As she gets out of the 
               car, she looks around uneasily.

               INT. DRUGSTORE - (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice is at the counter, buying a wind-up alarm clock.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT (CONT. MONTAGE)

               Milo watches a car pull out of the parking lot, leaving only 
               one or two others. He writes down the time.

               INT. TOYSTORE - (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice is at the counter, among children and mothers, 
               purchasing a chemistry set.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               He watches a SECURITY GUARD (DELBERT) go into #21 on his 
               rounds, notes the time: 3:45 AM.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S - STUDIO - NIGHT (CONTINUE MONTAGE)

               Alice, wearing dishwashing gloves, ties the alarm clock to a 
               small Tupperware container with copper wire.

               Milo (wearing latex gloves) is at the sink, mixing chemicals 
               from the toy chemistry set. Alice approaches with the 
               container affixed to the clock. As she holds it out Milo 
               pours the mixture into it.

                                                                SHORT FADE:

               OVER BLACK we hear ticking. The screen lightens to show:

               INT. SUPPLY CLOSET (BUILDING 20)

               Milo's alarm clock is set for 11:00. It sits amid mops and 
               cleaning products.

               INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - DAY

               Milo stands in the open door of a refrigerator, as if 
               searching for a soda. He's looking up the hall, waiting for 
               someone. He consults his watch. 10:53.

                                     MILO
                         Come on.

               Here comes a GUARD; he nods to Milo as he passes. The Guard 
               opens a door with his card. Milo rushes through the door on 
               the Guard's swipe -- "tailgating."

                                     GUARD
                         Sir, you gotta use your own --
                              (noticing)
                         Where's your ID?

               Milo cops an attitude. He's not completely convincing.

                                     MILO
                         Do you know who I am?

                                     GUARD
                         It's my job, I gotta --

                                     MILO
                              (he's getting better)
                         The kind of stock options I'm sitting 
                         on?

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Bob Shrot, the ex-cop in charge of physical security, looks 
               up as the Guard escorts Milo into the room.

               INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

               The bomb explodes. The blast is tiny but loud (glass cleaning 
               bottles ring; plastic bottles moan).

               INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo sits, watches Shrot encode a new card for him, finding 
               his info on a terminal. On a monitor behind Shrot, Milo sees 
               Programmers being ushered out of the building.

                                     SHROT
                         Every geek has to try this once to 
                         show me how smart he is --

               ANOTHER GUARD rushes in.

                                     ANOTHER GUARD
                         There was an explosion in a Y-sector 
                         closet, we're evacuating the whole 
                         sector.

               Shrot comes to his feet, grabs a holster (with gun) off a 
               shelf. Milo, looking flummoxed, stands.

                                     SHROT
                         Un-nh, can't wander around without 
                         ID now. Just park your ass in that 
                         chair.

               Milo sits. Shrot goes out with the Guard.

                                     GUARD (O.S.)
                         Whole place reeks of fuckin' ammonia.

               Milo moves quickly to the wall, reads a chart with the Guards' 
               Schedule, runs his finger down it til he finds the name of 
               the Guard on the 3 AM shift: DELBERT, KEN.

               INT. HALLWAYS - A FEW QUICK CUTS - CONTINUOUS

               Guards open closet doors, shine their flashlights.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo has moved to Shrot's seat. He's encoding a fresh card 
               with Ken Delbert's information.

               INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Panning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at 
               a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing 
               the system with his unique concentration.

               Panning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers 
               enjoying themselves on the lawn. It's a rare, exciting event: 
               they jump around, miming explosions.

               INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the 
               debris, puts them in a tray.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On 
               the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a 
               room under construction...

               He pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks 
               PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders 
               through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves 
               backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty 
               hallway), stops the tape.

               INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Gary, Randy & Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him.

                                     RANDY
                         What is it?

                                     SHROT
                         Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. 
                         Right by the civil defense sign? 
                         Some geek's idea of irony. I been 
                         saying we need a camera in this hall.

                                     RANDY
                         There's nothing in this hall. 
                         Someone's pulling your chain, as 
                         usual.

                                     SHROT
                              (thinking aloud)
                         Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in 
                         my office. He was tailgating, so I --

               Gary explodes, with incredulity.

                                     GARY
                         Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to 
                         think.

               Gary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned.

                                     RANDY
                         That kid's the great white hope.

                                     SHROT
                         I could get it out of him.

                                     RANDY
                         You're not listening.

               Randy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if 
               his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's 
               innocence, he isn't.

               He walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo reads a warning message. DOWNLOADING PLAYBACK STREAM TO 
               RECORD CYCLE WILL CAUSE BIT OVERLOAD. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED? 
               Y/N. He types Y.

               The glitch freezes the tape (we see it lock into place): it 
               shows the empty hallway.

               INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               They've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall 
               as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly.

               He knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make 
               cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo immobilizes another camera in #21... and another.

               INT. HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

               Shrot rounds the corner. His office is in view, now.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, at the keyboard, closes up windows, one by one.

               INT. SECURITY OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo. 
               We assume his POV as he does so:

               Milo sits in the chair where Shrot left him.

                                     MILO
                         Everything okay?

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Pan off the clock (3:20 AM) to find Milo at his desk, looking 
               at the clock with a certain dread. It's time.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - NIGHT

               Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling 
               nervously with the dummied swipe card.

               Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping 
               to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on.

               Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is 
               around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible 
               through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with 
               cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression 
               seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw 
               racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his 
               James Bond BMW...

               Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the 
               card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm?

               He slides the card, the door clicks.

               INT. BLDG. 21 - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               He enters: concrete floor, unpainted walls, construction 
               lights. At the inner door he looks up at the camera.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A MONITOR

               that shows us where Milo stands, minus Milo. Widen:

               INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               A GUARD packs up his stuff, getting ready to go home. The 
               new guard, KEN DELBERT enters.

                                     DELBERT
                         How's it goin'?

                                     GUARD
                              (shaking out his cup)
                         Big night. Switched from tea to 
                         coffee. Brought new meaning to my 
                         work.

                                     DELBERT
                         Yeah? Maybe I'll start my rounds 
                         with #21 tonight.

                                     GUARD
                         You are a wild man.

               INT. BLDG. 21 - INNER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls, bare floors, 
               unconnected wires. The only illumination is from construction 
               lights on the concrete floor. Opening doors, he sees:

               Bare rooms. Wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment, 
               bundles of wire hanging out. In other words: the building is 
               as advertised, so far.

               EXT. BUILDING 20 - NIGHT

               Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean-
               swept path that leads to #21.

               INT. BLDG. 21 - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Milo nears a set of double-doors at the end of the hall. He 
               hears a low ominous hum from within. Convinced he's found 
               something, he quickens his pace. He's about to swipe his 
               card when a beam of light bounces along the wall.

               He presses himself into an alcove. Through a chink in the 
               unfinished wall he sees:

               Delbert come in the front door. His rounds consist of shining 
               his torch up at the cameras, making sure the red lights are 
               on.

               He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath).

               Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the humming 
               gets louder.

               ON MILO: pressing himself into the alcove.

               Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall... exits the 
               building.

               Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall. 
               Using the card, he enters

               A BIG SPACE

               A studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed in 
               but not plaster-boarded. The portentous hum comes from around 
               a corner. He approaches, convinced the answer lies here. 
               Clearing the wall he sees:

               A squat emergency generator sitting on the floor, powering 
               construction lights. Something you'd buy at Sears.

               EXT. #21 ENTRANCE/A MOMENT LATER - (BINOCULAR SHOT)

               Through infra-red binoculars we see Milo come out, looking 
               left and right, to make sure he hasn't been observed.

                                     VOICE (RANDY)
                         Well. Now he knows: nothin' in there.

               We are

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS

               Randy turns back into the room, where Phil is sifting through 
               papers spread over a coffee table.

                                     RANDY
                         Maybe he'll get back to work.

                                     PHIL
                         Speaking of which...

                                     RANDY
                         Yeah, yeah.

               Randy pulls the blinds shut, joins Phil.

               EXT. QUAD - CRANE SHOT CONTINUOUS

               From a high angle, we track Milo, as he walks along the path 
               to a bench. The camera passes briefly behind a dark object 
               in the foreground (dog sculpture) as we track him.

               QUAD - TIGHTER - CONTINUOUS

               Milo sags onto the bench. He stares out, perplexed, suffering. 
               Then he knits his brow. He seems to be studying -- the ground.

               Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the 
               looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care.

               He stands up, turns around. REVERSE ON:

               The whimsical canine. Push toward it's ears cocked to the 
               sky... Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete, 
               but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal: 
               satellite dish.

                                     MILO
                              (muttering)
                         ...in a tree...

               EXT. DAY CARE CENTER - A MOMENT LATER

               At the entrance, Milo applies the swipe-card.

               INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

               He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. 
               Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, 
               into the

               COMPUTER ROOM

               20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed 
               table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no 
               expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital 
               screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour 
               drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). 
               There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of 
               the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).

               Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. 
               Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings 
               are of desks or tables with computers.

               Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a 
               workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant 
               at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. 
               Milo passes it. And comes back to it.

               Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still 
               occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the 
               bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- 
               numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is 
               a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his 
               frustration evident.

               As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the 
               screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve 
               into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in 
               Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).

               When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK 
               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the 
               screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All 
               of them show variations on a theme:

               A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a 
               programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various 
               shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed 
               view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are 
               present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A 
               Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Phil and Randy work at the coffee table.

                                     PHIL
                         Did you download Corey? In San Jose?

                                     RANDY
                         Damn. 'Have to go back over there.
                              (he stands, stretches)
                         Be so much easier if we could walk 
                         in the front door.

                                     PHIL
                         You don't look anything like a three-
                         year-old.

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and 
               obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a 
               graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: 
               TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.

               He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal 
               Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows 
               open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an 
               award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video 
               stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug-
               shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being 
               interrogated.

               In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld 
               crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. 
               "DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some 
               "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without 
               audio.

               He types some more.

               In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding 
               the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: 
               "Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter 
               Type PBX-R17."

               His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware 
               substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his 
               swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he 
               sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.

               INT. BUILDING 20 - SERVICE HALL - CONTINUOUS

               Randy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door 
               with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card.

               INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan 
               Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in 
               the 2nd window: a steel hasp.

               Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is 
               reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from 
               the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within.

               He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its 
               magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We 
               hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of 
               a serene, eminently sane female:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- run this methamphetamine lab known 
                         to Federal Authorities, per ND 47, 
                         from which we removed the implement, 
                         fingerprints intact.

               Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the 
               time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall 
               then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this 
               footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always 
               present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.)

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         FBI footage, procured by ND 47, shows 
                         the aftermath of an Aryan Nations' 
                         killing in Denver. Note the evidence 
                         of torture, which is typical.

               Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how 
               racial killings are done.

               He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls.

               It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel.

               INT. STAIRWELL/BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

               Still whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a 
               vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc.)

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing 
               at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- complete immersion in code-writing 
                         renders him both unobservant and 
                         suggestible [click]. On two occasions 
                         he went truant from classes to attend 
                         Comix Conventions.

               The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow: 
               he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking 
               to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro.

               What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost 
               urgently, till the narration crackles back on:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- Rebecca P, a Connecticut art stu- 
                         dent facing Federal drug charges, 
                         whose records were supplied to us by 
                         N.D. 47.

               He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen 
               Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo 
               subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what 
               his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR (O.S.)
                         Armed with his personal files, she 
                         was easily able to ingratiate herself 
                         with the socially maladroit Milo --

               The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and 
               ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's 
               waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, 
               Milo jams the card in deeper:

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         ...she planted the sesame seed both 
                         to test the extent of his proclivity 
                         and to provide a bonding experience, 
                         since she would quote "save his life."

               Milo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time ER 
               footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping, 
               dying...

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- should it be needed Milo's allergy 
                         is the ideal --

               The audio crackles out. But Milo doesn't have the heart to 
               bring it back: he can fill in the rest.

               INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

               Randy traverses a well-lit tunnel. Still whistling.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY CARE CENTER - NIGHT

               Numb now, Milo clicks randomly: crime footage, personal 
               records, animations -- it all flies by with Chuck Worman-
               like speed.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         Note that the cult members are found

                         alcohol [click] indistinguishable 
                         from kidney failure.

               Milo closes his eyes, leans back: overwhelmed. Suddenly he 
               sits forward, whispers almost fervently as he types:

                                     MILO
                         Please don't be one of them.

               INT. DAY-CARE - UNDERGROUND ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Camera moves slowly through stacks of pre-school supplies, 
               toward a windowed door at the back of the room.

               RANDY appears in the window, lit ominously from below. He 
               applies his swipe card.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo watches footage of Lisa taken by surveillance cam- eras: 
               she is outside #21, trying to peek in the door.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         ...needs to be watched, due to her 
                         heightened level of suspicion --

               In one window, footage of Lisa casing the hallway before 
               going into Milo's office; in another, footage of her eating 
               lunch with Milo.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         -- and to her possible contagion of 
                         key employees.

               Milo clicks. A MAN's pair of mug shots appear. In the other 
               window, a grade-school yearbook photo of Lisa.

                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR
                         In August '86 Lisa informed her mother 
                         of the sexual molestation by her 
                         stepfather, and of his threat to 
                         kill her should she tell anyone.

               Milo watches streaming local news footage of a man being 
               taken from a courtroom in shackles (jerky, grainy). He's 
               lost the audio, but doesn't need it, anymore.

               INT. DAY-CARE STAIRWELL

               Randy climbs up to the main floor... whistling.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo watches eerie crime-scene footage: a Girl with her throat 
               slashed.

               But then, hearing nearly-distant whistling, he clicks on 
               windows furiously: closing them.

               INT. DAY CARE BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Randy rounds a corner. He enters the

               COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The screens show the children's contour images, again. Where's 
               Milo?

               Randy takes a seat at the same console Milo was at, and begins 
               to type. Camera booms slowly down beneath table-level to 
               find:

               MILO hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white, 
               as he clings to metal table braces. The toes of his sneakers 
               are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower 
               and the table bottom.

               Randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward Milo's back. 
               Milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters.

               RANDY: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work, zooms in on 
               his screen to begin collecting his code.

               MILO: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow 
               and, worse, on his hands. They're giving way.

               RANDY: clicks. A printer across the room start making a hard-
               copy of the purloined code.

               MILO: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed 
               on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from 
               its ports. He tries to lift it back up with heels of his 
               shoes.

               RANDY: knits his brow as his screen flickers. He keeps typing, 
               but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the 
               table.

               MILO: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels, 
               while trying to maintain his balance...

               RANDY: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits 
               keys. Just as he is about to clear the level of the table -- 
               the screen re-illumines. He comes back up.

               MILO: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels 
               his hands slipping...

               RANDY: closes up the window...

               MILO: flops to the carpet(!) just as --

               RANDY pushes away from the table... From the floor

               MILO watches him walk over to the printer, collect his 
               hardcopy, and disappear from view.

               Milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes.

               BACK ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo traces Randy's steps. He sees the door with the Civil 
               Defense sticker, intuits how Randy got here, i.e, how one 
               moves, unobserved, between the Day Care and #20.

               He sags against the wall. Wondering what to do, now.

               EXT./INT. MILO'S CAR/STREET - DAWN

               Milo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up 
               the street. How can he go in there?

               He puts the car in gear, does a U-Turn.

               EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - SEATTLE - EARLY MORNING

               The Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government 
               building. Not many people are around, yet. A Janitor hoses 
               down the sidewalk.

               INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - RECEPTION AREA MORNING

               Milo slides a business card across a reception desk. It's 
               the one the rumpled Prosecutor, Lyle Barton, gave him that 
               day in Palo Alto.

                                     MILO (O.S.)
                         He gave me this. 'Said I should come 
                         see him if --

                                     DOJ RECEPTIONIST
                         He's not in yet.

                                     MILO
                         Can I wait in his office?

                                     DOJ RECEPTIONIST
                         It's locked, dear.

               He looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened.

                                     MILO
                         Please.

                                     DOJ RECEPTIONIST
                         Wait in his outer office.

               INT. BARTON'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

               Milo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping. Hearing Barton's 
               voice, he comes to his feet. Barton enters with a Co-Worker, 
               holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of 
               a case.

                                     CO-WORKER
                         Do I make the call, or do you?

               Milo is relieved the second he sees Barton's kindly face.

                                     MILO
                         Mr. Barton, do you remember me?

                                     BARTON
                         ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?

                                     MILO
                         Yes sir. I need to talk to you.

                                     BARTON
                         Give me two seconds with Lacy here?
                              (unlocks his door)
                         Go on in, I won't be a moment.

               Milo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague.

                                     BARTON (O.S.)
                         I'll make the call, but I think you 
                         need to send a Fax first (etc.).

               INT. BARTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo paces. He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and 
               photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity: 
               pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the 
               Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton 
               with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the photo, 
               till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey: 
               ND 47.

               Milo's smile fades. It takes a moment before he even hears 
               Barton behind him.

                                     BARTON
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

                                     BARTON
                         Have a seat.

               As Milo takes the seat in front of the desk (mind spinning) 
               Barton moves to his own chair.

                                     BARTON
                         What seems to be the problem? You 
                         look a little upset.

                                     MILO
                         I am. I am, sir.

               What's he gonna say?

                                     BARTON
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         My friend, my best friend, Teddy, 
                         was killed in Silicon Valley.

                                     BARTON
                         My goodness.

                                     MILO
                         It was racially motivated. He's 
                         Chinese. He was. And... I know 
                         sometimes the FBI gets involved with 
                         that. Don't they?

                                     BARTON
                         If there's a Civil Rights violation. 
                         But generally we let the local police 
                         and DA do their work first.

                                     MILO
                         I -- just wanna help bring these 
                         guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.

                                     BARTON
                         Let me look into it, see what's being 
                         done. Frankly, it's not my area.

                                     MILO
                              (he gets up)
                         'Just didn't know who else to talk 
                         to.

                                     BARTON
                              (circles an arm over 
                              Milo)
                         And Outpost? You're happy there?

                                     MILO
                         Yes sir.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Alice is on the phone in the front room. Agitated, she puffs 
               on a pencil (surrogate cigarette). We hear Phil through the 
               receiver:

                                     PHIL (ON THE PHONE)
                         'Didn't mention he was going to the 
                         Justice Department?

                                     ALICE
                         No.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                     PHIL
                         Not like him, is it? To do a thing 
                         like that without telling you. You're 
                         not losing your hold on him, are 
                         you?

                                     ALICE
                         He'll tell me when he gets home.

                                     PHIL
                         That'll be a test, won't it?

                                     ALICE
                         Instead of busting my chops you should 
                         do something about that girl. Fire 
                         her. Or something.

                                     PHIL
                         Lisa's an extremely valuable member 
                         of the Skywire team. We've got our 
                         eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.

                                     ALICE
                              (as she hangs up)
                         Prick.

               EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Milo comes up the path. He pauses as he nears the door: he's 
               not sure he can pull this off.

               INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               As Milo enters, Alice rushes to meet him.

                                     ALICE
                         It's almost nine, I've been so 
                         worried!
                              (she takes his hands)
                         What did you see in there?

                                     MILO
                         Nothing.

                                     ALICE
                         Nothing?

               She watches him as he collapses onto the couch.

                                     MILO
                         It's what they said it is. An 
                         unfinished broadcast studio. You 
                         were right... I just drove to Seattle 
                         and back.

                                     ALICE
                         ...Why?

                                     MILO
                         Remember Lyle Barton?

               She shakes her head.

                                     MILO
                         The Justice Department guy who came 
                         to the apartment when --

                                     ALICE
                         I remember.

                                     MILO
                         After I broke into 21 -- which was 
                         insane, thank God they didn't catch 
                         me! -- I just drove around. Trying 
                         to figure out what possessed me. You 
                         know what? I've been putting my own 
                         guilt on Gary.

                                     ALICE
                         Guilt?

                                     MILO
                              (quietly)
                         If I'd stayed down there, maybe this 
                         wouldn't've happened.

                                     ALICE
                         Poor baby. You know that's not true.

               She sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly. He 
               closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch. 
               Then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers.

               But he can't stand it. He gets up, looks out the window.

                                     MILO
                         I thought, instead of indulging all 
                         these paranoid delusions, risking my 
                         job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I 
                         should do something useful with my 
                         grief. Help them find Teddy's killers.

               He doesn't see her smile: is that all. Assuming an 
               appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him:

                                     ALICE
                         I was so worried about you.

               She turns him around, kisses him. Her eyes are closed. His 
               remain open. He's looking at her. Trying to comprehend the 
               treachery.

               She touches him, breathes heavily. She wants more than kisses: 
               to prove to herself how wrong Phil was, her professional 
               pride insulted. Or perhaps it's more personal than that, 
               especially with Lisa as a potential rival.

                                     MILO
                              (through their kisses)
                         ...been such a long night.

               But she doesn't stop. She moans as she presses herself to 
               him: wants proof of his devotion.

               INT. BEDROOM - LATER

               He's on top of her in the moment just after. Her eyes are 
               closed. He stares at her -- glares at her -- with what we 
               recognize as spent anger.

                                     ALICE
                         That was -- different.

                                     MILO
                         ...Different?

               Shit. She knows.

                                     ALICE
                         You didn't feel it? So intense.

               What's clear is, she liked it. A clap of thunder takes us 
               to:

               EXT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

               It's pouring. Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking 
               in the window at someone.

               INT. PIZZA PLACE - MOMENT LATER

               Lisa reads a paperback at a table, a slice of pizza on her 
               plate, an umbrella hooked to her chair. Sensing someone 
               standing over her, she looks up. She smiles.

                                     LISA
                         So you're not avoiding me.

               Milo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start.

                                     LISA
                         What's wrong?

               He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He 
               speaks very quietly.

                                     MILO
                         I snuck into #21.

                                     LISA
                         Why would you do a thing like --

                                     MILO
                         You thought about it too. You've 
                         been suspicious for a while. But 
                         it's not happening in there. It's 
                         happening in the Day Care.

                                     LISA
                         The Day Care?

               Two Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a 
               laptop case slung over his shoulder.

                                     MILO
                         Can we go someplace else?

               EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT

               They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off 
               the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace.

                                     MILO
                         It's easy to know who the smart geeks 
                         are, the schools tell 'em. They upload 
                         medical files, school records, 
                         pharmacy files. They'd be happy just 
                         to steal code forever. But when a 
                         program gets close to fruition. Like 
                         Teddy. He was almost there.

                                     LISA
                         But why would they --?

                                     MILO
                         You know. There is no second place. 
                         And what's the risk? The killings're  
                         undetectable, they're hand-tailored, 
                         they make "sense." I mean, they're 
                         in the information business. They 
                         have scenarios for all of us, too. 
                         In case we find out too much.

               She's peering at him. He reads her mind.

                                     MILO
                         I'm not one of them. Not trying to 
                         "suss you out."

               She wants to believe him.

                                     MILO
                         They killed my best friend! I'm living 
                         with somebody they pay to go to bed 
                         with me. Can't you trust somebody 
                         just once? I don't wanna be alone 
                         here.

               His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she 
               can't quite do it.

                                     LISA
                         I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry.

               She smiles sadly as she backs away.

                                     MILO
                              (forcefully)
                         I know why you're so secretive. Why 
                         you won't let anybody near you.
                              (quieter)
                         I know what he did to you.

                         Oh yeah?

               She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes.

                                     LISA
                         So that's in my -- file?

               He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She 
               shakes her head: no.

                                     LISA
                         Is that my -- scenario?
                              (when he hesitates)
                         Tell me.

                                     MILO
                         They'd frame him.

                                     LISA
                              (horrified)
                         He's out of prison?

                                     MILO
                              (he nods)
                         They're already watching you. If 
                         they had to, they'd give him this 
                         drug that mimics an alcoholic 
                         blackout. He'd wake up not even 
                         remembering his "act of revenge."

               She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She 
               weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing 
               her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses, 
               tries to back away.

                                     LISA
                         No.

               But he holds on.

                                     MILO
                         Nobody's gonna hurt you.

               Slowly, he wraps his arms around her.

               She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her 
               face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell. 
               After a moment:

                                     LISA
                         ...Milo?

                         Hmm?

                                     LISA
                         I always felt if a -- boy I liked 
                         ever found out -- he'd run. He'd 
                         think I was unclean.

                                     MILO
                         No, no. Never.

               She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust 
               breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame.

               A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm.

                         You're sure.

               She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch 
               her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a 
               remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake.

                                     ALICE
                         He said it made sense that Gary's 
                         code was like Teddy's, that that 
                         cliché about great minds was true. 
                         Said it was all about his own guilt.
                              (she shrugs)
                         Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary 
                         mixed-up with his dad once in a while. 
                         It always passes.

               Phil looks convinced. Gary doesn't.

               From across the highway (cars with morning commuters whiz 
               by) we see Milo pumping gas at a self-serve; Lisa fills-up 
               in the next lane. Ostensibly, they have run into each other 
               on the way to work. They are smiling, casual.

               Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions bear 
               no connection to their words.

                         maybe others. We tell the wrong

                         There's always a logical answer -- 
                         you just have to define the question.

               She defines it:

                                     LISA
                         How do you let go of a secret without 
                         telling the wrong person.

               She pretends to need help lifting her car hood: "a helpless 
               female." He comes over to help her.

                                     MILO
                         We don't tell anybody.
                              (she's puzzled)
                         We tell everybody. At once. So there's 
                         no secret left to protect. When 
                         everybody knows, they don't dare 
                         touch us.

                         ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. 
                         Only he didn't think he was. That 
                         applied to guys who didn't have a 
                         "system." "Losers," who played games 
                         of chance. He could "read" people, 
                         so chance had nothing to do with it. 
                         No matter how deep a hole he dug 
                         himself, he'd give you the whole

                         His creditors would catch up to him. 
                         Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake

                         Don't be so hard on yourself. With a 
                         brain like yours, you could connive 
                         with the best of 'em I bet.

               Gary smiles. There's no way to read it.

               EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Establish the humble building, in a Park.

               INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Lisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor. A Kid does 
               his homework on a computer at the next table. Milo shakes 
               his head, as he scrolls.

                                     MILO
                         He's buying up pretty much everything: 
                         cable companies, baby bells, picture 
                         libraries, museum rights, film 
                         archives... Getting ready for Skywire.

                                     LISA
                              (she's thinking)
                         What about "60 Minutes."

                                     MILO
                         Yeah, they dig stuff like this.
                              (he types, then reads)
                         "CBS News has partnered with Outpost 
                         Information Systems in a cable news 
                         network due to launch Fall of 2001."

                                     LISA
                         But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't 
                         love to break something like --

                                     MILO
                              (he's shaking his 
                              head)
                         Say there's just one "mole" working 
                         there, like Barton at the DOJ. How 
                         do we know he's not the guy we've 
                         contacted? Or she? Or the guy she 
                         works for?

               At the next table, she notices a Lady reading Time.

                                     LISA
                         Time?

                                     MILO
                              (types, reads)
                         Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake 
                         in Gary's set-top device. That also 
                         takes out CNN.
                              (scrolling & scrolling)
                         "GE joins Outpost in new venture," 
                         which means NBC is out. "Disney joins 
                         Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and 
                         Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. 
                         Any of these places could have a 
                         mole. Or all of 'em.
                              (still scrolling)
                         It's like a a continuous loop. We 
                         can go to some alternative press 
                         place that 1,000 people read, get 
                         them and us killed. But anything big 
                         enough for this is a parent of or a 
                         subsidiary to something Gary's got a 
                         finger in!

                                     HOMEWORK KID
                         Shhh.

                                     MILO
                         Sorry.

                                     LISA
                         Milo?

               She's thought of something. He's watching the nerdy Kid, 
               smiling sadly, perhaps identifying with him.

                                     LISA
                         How close are you?

                                     MILO
                         What?

                                     LISA
                         He's got 12 satellites up. He's got 
                         dishes on top of 21. He's building 
                         this --
                              (gestures at the screen)
                         mega-network for Skywire. Let's use 
                         it.

               Move in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of 
               excitement and skepticism.

               EXT. LIBRARY/PARK - NIGHT

               Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking 
               it through.

                                     MILO
                         We can't just assume they're standing 
                         by to receive Skywire 12 months from 
                         launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.

                                     LISA
                         A what?

                                     MILO
                         It's how on-line services push logos 
                         they wanna sell you. You don't ask 
                         for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to 
                         work on it somewhere besides my office 
                         or my house. And then the quality of 
                         the broadcast wouldn't exactly be 
                         digital, that's 12 months away.

                                     LISA
                         But they'd still get the idea, right?

                                     MILO
                         You'd have to design a graphic 
                         interface to make the data pop. Maybe 
                         some audio, too. To tie it all in to 
                         Gary. How long would that take you?

                                     LISA
                         It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a 
                         concept, it's maybe three day's work.

                                     MILO
                         Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We 
                         have to do this fast.

                                     LISA
                         Before they kill somebody else, too.

                                     MILO
                              (a new wrinkle)
                         Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's 
                         house. To get the satellite positions.

                                     LISA
                         You mean -- break in?

                                     MILO
                         I don't know --

                                     LISA
                         And what if the broadcast dishes on 
                         top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said 
                         the place isn't finished.

               The complications pile up. They walk. They think.

                                     LISA
                         I'll go look.
                              (when he looks dubious)
                         They'll just have a few more pictures 
                         of me snooping around.

               They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the 
               park, stop walking.

                                     MILO
                              (looks at her)
                         Why were you so careless?

                                     LISA
                         I thought the worst they would do is 
                         fire me. Who knew they took 
                         termination so literally?

               Gallows humor. What a game girl. He's nuts about her.

                                     MILO
                         Why were you snooping in my office?

                                     LISA
                         Oh.
                              (she gets bashful)
                         I liked you. I was checking you out.

               He kisses her. There are no constraints now, there's no 
               "adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Slow push-in on the phone on Milo's desk: it's ringing.

               INT. ALICE'S STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

               Alice is calling him. Her face hardens, she hangs up.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               As we pan the Best Western decor (in semi-darkness):

                                     MILO (O.S.)
                         'Think everybody in this place is 
                         here the same reason we are?

                                     LISA (O.S.)
                         'Cause their apartments might be 
                         bugged?

               Milo grins. He & Lisa lie in bed.

                                     MILO
                         I told Teddy about you.

                                     LISA
                         What'd he say?

                                     MILO
                         "A beautiful geek? What're the 
                         chances?"

               She smiles, rather bashfully.

                                     MILO
                         I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so 
                         much" to Alice. But even then I was 
                         starting to wonder. Is it so great 
                         to be so consumed by this one thing 
                         that you let another person do your 
                         thinking for you? If you have a 
                         lucrative skill, it's all anybody 
                         wants from you. You grow older but 
                         you don't grow up. You turn into -- 
                         into --

                         Gary.

               It's painful for him: losing a second father.

                                     MILO
                         Larry used to say how the guys who 
                         wrote the first cool operating 
                         systems, like the UNIX guys at 
                         Berkeley? They just gave it away. 
                         They figured it was human knowledge, 
                         it belonged to the world, like 
                         Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what 
                         I'm gonna do after we broadcast the 
                         incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire 
                         code. Then nobody can have a monopoly.

               INT. ALICE & MILO'S HOUSE - LATER

               Alice is in bed. In the darkness, Milo comes in as quietly 
               as possible. But she switches on the bedside lamp.

                                     ALICE
                         Where were you?
                              (holding his gaze)
                         You know you can't keep anything 
                         from me.

                                     MILO
                         Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... 
                         There's this amazing Comix store in 
                         Seattle.
                              (is she buying it?)
                         To tell you the truth, I did it once 
                         or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't 
                         keep anything from you...

               Of course she buys it: it's in the file.

                              (she smiles)
                         I won't turn you in.

               INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Morning TV is on in the kitchen. A Seattle station airs a 
               puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in formal 
               clothes (including Gary & his Wife) hold drinks and eat 
               canapés on the terrace over Lake Washington. (Gary's haircut 
               is different: it's file footage.)

                                     TV VOICE
                         Last years' party-goers pledged over 
                         $2 million to the Museum; this year's 
                         event promises to raise even more. 
                         Lured in part by the chance to see 
                         the stunning Boyd house...

               Alice, grinding coffee, isn't paying attention. Milo is.

                                     MILO
                         Look at this.

                                     ALICE
                         What?

                                     MILO
                         Why doesn't he ask us to his party. 
                         He's never even met you.

                                     ALICE
                         He has thousands of employees, Milo --

                                     MILO
                         It's for the Museum. He knows you're 
                         a painter. If anybody should be 
                         invited --

                                     ALICE
                         Milo --

                                     MILO
                         I know you think I'm too attached to 
                         him, but still. I am close to Gary. 
                         And you're the most meaningful person 
                         in my life.
                              (he gets up)
                         I'm going back to the Comix place, 
                         why should I be killing myself.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo, you --

               But he's out the door. She's not entirely displeased by such 
               a dramatic demonstration of his loyalty to her.

               EXT. BUILDING 21 - DAY

               Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish 
               to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box.

               Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in 
               broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and 
               two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable. 
               The needle on the meter dances.

                                     GUARD
                         Hey! Get down here!

               She was expecting to be busted. Still, she's scared.

               EXT. SAINT CATHERINE'S DAY SCHOOL - DAY

               A Catholic school on a wooded lane. Schoolgirls in uniform 
               play on the swings and hopscotch courts.

               INT. LIBRARY - SAINT CATHERINE'S

               Milo types madly on a four-year-old PC. It takes him a moment 
               to notice SISTER BEATRICE.

                                     MILO
                         This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed 
                         just before finals.

                                     SISTER BEATRICE
                         None of us knows how to use it. I'm 
                         thinking of taking a course.
                              (she wants to look)
                         May I?

                                     MILO
                         Sure.

               With her, we see the complex lines of code.

                                     SISTER BEATRICE
                         Forget it.

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Lisa sits with Bob Shrot. She's unfolding a page of sketch 
               paper.

                                     LISA
                         I needed t'see it up close for a 
                         graphic. The outpost with a dish on 
                         top? I climbed up there to get it 
                         right.

               She hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish. He looks 
               at her, at the drawing, at her again. She's scared, but tries 
               to hide it.

                                     SHROT
                              (hands back the drawing)
                         Next time you ask.

               Relieved, she gets up. The meter tumbles to the floor, thud. 
               She goes white. But when she looks up, she sees

               Shrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving 
               a printout.

                                     LEN
                         'Might of found something.

               Lisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len. As she goes out, 
               she hears:

                                     LEN
                         Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. 
                         Without leaving the first time.

                                     SHROT
                         Let's get him in here.

               INT. SEATTLE MONORAIL CAR - NIGHT

               Milo looks up as his train comes into a station. Lisa enters 
               the car, carrying a stack of comix. He stands, they kiss, he 
               takes the comix.

                                     MILO
                         Great. I knocked off the aglet, as 
                         soon as I get a passable version of 
                         Skywire we're there.

                                     LISA
                         The dishes are juiced up, too.

                                     MILO
                         Thank God.

                                     LISA
                         Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke 
                         into #21. I was in his office when 
                         he was reviewing the card readouts.

                                     MILO
                              (confused)
                         They know I broke in. Alice helped 
                         me.
                              (figuring it out)
                         Shrot's not one of them. He's 
                         blundering into this on his own.

                                     LISA
                         He doesn't know about the Day Care.

                                     MILO
                         Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty 
                         part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't 
                         bother with it, it's accessed by a 
                         tunnel they boast about. You know 
                         the best place to hide a leaf?

                                     LISA
                         Yeah, that's old, in a tree.

                                     MILO
                         Oh.

                                     LISA
                         Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody 
                         entered the Day Care at four A.M.? 
                         And tells them about it?

               They look at each other: the consequences of this discovery 
               would be deadly.

               INT. BUILDING 20 CAFETERIA - DAY

               A busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Programmers, 
               including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room.

               Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation 
               instantly drops out.

                                     GARY
                         Milo?

               Milo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation.

                                     GARY
                         I'm giving a benefit for the art 
                         museum Thursday night. Thought you'd 
                         like to bring Alice.

               Everybody at the table is listening.

                                     MILO
                         That's great! Thanks.

                                     GARY
                              (as he goes)
                         'Sorry about the late notice...

               Milo sits down. Everybody's looking at him.

                                     DESI
                         "Sorry about the late notice?"

               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

               Delbert is seated across from Shrot and Len. Shrot holds the 
               printout.

                                     SHROT
                         Why did you enter #21 twice?

                                     DELBERT
                         Huh?

               Shrot hands Delbert the printout. Delbert looks at it: dense 
               with coded entries. He stares at it.

                                     DELBERT
                         This thing's screwed-up. Look here.
                              (shows it to them)

                         that night. I never been in the Day 
                         Care.

               Shrot narrows his eyes...

               INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

               Milo sits with Lisa as she brings up the graphic interface 
               she's designed for the Skywire broadcast. It's an Outpost 
               desktop, with recognizable logos, fonts, etc.

                                     LISA
                         One window'll be obits I downloaded, 
                         based on the scenarios you described. 
                         The other windows'll accommodate the 
                         surveillance stuff you told me about. 
                         The idea is, this works with anything, 
                         since we can't edit.

               He nods. [It's not necessary for us to understand what she's 
               saying, just so Milo does.] She holds up an audio copy of 
               Gary's book, The Next Highway.

                                     LISA
                         Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: 
                         they'll play against any of the images 
                         you described.

                                     MILO
                         Perfect.
                              (something preys on 
                              his mind)
                         How am I gonna get away from the 
                         party long enough to --

                         You could always say you have to go 
                         the bathroom.

                                     MILO
                         That's lame, isn't it?

                                     LISA
                         You'll come up with something.

               He already looks nervous. We begin to hear live music.

               EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The music echoes from inside. Push past a line of cars and 
               limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of 
               it.

               Milo and Alice get out. As they go inside, she pulls a tag 
               from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

               As Milo and Alice enter, he sees a Balthus painting re-
               digitize to a Mondrian.

                                     ALICE
                         They called the house to ask who's 
                         your favorite painter.

               Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to 
               sneak away, now.

               They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep guests 
               from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass 
               through to get to Gary's workroom). A Guy in a pretentiously 
               hip tux tries to peek in.

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence 
                         is restricted.

               Milo looks a little more tense...

               PARTY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               The room is full of people. A long windowed wall has been 
               opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more Guests drink and 
               chat, and an orchestra plays.

               A giant Mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest 
               ID card. Milo sinks a little more.

               Across the room, Gary, his Wife (a blandly pretty blond) and 
               two Men are grouped around a Monet set on an antique easel 
               (thus clearly the real thing; Mrs. Boyd has prevailed.) Gary 
               notices the giant digital Mondrian.

               MILO takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray. He hands one 
               to Alice as Gary et. al. approach.

                                     GARY
                         Alice, I'm Gary. This is my wife, 
                         Clarissa.
                              (handshakes, etc.)
                         Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's 
                         visiting from Hollywood.

               LINDER is a short, tan man of 50.

                                     LINDER
                         I hate being the Hollywood guy. It's 
                         so limiting. Meet my friend, Ricky.

               RICKY is 25-years-old; he looks like a Polo model.

                                     RICKY

                         should meet.

                              (his mind elsewhere)
                         Cool.

               ANGLE: the orchestra, playing.

               ANGLE: a group of SOCIETY TYPES chatting.

                                     SOCIETY WOMAN
                         He's a sweetheart. He gave 10,000 
                         PC's to the Library Association.

                                     SOCIETY MAN
                         All 10,000 of which will be signed 
                         onto his browser, no doubt.

                                     SOCIETY WOMAN
                         And so what?!

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         Wait'll all the books are on-line.

                                     SOCIETY WOMAN
                         And so what?

               ANGLE: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky. 
               Milo looks utterly preoccupied...

                                     LINDER
                         The merchandising implications are 
                         epic. A kid's watching the movie, he 
                         points and clicks at the laser blaster -- 
                         before the reel's even over he's 
                         ordered the toy.

                                     ALICE
                         But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate -- 
                         won't that influence the content? 
                         Won't the artists complain? The 
                         directors or writers or whoever?

                                     LINDER
                         Artists? Darling, the only art left 
                         in America is business. You're in 
                         Picasso's house!

               Gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn't 
               heard any of it.

                                     MILO
                         Where's the bathroom?

                                     LINDER
                         The irreverence!

               Laughter.

               TRACK MILO as he wends his way through laughing, chatting 
               Guests, dread and determination on his face. He moves away 
               from us, enters the

               ENTRANCE HALL

               speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms.

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         You'll have to use one over there.

               He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door.

                                     MILO
                         There's like eight women waiting in 
                         line. They take forever.
                              (winces: painful 
                              bladder)
                         Please?

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Right here.

               He points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman 
               watches, Milo goes into the

               BATHROOM

               He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open 
               the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo 
               makes his move.

               DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far 
               end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably 
               appears.

               The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom 
               door, assumes Milo's still inside.

               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital 
               art, now a Bosch again.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS

               Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees 
               a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, 
               tastefully decorated rooms are blending together.

               He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. 
               Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly-
               appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich, 
               professionally-decorated taste.

               He's lost.

               He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.

               INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

               The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the 
               Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian.

               He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He 
               pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket.

               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts 
               toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he 
               sees:

               A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses 
               in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS

               A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees 
               Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a 
               direction, keeps moving.

               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he 
               slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music 
               echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled 
               with a Mondrian.

               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, 
               whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He 
               and Alice share a look as he moves off.

               We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through 
               Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he 
               hardly hears them.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT

               Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC 
               screen:

               LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East

               LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South

               ALTITUDE - 426 MILES

               He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next 
               satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up.

               Nobody's there.

               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS

               The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by 
               the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs 
               into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different 
               Mondrian, in a different room.

               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS

               Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He 
               moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.

               GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo still working...

               PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her 
               face sets grimly.

               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't 
               see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains 
               away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych.

               After a moment, Milo senses something.

               Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't 
               breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's.

               Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled 
               with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.

                                     GARY
                              (reading the screen)
                         "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working 
                         with you. I'd be lying if I didn't 
                         say I find you attractive. But in my 
                         heart I know that Alice..."
                              (he looks up)
                         You left my party to send E-mail?

                                     MILO
                         I couldn't do it at work cause of 
                         security or at home for -- obvious 
                         reasons.

               Gary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music 
               floats in from afar as the moment stretches.

                                     GARY
                         You could've handwritten it.

                                     MILO
                         I'm not much good at handwriting. Or 
                         parties.

                                     GARY
                         Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."

               This hangs there.

                                     MILO
                         Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude --

               The Second Houseman sticks his head in.

                                     HOUSEMAN
                         Everything OK, Mr. Boyd?

                                     GARY
                         No problem.
                              (when he's gone)
                         Is there?

                                     MILO
                         Gary, I --

                                     GARY
                         You see what's hanging on the wall?

               He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed 
               commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood 
               program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed.

               Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.

                                     GARY
                         I hope you know what you mean to me. 
                         Not just because of what you're doing. 
                         Because of who you are.

                                     MILO
                         I do know, Gary. I feel the same 
                         way. I thought I was coming here for 
                         a job. But it's meant a lot more.

               Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys 
               it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured 
               by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses.

               Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the 
               art books, vaguely looks through one.

                                     GARY
                         When will you have a Beta version?

               Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.

                                     MILO
                         I'm pretty close. But when I wrote 
                         the last contact switches, it wiped 
                         out a piece of the content filer. 
                         You know what it's like, writing 
                         software.

                                     GARY
                         I do know. You focus on the big 
                         problem. But somewhere down the chain, 
                         something breaks down. Something 
                         gets destroyed. At first it's 
                         upsetting. You feel you've lost 
                         control.

               Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo.

                                     GARY
                         So you have to remind yourself: it's 
                         just the process. Something's always 
                         lost along the way to anything 
                         worthwhile. Some little bug, some 
                         glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in 
                         that, you're doing something other 
                         people could never do. They lack the 
                         imagination, the brain, the nerve. 
                         Let them fret about every unforeseen 
                         consequence. You have to solve the 
                         problem. That's who you are.

               Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a 
               pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?

               EXT./INT DRIVEWAY/MILO'S CAR - LATER

               In the car, Milo and Alice pull away from the lights and 
               limos in icy silence. Several beats.

                                     ALICE
                         Are you gonna tell me where you went?

                                     MILO
                         I went to see the Skywire model in 
                         Gary's office. You know. Just to 
                         hold it again.

               He looks at her. She stares ahead, out the windshield.

                                     ALICE
                         Are you having an affair, Milo?

               He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice.

                                     MILO
                         No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, 
                         just now. To tell her how I feel 
                         about you.
                              (looks at her)
                         You know I'm clueless, without you. 
                         You know I --

                                     ALICE
                              (fighting tears)
                         Just shut up?

               Or is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them? 
               He's afraid, now.

               EXT. INT. DAY CARE - DAY

               Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard.

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

               We hear the children's shouts OS. Short, with a fingerprint 
               kit, is dusting the keyboards. Len stands over him.

                                     LEN
                         Get the backslash, the colon, keys 
                         kids don't use but geeks do.
                              (looking around, 
                              perplexed)
                         What would Milo want in here, anyway?

                                     SHROT
                         They know. 'Just they don't trust me 
                         with it. So we'll get the evidence, 
                         first, ask questions later.

               EXT. LIBRARY PARK - EVENING

               By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa.

                                     LISA
                         Does he know you know?

                                     MILO
                         He suspects I know something. I think 
                         he was sort of -- explaining himself 
                         to me, in case I do.
                              (he breathes)
                         We have to go in tonight. I'm two 
                         hours from a Beta version.
                              (knows she won't like 
                              it)
                         But I've gotta go home for an hour.

                                     LISA
                         Why?!

                                     MILO
                         She called to apologize. I said I 
                         was pulling an all-nighter. She said 
                         then come home just to say Hi. Which 
                         I always do when we fight, it's 
                         suspicious if I don't.

                                     LISA
                         Please don't go.

                                     MILO
                         At this point the worst thing I could 
                         do is anything out of the ordinary.

               She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her 
               backpack.

                                     LISA
                         Here's the interface.

               He takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried.

               EXT./INT. MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.

               He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen 
               in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her 
               hair is askew.

                                     ALICE
                         I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook, 
                         since we're always afraid for you to 
                         eat in Chinese restaurants. I've 
                         been mincing things into teeny-tiny 
                         pieces all afternoon.

               He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or 
               just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture?

                                     MILO
                         Great!

                                     ALICE
                         Look at me! I'm gonna change.

               When she turns away, we see the fear on his face.

               INT. THE BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Alice pulls into a dress.

               IN THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a 
               wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too 
               fine to discern one ingredient from another.

               BEDROOM

               Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon...

               KITCHEN

               Milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label 
               on a jar, the label on a can...

               BEDROOM

               Alice applies blush-on.

               KITCHEN

               Milo goes through the spice cabinet...

               LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom.

                                     MILO
                              (he smiles)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.

                                     MILO
                         ...What?

                                     ALICE
                         I know you. You're gonna run back to 
                         work right after dinner. I want my 
                         kiss now.

               Either she's the most cold-blooded woman in the world, or...

               He takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard -- as if 
               his life depended on it. When he releases her, she pretends 
               to swoon. She backs toward the kitchen.

                                     ALICE
                         Be right back.

               KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

               Camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big 
               bowl as Alice spoons the food into it... She sprinkles on 
               some final ingredient, also minced.

               DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo's fingers drum the table top...

               KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Alice picks up the dish. We don't see her face.

               ON THE DISH - MOVING - CONTINUOUS (ALICE'S POV)

               We hold the dish out in front of us. The food shines in the 
               light, a poisonous yellow gleam. We move from kitchen to 
               dining room, slowly, deliberately...

               Milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile. 
               We come all the way to the table with the dish, where Alice 
               sets it down.

               She sits. Milo, still vamping, pours wine. He picks up his 
               fork. Stares at it.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo?

               His mind churns furiously.

                                     ALICE
                         Milo?

                                     MILO
                         Don't we have any chopsticks?

                                     ALICE
                         Oh, right. Hold on.

               When she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the 
               tines of his fork against it, making score-marks, like those 
               used by allergists to test for sensitivity.

               He dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean. He stares 
               at it.

               INT. KITCHEN DRAWER - CONTINUOUS

               Alice roots through ladles, bottle openers, cheese graters, 
               spatulas. At the bottom of the drawer, she finds two pairs 
               of take-out chopsticks, wrapped in white paper.

               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo looks from his watch to his arm -- no reaction yet.

                                     MILO
                              (under his breath)
                         One more minute...

               But here's Alice. She slips into her seat.

                                     ALICE
                         Here we go.

                                     MILO
                         Great.

               He unwraps the chopsticks rather slowly.

                                     MILO
                         ...wanna savor this.

                                     ALICE
                         It's gonna get cold.

                                     MILO
                         Right. Wait. A toast.

                                     ALICE
                         You're just afraid to eat it.

               She smiles, picks up her glass.

                                     MILO
                         To the artist.

               They toast. She sips her wine. He sips his. He wants 
               desperately to glance at his inner arm once more. But she's 
               watching him, waiting for him to eat.

               He picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite. She 
               watches keenly. He brings the food to his mouth, passes it 
               between his lips, swallows.

               He closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact 
               bracing for a paroxysm.

               She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict on the 
               food, or for the first fatal spasm.

                                     MILO
                              (his voice cracks)
                         It's great. It's great.

               She grins. She takes a bite. The moment she looks away, he 
               turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear.

               The tracks are still flat, there's no redness. He shovels a 
               large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive. Then another 
               bite, greedy with life.

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT

               Shrot and Len are in a high-tech office. On a monitor, we 
               see a blown-up image of a fingerprint taken from Milo's 
               keyboard; Milo's name is printed under it.

               In a second window, other fingerprints flash by: thousands 
               of prints lifted off keyboards in the Day Care.

               Shrot waits for a match to click in.

               INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Milo scrolls his Skywire code, concentrating intensely. Till 
               he feels some stickiness on his thumb and forefinger. He 
               rubs them together, peers at his keys.

               Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder.

               Fear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a 
               bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it 
               in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case.

               INT. BLDG. 20 HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

               Milo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bumps 
               into Gary's Secretary.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Milo, hi! How was the party?

                                     MILO
                         Great! Great! Thanks for asking!

               He continues up the hall. He ducks into the service hall.

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot watches as

               The computer produces an alarm-like buzzing. The second window 
               locks onto the matching print. The prints flash in unison, 
               garishly confirming the match.

               INT. TUNNEL/STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

               Milo races along the tunnel that leads from #20 to the Day 
               Care...

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot punches a number on the phone.

                                     LEN
                         You calling Phil and Randy?

                                     SHROT
                         I'm calling Gary.

               INT. STAIRWELL/DAY CARE BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo climbs the stairs, fumbles with the swipecard, enters 
               the Day Care.

               INT. COMPUTER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Len is at the console. On a security monitor, he has called-
               up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, almost 
               running into Gary's Secretary.

               Shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone.

                                     SHROT
                         He's left his office, we think he's 
                         gone back to the Day Care for some 
                         reason. Can you tell me why, Gary?
                              (he listens)
                         Whatever you say.
                              (hangs up angrily)
                         Wants to consult with Phil. Was it 
                         Phil's idea to run the fingerprints?

               Shrot straps on his service revolver as he heads out.

                                     SHROT
                         Come with me.

                                     LEN
                              (trying to catch up)
                         Where we going?

               INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo is under the table, detaching one of the the black 
               plastic data towers that contain the "primers," stored 
               surveillance material, etc.

               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Phil hangs up the phone. He turns to Randy, who is with the 
               two men: the blond GUNTHER, the pale-eyed RIMAN.

                                     PHIL
                         He's in the Day Care.

               INT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo carefully detaches a second data tower.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 - CONTINUOUS

               Shrot and Len hurry out of the building, toward the Day Care 
               across the quad. Len is ill-at-ease:

                                     LEN
                         Bob, I'm a programmer, not a cop.

               In his haste, Shrot doesn't even hear him.

               INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Gunther, Riman & Randy head down the service hallway, en 
               route to the bomb shelter stairs.

               INT. DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS

               Milo, lugging one bulky black data tower under each arm 
               (wondering if he should just ditch one) gets as far as the 
               main, colorfully-carpeted room --

               Shrot is there, gun drawn. Len stands just behind.

                                     SHROT
                         What are you doing?

                                     MILO
                         You're better off not knowing.

               Shrot thinks he's being mocked, as usual.

                                     SHROT
                         What're you doing?!

               Milo sets down one of the towers.

                                     MILO
                         They're surveilling programmers from 
                         in here. They steal their code. 
                         Sometimes -- I know this sounds insane -- 
                         sometimes they kill one.

               Shrot looks skeptical.

                                     MILO
                         They let me break into 21. 'Cause 
                         there's nothing in there. You know 
                         they've been keeping things from 
                         you. 'Getting in the way when you 
                         try t'do your job. That's why you 
                         never told 'em your suspicions about 
                         me. Right?

               Shrot doesn't deny it.

                                     MILO
                         If you had I'd be dead now.

               Milo's sincerity is striking. Shrot cogitates.

                         We're too late. Take a look.

               He shines his light under the table, where the towers have 
               been detached.

               Milo hurries away from the Day Care. He has just one data 
               tower, now, so he can move faster.

               Randy starts to push past Shrot --

                         He must be out there still --

               He gets to the front room, where the jettisoned data tower 
               still sits (but he doesn't see it).

                                     SHROT
                              (calling after)
                         Forget about it. His car's not in 
                         the lot, he's gone!

               Shrot watches anxiously to see if he's stopped Randy.

               Milo moves low among the high-priced cars, lugging the tower. 
               He gets to his Deux Chevaux, opens the trunk --

                         Hey!

               Milo turns. It's Desi, again.

                         Maybe another time.

               As calmly as possible, he stows the tower, slams the trunk, 
               gets in the car.

                         out he was mucking around in here in

               When he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite 
               dish through the windshield.

               As the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a 
               sign that says KNQR - PUBLIC ACCESS.

               Milo rushes in, lugging the tower. There's a linoleum floor, 
               framed one-sheets for tacky public access shows (Yoga, blow-
               dried Evangelist, Nude Talk Show). Behind the reception desk 
               sits a beefy RENT-A-GUARD with an earring.

                         you? That's your dream in life.

               Brian is examining the data tower. He touches the Outpost 
               logo branded into it, rather reverently.

               Lisa comes in, laptop slung over her arm.

                         in the Valley after this. We're gonna

               Brian's thinking it over. He shrugs.

               "ER" plays, uninterrupted, Dan Rather, Diane Sawyer on ABC, 
               the Yoga lady, the audio of all four blending in a chaotic

               Gunther knits his brow. He notices Milo: still staring at 
               the TV screens.

               Milo's gaze stays fixed to the screens. Riman grabs him by 
               the shirt. But Gunther's concerned by Milo's behavior:

               As Milo watches the screens, a pixilated, ghostly image begins 
               to appear on all of them: the animated Skywire logo (lightning 
               strike, etc.).

               colors. [This is the all-purpose interface Lisa created for 
               to Milo.] A window at the top shows a succession of Obituaries 
               with photos Lisa has downloaded from newspapers: "Programmer 
               Dies in Highway Crash;" "Programmer Among Cult Suicides;" 
               "Programmer Victim of Racial Killing," etc.) The obituaries -- 
               eight of them -- fade up and down in a continuous cycle. 
               Meantime:

               Lower on the screen, the material from the day-care data 
               tower appears, following the same succession we saw when 
               Milo brought up Teddy's data, i.e., footage of a young 
               Programmer at college, surveillance footage of him typing 
               away (from behind), medical records that describe his 
               vulnerability or a crime primer that describes his scenario. 
               Between the obits and the primers, cause and effect is 
               (eventually) established.

               The crowning note is the audio, Gary in VOICE OVER, gleaned 
               (by Lisa) from the audio version of his own book:

                                     GARY'S VOICE OVER
                         Most of us who write software achieve 
                         our greatest work before age 30. As 
                         I grow older I know how important it 
                         is to access fertile young minds!

               A MONTAGE

               1. MOVE PAST ROWS & ROWS OF PC's playing surveillance footage, 
               a crash-scene upload, and an obituary, in a college computer 
               lab. Students watch, agog.

                                     GARY'S VOICE OVER
                         We work hard to stay ahead because 
                         we know any kid working in his garage 
                         can put us out of business.

               2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned 
               necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop. 
               In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in 
               the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the 
               Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, 
               sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear).

                         The first rule of the software 
                         business is: those who don't innovate 
                         are doomed to die.

               3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians 
               flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. 
               At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over 
               the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks 
               as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a 
               STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a 
               STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision 
               behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, 
               a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage 
               for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost 
               '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day 
               Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy 
               moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic 
               hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data.

               Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration:

                         That's why we work so hard to invent 
                         or acquire great new applications. 
                         Consumers don't care where new ideas 
                         come from, just so long as they're 
                         offered at competitive prices. Isn't 
                         that what the free market's about? 
                         Sure, we like being #1, but it's 
                         pressure, too. This business is 
                         binary: you're a zero or a one.

               In one window, the Skywire code scrolls slowly past. In the

                                     LARRY
                         Your app kind of blew mine out of 
                         the water.

                                     MILO
                              (he shrugs)
                         We'll come up with the next big thing.

                                     LARRY
                         ...You wanna work -- here?

                                     MILO
                         Got out of my other commitment.

               Larry hugs Milo. Turns to Lisa:

                                     LARRY
                         May I?

               He hugs Lisa, too. A Mover grabs Milo's backpack from the 
               floor.

                                     MILO
                         Hey, wait!
                              (when the Mover looks)
                         Not giving everything away.

               The Mover sets it down, moves on.

                                     LARRY
                         C'mon. Bring your stuff.

               Milo grabs up his pack, the three of them head away from 
               camera.

                                     LARRY
                         You guys'll be using Teddy's old 
                         space, is that okay?

                                     MILO
                         Cool.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

		Original screenplay by John Milius.

		December 3, 1975.



	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


	2  TITLE SEQUENCE

	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

				CHARLIE
		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

				LAWYER
		What about oil ?

				CHARLIE
		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

				ACCOUNTANT
		What's to prevent it ?

				CHARLIE
		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your
	If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you
	protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with
	we should have the respect			your knee... but you
	of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with
	takes another war.				your pinky.

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
	MOVE CLOSER.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

							DISSOLVE TO :

	4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

	A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
	shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
	Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		But I know how it started
		for me -- I was on R. and R.
		in Saigon; my first time south
		of the DMZ in three months. I
		wasn't sure, but I thought this
		guy was following me.

	Willard looks back.


	5  HIS VIEW

	an American CIVILIAN.


	6  MED. VIEW

	Willard ducks into a bar.


	7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

				CAPTAIN
		How about a drink ?

				WILLARD
		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

				CAPTAIN
		Winning the war by yourself.

				WILLARD
			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

				CAPTAIN
		Which part is that ?

				WILLARD
		My part.
			(TO THE WAITER)
		Beer, with ice and water.

	   
				CAPTAIN
		That's good gin.

				WILLARD
		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

				CAPTAIN
		Delta ?

				WILLARD
		No.

				CAPTAIN
		North ?

				WILLARD
		Yeah. Way north.

				CAPTAIN
		What unit were you with ?

				WILLARD
		None.

				CAPTAIN
		Rangers, eh?

				WILLARD
		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

				CAPTAIN
		Were you Longe Range Recon --

				WILLARD
		No -- I worked too far north for
		LRRP.

	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

				CAPTAIN
		That's quite an array of ribbons...

				WILLARD
		Let's talk about you.

				CAPTAIN
		I was an FO for the 25th.

				WILLARD
		Tracks ?

				CAPTAIN
		Yeah.

				WILLARD
		Fat. That's real fat.

				CAPTAIN
		Sometimes.

				WILLARD
		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

				CAPTAIN
		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

				WILLARD
		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

				CAPTAIN
		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

				WILLARD
		We do.

				CAPTAIN
		How long were you up there ?

				WILLARD
		A long time.

				CAPTAIN
		A year ? Waiter another beer.

				WILLARD
		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

				CIVILIAN
			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

				WILLARD
		Whose orders ?

				CAPTAIN
		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

				WILLARD
		Who are you ?

				CIVILIAN
		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

				WILLARD
		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

				COLONEL (O.S.)
		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

				COLONEL
		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		This gentleman or myself ?

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

				WILLARD
		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

				MAJOR
		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

				COLONEL
		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

				WILLARD
		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

				COLONEL
		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

				MAJOR
		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

				CIVILIAN
			(stopping him)
		Major.

				COLONEL
		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

				COLONEL
		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
	
		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


	11  MED VIEW

				COLONEL
		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

				MAJOR
		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

				COLONEL
		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

				MAJOR
		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

				WILLARD
		Who ?

				MAJOR
		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

				WILLARD
		Why me ?

				MAJOR
		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				COLONEL
		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

				VOICE (ON TAPE)
		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

				SECOND VOICE
		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

				THIRD VOICE
		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

				MAJOR
		That's Colonel Kurtz.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
			(STATIC)
		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

				WILLARD
		I only met Kurtz once.

				CIVILIAN
		Would he remember you ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				COLONEL
		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

				CIVILIAN
		You didn't like him.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

				COLONEL
		A lame ?

				WILLARD
		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

				COLONEL
		About what ?

				WILLARD
		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

				COLONEL
		But why ?

				WILLARD
		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

				COLONEL
		Well, he's killing now.

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				CIVILIAN
		What does that mean ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

				COLONEL
		It's got to be Kurtz.

				CIVILIAN
		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

				WILLARD
		Our Recon flight ?

				CIVILIAN
		Ours.

				WILLARD
		Touchy.

				CIVILIAN
		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

				WILLARD
		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

				CIVILIAN
		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

				WILLARD
		Terminate ?

				CIVILIAN
		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


	13  MED. VIEW

	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
			
				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for

		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --

		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

				WILLARD
		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

	The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the
	top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.


	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

	16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

	The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --
	the sea is calm again.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

				CHIEF
		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

				WILLARD
		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

				CHIEF
		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

				WILLARD
		Shot himself. What for ?

				CHIEF
		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

				WILLARD
		Arch light.

				CHEF
		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

				CHIEF
		Anybody see some smoke ?

				CLEAN
		Too far inland.

				LANCE
		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
	of the distant B-52 BOMBING.


	21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD

	studying, examining a report.


	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

	MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
		 
	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

				LANCE
		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

				LANCE
		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

				CHIEF
		Poor bastards, have a long year
		to go.

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

				SERGEANT
		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

				WILLARD
		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

				SERGEANT
		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

				WILLARD
		Right now -- I am.

				SERGEANT
		Well who the hell verifies that ?

				WILLARD
		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

				CHIEF
		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

				SERGEANT
		The show --

				WILLARD
		What show ?

				SERGEANT
		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

				WILLARD
		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

				SERGEANT
		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

				CHIEF
		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

							DISSOLVE TO :


	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


	29 FORWARD AREA

	jammed in the crowd

				CHEF
		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

				CHIEF
		What cat  ?

				CLEAN
		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

				CHIEF
		I never heard about that.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

				CHEF
		So what happened ?

				CLEAN
		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

				CHEF
		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

				CLEAN
		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

				CHIEF
		They nail him for it bad ?

				CLEAN
		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

				AGENT
		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

							CUT TO:


	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
	boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

				CHIEF
		Smoke !

				WILLARD
		Where ?

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

				WILLARD
		Black smoke ... secondary burning.

	The Chief grabs field glasses.

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- fishing village --
		helicopters over there. Hueys,
		lots of 'em.

				WILLARD
		First Air Cavalry. They're the
		ones gonna get us into the River.


	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
	trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


	37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He was not quite prepared for this.


	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

				KILGORE
		Bring me some cards.

				GUARD
		Sir ?

				KILGORE
		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

				WILLARD
			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand
		the nature of my mission.

				KILGORE
			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way
		till this is done, Captain.

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


	39  TRACKING VIEW

	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.


	40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

				KILGORE
		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

				LANCE
		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

				KILGORE
		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

				LANCE
		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

				KILGORE
		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

				LANCE
		Thank you, sir.

				KILGORE
		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.


	41 VIEW ON WILLARD

	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

				WILLARD
		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

				KILGORE
		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				KILGORE
		Where've you been riding, Lance?

				LANCE
		I haven't surfed since I got here.

				KILGORE
		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

	Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

				WILLARD
		I got bored in Saigon.

				KILGORE
		What's the furthest you been
		in?

				WILLARD
		Haiphong.

				KILGORE
		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

				WILLARD
		No. Walked.

				KILGORE
		What'd you do for supplies?

				WILLARD
			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

				KILGORE
		Can you trust them?

				WILLARD
		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

				KILGORE
		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

				WILLARD
		When did you hear?

				KILGORE
		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

				WILLARD
		Who knows.

				KILGORE
		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		Don't you agree?

				WILLARD
		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

				KILGORE
		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

				WILLARD
		Hairy ?

				KILGORE
		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

				WILLARD
		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

				KILGORE
		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

				WILLARD
		You'll find enough Cong up there.

				KILGORE
		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
		names all sound the same.

	He motions to one of his surfers.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

				MIKE
		Boss left.

				KILGORE
		What do you mean?

				MIKE
		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

				LANCE
		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

				MIKE
		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

				KILGORE
		How big it is?

				MIKE
		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

				LANCE
		Boss. What's the wind like.

				MIKE
		Light off shore -- really hollow.

				WILLARD
		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

				CHIEF
		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

				KILGORE
		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

				TOM
		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

				KILGORE
			(hard)
		What is it?

				TOM
		Well, I mean it's hairy in there
		-- it's Charlie's point.

	Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

				WILLARD
		Charlie don't surf.

	CLOSE SHOTS of rocket pods -- mini-guns in bizarre
	looking mounts.

	CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the
	command helicopter, next to the fearsome weaponry.

	And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
	very few of them really scared -- they fondle their
	rifles, grenade launchers, anti-personnel grenades,
	claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers;
	M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars
	and bayonets.


	50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

	Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch
	the waves -- then he sits back relaxed.

				KILGORE
			(to Willard)
		We'll come in low out of the rising
		sun -- We'll put on the music about 
		a mile out.

				WILLARD
		Music?

				KILGORE
		Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares
		the hell out of the slopes -- the
		boys love it.


	51  MED. SHOT

	POV behind the PILOT and CO-PILOT -- the ocean rushes
	below.

				PILOT
		Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust --
		turn on coordinates 1-0 -- niner,
		assume attack formation.

	The helicopter banks into a tight turn and bears
	toward the coast.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Eagle Thrust formation target
		2800 yards -- begin psch-war
		operations.


	52  CLOSE SHOT - LOUDSPEAKERS

	The ocean rushes below as suddenly the LOUDSPEAKERS
	BLARE out Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."


	53  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	From the water we SEE the massive grouping of Hueys -- gun-
	ships -- troop carriers -- medevac and recon -- ROAR over
	low in battle formation BLARING out "Ride of the Valkyries."


	54  INT. HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT -CREW

	POV behind pilot --

				PILOT
		700 -- 600 yards -- 500 --
		Commence firing.

	The whole copter shakes.


	55  EXT. VIET CONG FISHING VILLAGE - FULL SHOT

	A Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the
	beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind. This
	village commands a delta where ocean and river merge.

	Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being
	unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling
	about.

	Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;
	they stare out to see. Men scream orders -- women run
	from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere
	there is activity to prepare for the defense of the
	village.

	Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements.
	People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run
	to tunnels and trenches.

	The MUSIC GROWS LOUDER with the FAINT SOUND of ROTORS


	56  EXT. THE HELICOPTER FORMATION - AERIAL VIEW

	coming directly at us; WAGNER BLARING.


	57  HIGH ANGLE

	looking down through the helicopters as they approach

	POV behind pilot

				PILOT
		700 yards -- 600 -- 500 --
		commence firing.

	The whole copter shakes.


	59  EXT. HELICOPTERS - MONTAGE

	We SEE rockets ROAR from pods -- MACHINE GUNS RATTLE --
	grenade launchers POUND away -- and MINI-GUNS pour
	streams of lead and tracers with the SOUND of a DIESEL
	HORN.


	60  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach
	streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground
	is alive with smoke and fire -- a hut EXPLODES. The
	leads ship banks sharply up over the trees -- men run
	below SHOOTING back.


	61  MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT

	EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the
	COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES
	frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE
	rips around. The gunner is blown away.


	62  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS
	FIRING into the village.


	63  MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER

	The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the
	head with his .38, then ducks back in.

				CO-PILOT
		We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're
		hit. We got a hot L.Z. here.

	BULLETS RIP through the plexiglass. The Pilot FIRES
	back.

				CO-PILOT
			(continuing)
		Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate
		air strike on the tree line, Eagle
		Thrust.


	64  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, KILGORE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore has R.T. equipment -- he leans out near the
	door gunner.

				KILGORE
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four
		-- bring it in on along tree line
		and huts.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke

				KILGORE
		Haven't got time, Hell's Angels --
		lay it right up the tree line.


	65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON

	Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the
	coast.


	66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE

				KILGORE
		Fucking savages.
			
				WILLARD
		Who?
	
				KILGORE
		The enemy. Who else?


	67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS

	The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange
	napalm along the trees.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(on radio)
		Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest
		you follow with cannon fire.


	68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT

	They circle the battle.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		This is Baker Delta Four --
		Captain hit bad -- need dust-off.
		Receiving heavy automatic weapons
		fire from huts about thirty yards
		to our left.

				KILGORE
		Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four
		-- hold -- we're right over you.

	He turns to door gunner.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Right along the doors, boy.

	The gunner FIRES leaning out --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Fine... fine... little higher.
		Through the roof; yeah, that's
		good.

	He leans back in.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Didn't anybody bring me any
		bombs, grenades, claymores or
		anything?

				LIEUTENANT
		You didn't tell me to, sir.

				KILGORE
			(grumbling)
		You shoulda known.

	Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
	SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
	is thrown down where he hangs on.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

				WILLARD
		Automatic weapons flashes along
		those trees -- probably eleven
		millimeter guns and AK-47's.

				KILGORE
		The trees, eh...

	He grabs the R.T.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke
		Six. Join me in sparaying some
		trees.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're
		even got some rockets left.

				KILGORE
		Take her in low, Lieutenant.


	69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS

	The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast
	the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around
	them -- they scream and fall FIRING back.


	70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows
	them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of
	them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third.

				KILGORE
		Hold it, boy.

	He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
	back inside.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Take her up to 300 feet,
		Lieutenant.

	They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
	all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
	steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
	harness.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Rifle.

	A hand passes him a M-16.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; hard)
		My rifle, soldier.

	There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
	Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
	inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
	opens the bolt.


	71  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Amazed at these proceedings.


	72  VIEW ON KILGORE

	as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets
	into the sling and slams the bolt shut.


	73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

	He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
	The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him
	on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol.


	74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
	careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.
	Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent
	cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back
	into the copter.


	75  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The gaudy rifle passed by him.

				SOLDIER  (O.S.)
		That's 27, sir.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a card?

	Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and
	flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from
	Kilgore.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	76  FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C.

	Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing
	GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by
	-- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en-
	trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
	point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
	down.


	77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

	Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-
	field. He has the R.T.

	He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak
	to Lance.

				KILGORE
		The L.Z.'s cooling off fast --
		we'll move in another company
		an' then we'll own it.
			(he laughs to himself)
		Charlie's point.

	He looks out toward the ocean.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Good swell.

				LANCE
		What, sir?

				KILGORE
		I said it's a good swell -- hell
		of a good swell 'bout six feet.
		Let's get a look at it.

	Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


	78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

	The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
	and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
	over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
	green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
	at the last minute as the wave breaks.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

	Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
	regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
	DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
	southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
	over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
	Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
	doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
	out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
	are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
	P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


	80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
	stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
	SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

				SOLDIER
		Incoming !

	They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
	-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
	away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
	unmoved.

				KILGORE
		Look at that.

	They look.

				LANCE
		This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
		sir, maybe we oughta stand
		somewhere else.

	Kilgore pays him no mention.

				WILLARD
		I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
		Colonel.

				KILGORE
			(without looking)
		It'll get here, soldier.

	He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
	sand.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Change.

				MIKE
		Wh -- what?

				KILGORE
		Change -- get out there -- I
		want'a see if it's ridable --
		change.

				MIKE
		It's still pretty hairy, sir.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		You want'a surf, soldier?

	He nods yes meakly.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		That's good, boy, because it's
		either surf or fight.

	They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
	one of the guards. They all think he's going to
	shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
		all.

	He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
	Colonel walks over.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		You think that section on the
		 point is ridable, Lance?

				LANCE
		I think we ought to wait for
		the tide to come in.

	A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
	for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
	air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

				KILGORE
		Doesn't happen for six hours.

	Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
	his helmet.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The tide -- doesn't come in for
		six hours.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

	They walk through shallows carrying brightly
	colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
	overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
	carrying out wounded.

	They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
	shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
	on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
	into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


	82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
	beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

	83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

	They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
	hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
	minds.


	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

				KILGORE
		They far enough?

				LANCE
		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

				KILGORE
			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		Maybe he'll get tubed.

				WILLARD
		What?

				LANCE
		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
	
				WILLARD
		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

				KILGORE
		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		The tragedy of this war is a
		dead surfer.

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

				WILLARD
		What's that?

				LANCE
		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

				KILGORE
		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(megaphone)
		Try it again, you little bastards.


	90  BACK TO SCENE

	He turns to Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

				KILGORE
		Bring that R.T., soldier.

	He grabs it.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

				CHIEF
		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

				CLEAN
		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

				CHIEF
		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

				WILLARD
			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

				LANCE
			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

				WILLARD
		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

				KILGORE
			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

				LANCE
		What?

				KILGORE
		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

				WILLARD
		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

				KILGORE
			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The wind --

				LANCE
		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

				KILGORE
			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

				WILLARD
		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

				WILLARD
		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

				LANCE
		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

				KILGORE
			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

				WILLARD
		Are you finished surfing?

				LANCE
		Yeah... thanks.

				WILLARD
		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

				LANCE
		Nah.

				WILLARD
		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

				LANCE
		No -- no, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Which one's the Colonel's?

				LANCE
		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

				WILLARD
			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

				LANCE
		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

				CLEAN
		What'd you that for?

				WILLARD
		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

				LANCE
			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

				WILLARD
		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

				CHIEF
		Lance ---
	
				LANCE
		Yeah.

				CHIEF
		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

				WILLARD
		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

	102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

	It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

				LANCE
		You hear it again?

				WILLARD
		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

				LANCE
		You think he'd of shot us?

				WILLARD
		When?

				LANCE
		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

				WILLARD
		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

				LANCE
		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

				WILLARD
		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

				CHEF
		Can I go get those mangos now?

				CHIEF
		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

				LANCE
		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

				WILLARD
		Sure.

				LANCE
		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

				WILLARD
		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

				CLEAN
		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

				WILLARD
		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

				KILGORE (V.O.)
			(over a loudspeaker)
		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

				CLEAN
		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

				CHIEF
		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

				WILLARD
		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

				CHIEF
		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

				WILLARD
		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

				WILLARD
		Chef.

				CHEF
		Yes, sir --

				WILLARD
		Why they call you that?

				CHEF
		Call me what, sir?

				WILLARD
		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

				CHEF
		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

				WILLARD
		A sauciere --
	
				CHEF
		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing out here?

				CHEF
		Cook school -- that did it.

				WILLARD
		How?

				CHEF
		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

				WILLARD
			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

				WILLARD
			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

				CHEF
		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

				CHEF
			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

				CHEF
			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

				LANCE
		What's this tiger shit?

				WILLARD
		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

				LANCE
		You think?

				WILLARD
		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

				CLEAN
		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

				WILLARD
		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

				CHEF
		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

				CHIEF
		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

				CHEF
		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

	Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
	around, and we SEE his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		What was in the jungle? What was
		there, waiting for me?

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
		was it Kurtz? He was just a name
		to me now; I couldn't remember a
		face, a voice -- he just didn't
		add up to me. all his liberal
		bullshit about the end of savagery
		-- and the role of our culture,
		our way of life...

	Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
	there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Our way of life -- I really
		started to look forward to
		meeting Kurtz again.

	PAN TO Willard, sitting alone in the rear, reading from

	114  VIEW ON WILLARD

	 Willard opens a letter from the packet.

	We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine
	writing on the envelope.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier of A Dtachment
		contained letters from the families
		and wives of Kurtz' men There
		were letters from Kurtz' wife as
		well.


	115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

	It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner
	is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz --
	Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up
	with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year
	old American Beauty... She is classically American.

	looking at the picture -- puts it back, then opens the

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Dearest Walt -- I have to confess
		something. I know how you feel
		about this, but I had to ask Bob
		to find out what he could -- I
		just couldn't stand it anymore,
		not knowing where you are, whether
		you're alive or dead. I'm sorry
		Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob
		didn't tell me anything -- he said
		he couldn't -- I can't stand it
		anymore, Walt -- I just can't
		stand it.

	Willard looks out at the jungle.

	Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests
	pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		I have to take the kids to school
		every morning now -- carpools just
		never work out.

		Jeff came home with a black eye
		on Tuesday but said he won anyway.
		He wouldn't tell me what the fight

		it.


	117  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly
	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back
					Forget it --

	He folds up the letter.

	Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-
	copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that
	brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-
	coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.


	120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS

	Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the
	dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

				WILLARD 
		Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.?

				SOLDIER
		Stepped on a booby trap, sir --
		got blown all to hell --

				WILLARD 
		Well , who's in command here?

	He turns and walks off babbling incoherently -- 

				WILLARD 
		What about you, soldier?

	The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling
	idiotically and making animal noises. He stumbles off
	after his friend.

	Willard turns around looking for where the voice came
	from.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		Over here, Captain --

	He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a
	large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same
	clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions
	Willard into the tent.


	122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT

	They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

	On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the
	pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches
	out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play
	cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over 
	the situation.

				AGENT
		You came in on that boat, didn't
		you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah --

				AGENT
		Where are you headed?

				WILLARD 
		What's it matter? Get to the

		Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this

				WILLARD 
		Captain Willard -- go ahead.

				AGENT
		Look -- we got in a little trouble
		-- they rudely took our helicopter
		for MedEvac work on this -- uh
		Operation Brute Force -- They just
		brought it back this morning.

				WILLARD 
		Yeah.

				AGENT
		Well I mean like they also took
		our fuel -- We've been here two
		days.

				WILLARD 
		Dreadful.

				AGENT
		Look -- the girls could get
		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

				WILLARD 
		Well --

				AGENT
		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

				WILLARD 
		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

				AGENT
		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

				TERRI
		Captain --

	He turns around.

				TERRI
			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

				PILOT
		That's rich --

				TERRI
		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

				WILLARD 
		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

				AGENT
		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

				WILLARD
		I like all of them --

				AGENT
		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

				WILLARD
		I said I like all of them.

				AGENT
		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

				WILLARD
		We need all our fuel anyway.

				AGENT
		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

				WILLARD
		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

				AGENT
		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

				WILLARD
		My men --

				AGENT
		What !

				WILLARD
		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

				AGENT
		You're out of your skull --

				WILLARD
		We have a lot of pride in our

				AGENT
		How far do you think you can

		Two drums --

	Willard turns around slowly.

		Two whole drums --

	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

				WILLARD
		Why?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

				WILLARD
		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

				LIEUTENANT
		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

				WILLARD
		What is this bridge?

				LIEUTENANT
		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

				CHIEF
			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

				CHIEF
			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

				VOICE
		Straight ahead, son of a bitch.

	They dive towards the voice.


	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his
	buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

				SOLDIER
		You came right to it, son of
		a bitch --

				WILLARD
		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Where's your chief supply officer?

				SOLDIER
		Beverly Hills --

				WILLARD
		What?

				SOLDIER
		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

				WILLARD
		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

				VOICE
		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

				VOICE
			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

				LANCE
		We thought you were dead.

				VOICE
		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

				WILLARD
		What're you shooting at, soldier?

				GUNNER
		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

				GUNNER
			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

				WILLARD
		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

				GUNNER
		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

				OTHER SOLDIER
		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

				GUNNER
		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

				SPOTTER
		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

				GUNNER
		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

				ROACH
		Yeah, man.

				SPOTTER
		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

				SPOTTER
			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

				GUNNER
		Hear him?

				ROACH
		Sure , yeah.

				GUNNER
		You need a flare --
			
				ROACH
		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
	
	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

				CHEF
		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

				SOLDIER
		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

				CLEAN
		Yeah, it still runs.

				SOLDIER
		Do me a favor buddy, please.

				CLEAN
		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

				SOLDIER
		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

				CLEAN
		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

				SOLDIER
		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

				CLEAN
		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

				CLEAN
			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

				SOLDIER
		Spooky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie?

				SOLDIER
		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

				CHIEF
		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

				WILLARD
		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.


	132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

	They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
	welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
	then pull away and accelerate fast.


	133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

	The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
	distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
	artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
	bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

				CHIEF
			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

				WILLARD
			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

				CHIEF
		Who knows what's up there?

				WILLARD
		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

				CHIEF
		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

				WILLARD
		Well, get in there.

				CHIEF
		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

				WILLARD
		Get in there !

				CHIEF
		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible
		party.

				WILLARD
		Get in there now or I'll bury
		you in this river.

	It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
	do as he says.

				CHIEF
			(finally relents, 
			  turns the helm)
		You're fucking crazy. You're
		going to get us all killed.

	The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth
	of the tributary.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	136  EXT. THE TRIBUTARY - P.B.R. - RAIN

	Rain is pouring down, but the P.B.R. is slowed down to a

	Willard, Chef and Clean in the water, cutting through
	them with machetes.

				WILLARD
		What do you see?

				CHEF
		I don't know.

	He looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark
	and high -- totally impenetrable.

				WILLARD
		Keep cutting.

	They work feverishly, knowing something is wrong.

		Whatdoya think it thinks.

				WILLARD
		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
	fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
	removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- 'bout twenty meters
		starboard.

	Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef
	cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free.

				CHEF
		There in the trees !

	Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD
	of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

				CLEAN
		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

				WILLARD
		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

				CHEF
			(exhausted)
		We're through.

	He climbs aboard and collapses.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Oh, God --

				LANCE

		I ain't finished ! I ain't finished !

				WILLARD
		Bring that bow ordnance into

	He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there
	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.


	146  CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF

	He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead.
	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.


	147  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	area in the river.


	149  MED. VIEW

	The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded.
	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-
	cause they know they're too far from the banks to
	be shot at.

	They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a
	joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint
	have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces
	of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.
	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack
	by Chief. All of the men are silent.

	Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the
	shoulder.

				CHEF
		There's some bad holes, man,
		and the cracks -- water's coming
		through the cracks. Food's shot
		to hell.

				WILLARD
		How much is left?

				CHEF
		Less than half -- sure is a

	Chief has been silent by the body of Clean in a plastic
	sack.

				WILLARD

		They're not Cong.

			(over the loud-hailer)
		We're Americans.

	Another BURST, closer.

				CHEF
		Maybe you shouldn't say we're
		Americans?

	Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure
	it out.

				WILLARD
		Chef, try your French.

	Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

	We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying
	speaking French.

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains -- nous

	There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:

				FRENCHMAN
			(shouting out)
		Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
		espanole.

				CHEF
			(to himself)
		I thought it was pretty good,
		myself.

				CHIEF

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Vous pouvez approcher mais
		doucement --

				CHEF
		Take her in slow.


	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

				PHILIPPE
		Hands on the heads.

				CHIEF
		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

				CHEF
		Hey, they speak American.

				GASTON
		Who is the commanding officer?

				CHIEF
		I --

				WILLARD
		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

				GASTON
		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

				LANCE
		I'll help you with --

				PHILIPPE
		Do not move --

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

				GASTON
		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

				WILLARD
		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

				GASTON
		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

				GASTON
		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		My youngest son -- Christian --


	161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

	He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
	ammunition trailing off behind him.

				GASTON
		Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --

	A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an
	M-16.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		And my youngest daughter --

	They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
	in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
	heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

				WILLARD
		American weapons?

				GASTON
		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,
		to shower. We'll attend to your
		repairs after dinner.

				CHEF
		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

				WILLARD
		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

				GASTON
		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

				WILLARD
		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

				GASTON
		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

				CHIEF
		What about the boat?

				PHILIPPE
		My men will keep it for you --

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

				WILLARD
		Chief.
			(pause)
		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

				GASTON
		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

				WILLARD
		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

				GASTON
		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

				WILLARD
		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

				GASTON
		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

				CHEF
		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a

	167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING

	A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still
	elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
	the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
	which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
	marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.

	haggard, looking down at the album.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I wondered -- how long has this room
		been like this; how long has the
		furniture been standing in these
		places?


	169  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Some old photographs of people standing around a car
	in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture
	shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the
	plantation.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Was it like this sixty years ago?
		Eighty years? But here, even
		eighty years is nothing.

	He turns the page,

	The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing,
	skeletal against the sky and jungle.

	it was to be built.


	172  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish
	mirror. He barely recognizes himself.


	173  MED. VIEW

	Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-
	of-time room.


	174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

				CHEF
		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Hey -- Lance.

				LANCE
		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
		please.

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

				GASTON
		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

				ROXANNE
		Je vais bien maintenant.

				GASTON
		May I present Captain Willard?
		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

				ROXANNE
			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

				WILLARD
		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

				GASTON
		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

				GASTON
		Captain?

				WILLARD
		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

				GASTON
		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

				WILLARD
		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

				GASTON
		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

				WILLARD
		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

				PHILIPPE
		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

				ROXANNE
		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

				WILLARD
		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

				GASTON
		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

				WILLARD
		Do you know that jungle?

				GASTON
		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

				WILLARD
		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

				GASTON
		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

				WILLARD
		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

				ROXANNE
		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

				WILLARD
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				ROXANNE
			(rising)
		Cognac?

				WILLARD
		I should be checking on the
		boat.

				ROXANNE
		The war will still be here
		tomorrow.

	She walks out of the room.

				WILLARD
			(thinking)
		I guess so.

	He follows.


	175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

	Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

				ROXANNE
		Do you miss your home, Captain?
		Have you someone there?

				WILLARD
		No. Not really.
	
		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,
		everything I love is here.

				ROXANNE
		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

				WILLARD
		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

				ROXANNE
		What's a big question?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

				ROXANNE
		Yes.

				WILLARD
		What did you hear?

				ROXANNE
		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

				WILLARD
		What things?

				ROXANNE
		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

				WILLARD
		Yes.

				ROXANNE
		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

				WILLARD
		I know.

				ROXANNE
		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.


	176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

	A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
	ing the front of house, from the river.

				ROXANNE
			(from the sitting room)
		Are you warm, Captain?

				WILLARD
		The river is beautiful.

	In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


	177  WILLARD'S POV.

	The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
	Vietnamese.


	176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
	up behind him.

				ROXANNE
		I spend hours watching that
		river from my bedroom window.
		It fascinates me.

	She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
	kissing her.

	179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.


	180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
	for the long night.


	181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

	His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
	she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
	room, and up the stairs.


	182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

	It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
	door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
	large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
	it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
	there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
	He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
	down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
	stands there facing him.

	He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
	down on the bed and watches him.

				ROXANNE
		I have been lonely here, Captain.

	He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
	leaning against the wall in his reach.

							FADE OUT.


	183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

	We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
	slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
	kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
	night.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.


	184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

	Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
	the first disappears into the thicket.


	185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.


	186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
	into the hold.


	187  NEW VIEW

	He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
	with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
	best work alone, and at night.

							CUT TO.


	188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

				ROXANNE
		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

				WILLARD
		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

				ROXANNE
		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

				WILLARD
		So that's it.

				ROXANNE
		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

				WILLARD
		What if I say no.

				ROXANNE
		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

				GASTON
		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

				WILLARD
		Your daughter.

				CHIEF
		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

				WILLARD
		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

				WILLARD
		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

				GASTON
		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the
		jungle and sleep on it. Burn
		the forest and we'll hide in
		the swamp. all the while, we
		do but one thing -- clean the
		blood off our bayonets.
			(pause)
		Au revoir, Captain.


	190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

	Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


	191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

				CHIEF
		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.

				CLEAN
		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

				WILLARD
		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

				CHIEF
		When'd you do it?

				WILLARD
		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

				CHEF (O.S.)
		Flood.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		No -- most of 'em are still
		standing -- might've been
		disease.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		I don't know -- there'd still
		be some sign -- it's just like
		the one this morning.

	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

	197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

				CHIEF
		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

				LANCE
		The other one --

		No -- leave it --

				CHIEF
		Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

				WILLARD
		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

				WILLARD
		Yeah -- like keep out --

	Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
	past the smoking mound.


	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

				WILLARD
		Listen.

				CHIEF
		What is it?

				WILLARD
		Listen.

	They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND

		Two hours after the fog lifted,
		we moved slowly to a spot we
		thought was roughly a mile and
		a half below Kurtz's camp. We
		approached a long sand-bank
		stretching down the middle of
		the river.

				CHIEF
		Which way? Right or left?

				WILLARD

				CHIEF
		Looks pretty shallow.

	The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef

	The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in

		Somehow, in the middle of this ...

		Here they are in Los Angeles.
		Everything is safe. There's a

	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed

	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this

	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a

	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

				WILLARD
		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
	pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
	faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.


	219  VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW

	They look up toward the bank.


	220  THEIR POV

	The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built
	around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.
	Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress.


	221  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He picks up his field glasses and looks through.


	222  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES

	A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering
	strict and military:

				FOURTH SPECIAL FORCES
				MISSION F-82
				NU MUNG BA

	The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand.

				OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW !

	The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
	astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
	He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
	frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE
	OFF of him.


	223  VIEW ON WILLARD

	not believing what he's just seen.


	224  THE GLASSES POV

	Once again the young black man is now waving his
	Australian hat.


	225  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter.

				WILLARD
		We've been attacked.

				AUSTRALIAN
			(shouting back)
		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's
		all right.

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

				CHEF
		Charlie?

				WILLARD
		Looks that way.

				CHEF
			(looking at the Australian)
		Who's he?

				WILLARD
		God knows.

	The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
	board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
	tered with mud and blood.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Who the hell are you?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

				WILLARD
		Moonby what?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
		Australian Regiment, Task Force.
		Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

				WILLARD
		    (incredulously, indicating
			 the hundreds of natives)
		What is this?

				MOONBY
		Oh, they're simple enough people.
		It's good to see you, baby.
		Nobody has any Winstons?

	Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

				MOONBY
		This boat's a mess.

				WILLARD
		Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
		to him.

				MOONBY
		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
		Kurtz.
			(he puffs, then smiles)
		You listen to him. God, these
		are good. I kept these people
		off you, you know. It wasn't
		easy.

				WILLARD
		Why did they attack us?

				MOONBY
		Simple. They don't want him to
		go.

				WILLARD
		You're Australian?

				MOONBY
		Pre-Australian, actually. But
		I'd dig goin' to California.
		I'm California dreamin'.

				WILLARD
			 (almost to himself)
		So Kurtz is alive.

				MOONBY
		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

				MOONBY
			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, he is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm
		going to shoot you because you
		are a deserter.' I said I
		didn't desert from your army,
		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

				WILLARD
		Why didn't he shoot you?

				MOONBY
		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
		he talks. About everything !
		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

				CHEF
		Love?

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


	226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

	Men in small groups, huddled over food.
	Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
	are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads.


	227  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Sounds like he's gone crazy.

				MOONBY
		No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
		crazy -- if you heard him talk,
		just last week, you'd never think
		he was crazy.

				WILLARD
		Is that where he is? By the 
		shrunken heads.

				MOONBY
		Those heads, yes. Well, the
		rebels...

				WILLARD
			(to his men)
		We're going ashore. Tie her up
		-- and leave your guns up, Lance.

				LANCE
		What?

				WILLARD
		Bring your rifles, that's all.
			(looking at Moonby)
		Take us to him.

				MOONBY
		Right on -- he's been waiting
		for --

				WILLARD
		And shut up.

	Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
	and the men follow.


	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

				WILLARD
		Who are you?

				MOONBY
			(breaking in)
		His name is...

				WILLARD
		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

				MAN
		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

				WILLARD
		What happened here?

				COLBY
		What -- happened here.

				WILLARD
		Charlie?

				COLBY
		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


	229  REVERSE ON COLBY

	looks at Willard, not understanding.


	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, don´t say that.

				COLBY
		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

				WILLARD
		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

				COLBY
		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


	232  VIEW ON WILLARD

	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

				WILLARD
		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

				KURTZ
		I'm Kurtz.

				WILLARD
			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


	233  VIEW ON KURTZ

	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

				KURTZ
		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


	234  MED. VIEW

	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

				KURTZ
			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

				WILLARD
		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

				KURTZ
		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

				WILLARD
			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

				KURTZ
		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

				WILLARD
		What do you mean, Colonel?

				KURTZ
			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

				WILLARD
		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

				KURTZ
		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He remains silent.


	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

	He smiles.

				KURTZ
		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

				WILLARD
		Do you know me?

				KURTZ
		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

				KURTZ
				(continuing)
		Do you know me ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.


	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

				CHEF
		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

				WILLARD
		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

				CHEF
		What are we doing here?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

				KURTZ
		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				CHEF
		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

				WILLARD
		Not a thing.

				CHEF
		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

				WILLARD
		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

				WILLARD
		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

				CHEF
		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I know.

				CHEF
		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

				WILLARD
			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

				CHEF
		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

				WILLARD
		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


	241  WILLARD'S VIEW

	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

				MOONBY
		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

				KURTZ
		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; suddenly)
		I said get the fuck out !
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

				WILLARD
		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

				KURTZ
		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		idea ! That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Do you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I like it...

				KURTZ
		I love it.

	He rests back, grinning.

				WILLARD
		You've gone crazy.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

				CHEF
			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
	         NIGHT

	Willard examining the wound.

				KURTZ
			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

				WILLARD
		You can't have water after
		morphine.

				KURTZ
		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

				WILLARD
			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

				KURTZ
		How's yours?

				WILLARD
		I can handle it.

				KURTZ
		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

				WILLARD
		What Truth?

				KURTZ
		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

				WILLARD
		No water.

				KURTZ
		You know what you're doing?
		You are interfering with my
		plans !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

				CHEF
		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

				KURTZ
		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

				KURTZ
		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes your jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

				WILLARD
		How did we get here?

				KURTZ
		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is lie.

				WILLARD
		I think think a lie stinks.

				KURTZ
		Oh Captain, that is so true.

				WILLARD
		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

				WILLARD
		Fuck no.

				KURTZ
		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
		Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

				WILLARD
		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

				CHEF
		Captain -- kill him.

				KURTZ
		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

				CHEF
		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


	246  VIEW ON LANCE

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
	of mindless, programmed killer.

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		Hot damn !

	Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
	instant of silence, then:


	247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

	The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
	as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


	248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

	of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
	razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
	out to the enemy, poised to attack.


	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
	onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
	speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
	in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.

		Wow...

	Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t

	252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
	purple.

	We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
	teeth around his neck, his face painted.

	A hand drops a shell and it FIRES.


	255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER

	It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange
	and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
	sort of cosmic flower.


	256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

	Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a

	and flame fly and it is beautiful to see.

	Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope.

	261  FULL SHOT ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
		Mini-gun.


	262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.

				KURTZ
		Claymores, claymores.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
	extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
	but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
	chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
	blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.


	267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

	standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
	he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
	a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
	BLASTS more as they come.


	268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

	The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
	BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
	opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to

	He turns and runs back through the compound with the
	receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
	them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
	through metal.


	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
	and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
	es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
	The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
	men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.

	Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
	machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
	at his side and steps out.

				KURTZ
			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.

	The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
	of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
	It is the biggest firework show in history.

	The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
	Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
	air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
	MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


	276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

	following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

				KURTZ
		Go away -- hide yourself.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing?

				KURTZ
		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

				KURTZ
		I had immense plans.

				WILLARD
		I'm gonna get you out of here.

				KURTZ
		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

							FADE OUT.

	FADE IN.


	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

				COLBY
		Who is he?

				WILLARD
		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

				KURTZ
		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

				WILLARD
		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

				KURTZ
		Do I not?


	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

				KURTZ
		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

				WILLARD
		You had immense plans... immense plans...

				KURTZ
		Yes...

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

				KURTZ
		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

				COLBY
		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

				COLBY
			(continuing)
		How did they know?

				WILLARD
		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

				COLBY
		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.

	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.

	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

				WILLARD
		I never answered questions about

		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched

	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

				WILLARD
		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

	Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

				WILLARD
		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		And you admired him?

				WILLARD
		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

				WILLARD
		You knew him best.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

				WILLARD
		Yes, I know...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

				WILLARD
		Both of us...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

				WILLARD
		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Were you with him, when...

				WILLARD
		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		What were they?


	291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me.


	292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


	2  TITLE SEQUENCE

	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

				CHARLIE
		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

				LAWYER
		What about oil ?

				CHARLIE
		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

				ACCOUNTANT
		What's to prevent it ?

				CHARLIE
		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
	MOVE CLOSER.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		But I know how it started

	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

				CAPTAIN
		How about a drink ?

				WILLARD
		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

				CAPTAIN
		Winning the war by yourself.

				WILLARD
			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

				CAPTAIN
		Which part is that ?

				WILLARD
		My part.
			(TO THE WAITER)
		Beer, with ice and water.

	   
				CAPTAIN
		That's good gin.

				WILLARD
		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

				CAPTAIN
		Delta ?

				WILLARD
		No.

				CAPTAIN
		North ?

				WILLARD
		Yeah. Way north.

				CAPTAIN
		What unit were you with ?

				WILLARD
		None.

				CAPTAIN
		Rangers, eh?

				WILLARD
		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

				CAPTAIN
		Were you Longe Range Recon --

				WILLARD
		No -- I worked too far north for
		LRRP.

	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

				CAPTAIN
		That's quite an array of ribbons...

				WILLARD
		Let's talk about you.

				CAPTAIN
		I was an FO for the 25th.

				WILLARD
		Tracks ?

				CAPTAIN
		Yeah.

				WILLARD
		Fat. That's real fat.

				CAPTAIN
		Sometimes.

				WILLARD
		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

				CAPTAIN
		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

				WILLARD
		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

				CAPTAIN
		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

				WILLARD
		We do.

				CAPTAIN
		How long were you up there ?

				WILLARD
		A long time.

				CAPTAIN
		A year ? Waiter another beer.

				WILLARD
		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

				CIVILIAN
			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

				WILLARD
		Whose orders ?

				CAPTAIN
		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

				WILLARD
		Who are you ?

				CIVILIAN
		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

				WILLARD
		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

				COLONEL (O.S.)
		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

				COLONEL
		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		This gentleman or myself ?

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

				WILLARD
		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

				MAJOR
		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

				COLONEL
		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

				WILLARD
		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

				COLONEL
		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

				MAJOR
		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

				CIVILIAN
			(stopping him)
		Major.

				COLONEL
		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

				COLONEL
		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
	
		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


	11  MED VIEW

				COLONEL
		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

				MAJOR
		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

				COLONEL
		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

				MAJOR
		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

				WILLARD
		Who ?

				MAJOR
		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

				WILLARD
		Why me ?

				MAJOR
		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				COLONEL
		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

				VOICE (ON TAPE)
		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

				SECOND VOICE
		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

				THIRD VOICE
		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

				MAJOR
		That's Colonel Kurtz.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
			(STATIC)
		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

				WILLARD
		I only met Kurtz once.

				CIVILIAN
		Would he remember you ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				COLONEL
		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

				CIVILIAN
		You didn't like him.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

				COLONEL
		A lame ?

				WILLARD
		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

				COLONEL
		About what ?

				WILLARD
		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

				COLONEL
		But why ?

				WILLARD
		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

				COLONEL
		Well, he's killing now.

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				CIVILIAN
		What does that mean ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

				COLONEL
		It's got to be Kurtz.

				CIVILIAN
		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

				WILLARD
		Our Recon flight ?

				CIVILIAN
		Ours.

				WILLARD
		Touchy.

				CIVILIAN
		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

				WILLARD
		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

				CIVILIAN
		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

				WILLARD
		Terminate ?

				CIVILIAN
		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


	13  MED. VIEW

	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
			
				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for
		Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
		Radio Operator Second Class T.
		Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

				WILLARD
		Chief, try to keep out of where
		we're going -- Why we're goin' and
		what's gonna be the big surprise.

				CHIEF
		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

				WILLARD
		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

	The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the
	top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.


	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

	The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --
	the sea is calm again.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

				CHIEF
		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

				WILLARD
		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

				CHIEF
		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

				WILLARD
		Shot himself. What for ?

				CHIEF
		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

				WILLARD
		Arch light.

				CHEF
		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

				CHIEF
		Anybody see some smoke ?

				CLEAN
		Too far inland.

				LANCE
		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
	of the distant B-52 BOMBING.


	21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD

	studying, examining a report.


	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

	MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
		 
	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

				LANCE
		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

				LANCE
		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

				CHIEF
		Poor bastards, have a long year
		to go.

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

				SERGEANT
		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

				WILLARD
		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

				SERGEANT
		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

				WILLARD
		Right now -- I am.

				SERGEANT
		Well who the hell verifies that ?

				WILLARD
		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

				CHIEF
		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

				SERGEANT
		The show --

				WILLARD
		What show ?

				SERGEANT
		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

				WILLARD
		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

				SERGEANT
		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

				CHIEF
		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

							DISSOLVE TO :


	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


	29 FORWARD AREA

	jammed in the crowd

				CHEF
		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

				CHIEF
		What cat  ?

				CLEAN
		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

				CHIEF
		I never heard about that.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

				CHEF
		So what happened ?

				CLEAN
		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

				CHEF
		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

				CLEAN
		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

				CHIEF
		They nail him for it bad ?

				CLEAN
		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

				AGENT
		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

							CUT TO:


	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
	boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

				CHIEF
		Smoke !

				WILLARD
		Where ?

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

				WILLARD
		Black smoke ... secondary burning.

	The Chief grabs field glasses.

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- fishing village --
		helicopters over there. Hueys,
		lots of 'em.

				WILLARD
		First Air Cavalry. They're the
		ones gonna get us into the River.


	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
	trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


	37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He was not quite prepared for this.


	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

				KILGORE
		Bring me some cards.

				GUARD
		Sir ?

				KILGORE
		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

				WILLARD
			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand
		the nature of my mission.

				KILGORE
			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way
		till this is done, Captain.

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


	39  TRACKING VIEW

	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.


	40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

				KILGORE
		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

				LANCE
		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

				KILGORE
		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

				LANCE
		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

				KILGORE
		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

				LANCE
		Thank you, sir.

				KILGORE
		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.


	41 VIEW ON WILLARD

	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

				WILLARD
		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

				KILGORE
		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				KILGORE
		Where've you been riding, Lance?

				LANCE
		I haven't surfed since I got here.

				KILGORE
		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

	Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

				WILLARD
		I got bored in Saigon.

				KILGORE
		What's the furthest you been
		in?

				WILLARD
		Haiphong.

				KILGORE
		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

				WILLARD
		No. Walked.

				KILGORE
		What'd you do for supplies?

				WILLARD
			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

				KILGORE
		Can you trust them?

				WILLARD
		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

				KILGORE
		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

				WILLARD
		When did you hear?

				KILGORE
		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

				WILLARD
		Who knows.

				KILGORE
		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		Don't you agree?

				WILLARD
		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

				KILGORE
		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

				WILLARD
		Hairy ?

				KILGORE
		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

				WILLARD
		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

				KILGORE
		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

				WILLARD
		You'll find enough Cong up there.

				KILGORE
		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
		names all sound the same.

	He motions to one of his surfers.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

				MIKE
		Boss left.

				KILGORE
		What do you mean?

				MIKE
		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

				LANCE
		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

				MIKE
		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

				KILGORE
		How big it is?

				MIKE
		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

				LANCE
		Boss. What's the wind like.

				MIKE
		Light off shore -- really hollow.

				WILLARD
		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

				CHIEF
		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

				KILGORE
		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

				TOM
		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

				KILGORE
			(hard)
		What is it?

				TOM
		Well, I mean it's hairy in there
		-- it's Charlie's point.

	Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

				WILLARD
		Charlie don't surf.


	44  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN

	What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors
	churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st
	Cavalry Airmobile -- toughest unit in Vietnam.

	Kilgore's helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and
	has surfboards strapped underneath.


	45  MED. VIEW

	Kilgore strides up to the side door, dressed for battle.
	He looks out, around. He turns to his door GUNNER.

				KILGORE
		How do you feel, boy?

				GUNNER
		Like a mean motherfucker, sir.

	He turns to his R.T. man.

				KILGORE
		Let's go.


	46  FULL VIEW

	Helicopter rotors build up speed -- gas turbines
	belching fire from their jet pipes -- dust flying
	as fifty helicopters rise; ROAR OVER CAMERA and
	deploy into attack formation.

	dragonflies.


	48  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD,

	Willard looks ahead -- Kilgore sits near the door.
	Below they see the jungle whisk by and they are
	suddenly over the ocean, low and fast.


	49  MONTAGE

	CLOSE SHOTS of rocket pods -- mini-guns in bizarre
	looking mounts.

	CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the
	command helicopter, next to the fearsome weaponry.

	And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
	very few of them really scared -- they fondle their
	rifles, grenade launchers, anti-personnel grenades,
	claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers;
	M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars
	and bayonets.


	50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

	Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch
	the waves -- then he sits back relaxed.

				KILGORE
			(to Willard)
		We'll come in low out of the rising
		sun -- We'll put on the music about 
		a mile out.

				WILLARD
		Music?

				KILGORE
		Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares

		boys love it.


	51  MED. SHOT

	POV behind the PILOT and CO-PILOT -- the ocean rushes
	below.

				PILOT
		Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust --

	53  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	From the water we SEE the massive grouping of Hueys -- gun-

	55  EXT. VIET CONG FISHING VILLAGE - FULL SHOT

	A Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the
	beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind. This
	village commands a delta where ocean and river merge.

	Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being
	unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling
	about.

	Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;
	they stare out to see. Men scream orders -- women run
	from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere
	there is activity to prepare for the defense of the
	village.

	Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements.
	People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run

	We SEE rockets ROAR from pods -- MACHINE GUNS RATTLE --
	grenade launchers POUND away -- and MINI-GUNS pour
	streams of lead and tracers with the SOUND of a DIESEL
	HORN.


	60  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach
	streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground
	is alive with smoke and fire -- a hut EXPLODES. The
	leads ship banks sharply up over the trees -- men run
	below SHOOTING back.


	61  MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT

	EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the
	COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES
	frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE
	rips around. The gunner is blown away.


	62  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS
	FIRING into the village.


	63  MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER

	The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the

		Right along the doors, boy.

	The gunner FIRES leaning out --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Fine... fine... little higher.
		Through the roof; yeah, that's
		good.

	He leans back in.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Didn't anybody bring me any
		bombs, grenades, claymores or
		anything?

				LIEUTENANT
		You didn't tell me to, sir.

				KILGORE
			(grumbling)
		You shoulda known.

	Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
	SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
	is thrown down where he hangs on.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

				WILLARD
		Automatic weapons flashes along
		those trees -- probably eleven
		millimeter guns and AK-47's.

				KILGORE
		The trees, eh...

	He grabs the R.T.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke
		Six. Join me in sparaying some

	69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS

	The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast
	the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through

	them -- they scream and fall FIRING back.


	70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows
	them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of
	them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third.

				KILGORE
		Hold it, boy.

	He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
	back inside.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Take her up to 300 feet,
		Lieutenant.

	They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
	all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
	steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
	harness.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Rifle.

	A hand passes him a M-16.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; hard)
		My rifle, soldier.

	There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
	Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
	inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
	opens the bolt.


	71  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Amazed at these proceedings.


	72  VIEW ON KILGORE

	as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets
	into the sling and slams the bolt shut.


	73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

	He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
	The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him
	on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol.


	74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
	careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.
	Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent
	cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back
	into the copter.


	75  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The gaudy rifle passed by him.

				SOLDIER  (O.S.)
		That's 27, sir.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a card?

	Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and
	flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from
	Kilgore.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	76  FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C.

	Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing
	GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by
	-- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en-
	trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
	point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
	down.


	77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

	Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-
	field. He has the R.T.

	He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak
	to Lance.

				KILGORE
		The L.Z.'s cooling off fast --
		we'll move in another company
		an' then we'll own it.
			(he laughs to himself)
		Charlie's point.

	He looks out toward the ocean.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Good swell.

				LANCE
		What, sir?

				KILGORE
		I said it's a good swell -- hell
		of a good swell 'bout six feet.
		Let's get a look at it.

	Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


	78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

	The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
	and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
	over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
	green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
	at the last minute as the wave breaks.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

	Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
	regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
	DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
	southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
	over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
	Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
	doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
	out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
	are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
	P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


	80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
	stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
	SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

				SOLDIER
		Incoming !

	They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
	-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
	away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
	unmoved.

				KILGORE
		Look at that.

	They look.

				LANCE
		This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
		sir, maybe we oughta stand
		somewhere else.

	Kilgore pays him no mention.

				WILLARD
		I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
		Colonel.

				KILGORE
			(without looking)
		It'll get here, soldier.

	He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
	sand.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Change.

				MIKE
		Wh -- what?

				KILGORE
		Change -- get out there -- I
		want'a see if it's ridable --
		change.

				MIKE
		It's still pretty hairy, sir.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		You want'a surf, soldier?

	He nods yes meakly.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		That's good, boy, because it's
		either surf or fight.

	They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
	one of the guards. They all think he's going to
	shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
		all.

	He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
	Colonel walks over.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		You think that section on the
		 point is ridable, Lance?

				LANCE
		I think we ought to wait for
		the tide to come in.

	A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
	for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
	air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

				KILGORE
		Doesn't happen for six hours.

	Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
	his helmet.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The tide -- doesn't come in for
		six hours.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

	They walk through shallows carrying brightly
	colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
	overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
	carrying out wounded.

	They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
	shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
	on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
	into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


	82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
	beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

	83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

	They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
	hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
	minds.


	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

				KILGORE
		They far enough?

				LANCE
		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

				KILGORE
			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		Maybe he'll get tubed.

				WILLARD
		What?

				LANCE
		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
	
				WILLARD
		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

				KILGORE
		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		The tragedy of this war is a
		dead surfer.

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

				WILLARD
		What's that?

				LANCE
		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

				KILGORE
		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(megaphone)
		Try it again, you little bastards.


	90  BACK TO SCENE

	He turns to Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

				KILGORE
		Bring that R.T., soldier.

	He grabs it.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

				CHIEF
		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

				CLEAN
		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

				CHIEF
		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

				WILLARD
			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

				LANCE
			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

				WILLARD
		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

				KILGORE
			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

				LANCE
		What?

				KILGORE
		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

				WILLARD
		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

				KILGORE
			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The wind --

				LANCE
		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

				KILGORE
			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

				WILLARD
		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

				WILLARD
		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

				LANCE
		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

				KILGORE
			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

				WILLARD
		Are you finished surfing?

				LANCE
		Yeah... thanks.

				WILLARD
		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

				LANCE
		Nah.

				WILLARD
		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

				LANCE
		No -- no, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Which one's the Colonel's?

				LANCE
		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

				WILLARD
			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

				LANCE
		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

				CLEAN
		What'd you that for?

				WILLARD
		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

				LANCE
			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

				WILLARD
		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

				CHIEF
		Lance ---
	
				LANCE
		Yeah.

				CHIEF
		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

				WILLARD
		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

	It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

				LANCE
		You hear it again?

				WILLARD
		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

				LANCE
		You think he'd of shot us?

				WILLARD
		When?

				LANCE
		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

				WILLARD
		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

				LANCE
		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

				WILLARD
		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

				CHEF
		Can I go get those mangos now?

				CHIEF
		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

				LANCE
		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

				WILLARD
		Sure.

				LANCE
		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

				WILLARD
		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

				CLEAN
		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

				WILLARD
		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

				KILGORE (V.O.)
			(over a loudspeaker)
		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

				CLEAN
		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

				CHIEF
		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

				WILLARD
		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

				CHIEF
		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

				WILLARD
		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

				WILLARD
		Chef.

				CHEF
		Yes, sir --

				WILLARD
		Why they call you that?

				CHEF
		Call me what, sir?

				WILLARD
		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

				CHEF
		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

				WILLARD
		A sauciere --
	
				CHEF
		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing out here?

				CHEF
		Cook school -- that did it.

				WILLARD
		How?

				CHEF
		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

				WILLARD
			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

				WILLARD
			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

				CHEF
		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

				CHEF
			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

				CHEF
			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

				LANCE
		What's this tiger shit?

				WILLARD
		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

				LANCE
		You think?

				WILLARD
		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

				CLEAN
		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

				WILLARD
		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

				CHEF
		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

				CHIEF
		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

				CHEF
		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

	108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

	Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
	around, and we SEE his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		What was in the jungle? What was
		there, waiting for me?

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
		was it Kurtz? He was just a name
		to me now; I couldn't remember a
		face, a voice -- he just didn't
		add up to me. all his liberal
		bullshit about the end of savagery
		-- and the role of our culture,
		our way of life...

	Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
	there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Our way of life -- I really
		started to look forward to

		love you and I just can't stand
		it.


	117  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly
	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back
					Forget it --

	He folds up the letter.


	118  CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD

	He looks out at the ominous jungled mountains.

	119  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER OUTPOST - RAIN

	The P.B.R. pulls in towards an American outpost that is
	being used as a forward medical evacuation center.
	Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-
	copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that
	brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-
	coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.


	120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS

	Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the
	dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

				WILLARD 
		Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.?

				SOLDIER
		Stepped on a booby trap, sir --
		got blown all to hell --

				WILLARD 
		Well , who's in command here?

				SOLDIER
		I don't know -- don't have any
		idea -- I'm just the night man --

	He turns and walks off babbling incoherently -- 

				WILLARD 
		What about you, soldier?

	The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling
	idiotically and making animal noises. He stumbles off
	after his friend.


	121  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - WILLARD

	He looks around disgustedly

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(whispering)
		Captain --

	Willard turns around looking for where the voice came
	from.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		Over here, Captain --

	He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a
	large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same
	clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions
	Willard into the tent.


	122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT

	They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

	On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the
	pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches
	out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play
	cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over 
	the situation.

				AGENT
		You came in on that boat, didn't
		you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah --

				AGENT
		Where are you headed?

				WILLARD 
		What's it matter? Get to the 
		point.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know the girls --
		Thta's Terri -- she was playmate
		of --

				WILLARD 
		Yeah, I caught your show at Hau
		Fat.

	They all look over.

				AGENT
		Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this
		is Captain -- eh --

				WILLARD 
		Captain Willard -- go ahead.

				AGENT
		Look -- we got in a little trouble
		-- they rudely took our helicopter
		for MedEvac work on this -- uh
		Operation Brute Force -- They just
		brought it back this morning.

				WILLARD 
		Yeah.

				AGENT
		Well I mean like they also took
		our fuel -- We've been here two
		days.

				WILLARD 
		Dreadful.

				AGENT
		Look -- the girls could get
		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

				WILLARD 
		Well --

				AGENT
		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

				WILLARD 
		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

				AGENT
		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

				TERRI
		Captain --

	He turns around.

				TERRI
			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

				PILOT
		That's rich --

				TERRI
		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

				WILLARD 
		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

				AGENT
		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

				WILLARD
		I like all of them --

				AGENT
		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

				WILLARD
		I said I like all of them.

				AGENT
		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

				WILLARD
		We need all our fuel anyway.

				AGENT
		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

				WILLARD
		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

				AGENT
		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

				WILLARD
		My men --

				AGENT
		What !

				WILLARD
		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

				AGENT
		You're out of your skull --

				WILLARD
		We have a lot of pride in our
		unit --

				AGENT
		How far do you think you can
		push -- what kind of people do
		you think --

				WILLARD
		Esprit de corps --
	
				AGENT
		No -- absolutely not --

				WILLARD
		One for all -- all for one --

				AGENT
		You can keep your fucking fuel --

	Willard gets up.

				WILLARD
		You make some of your closest
		friends in the army -- war has a
		way of bringing men together.

				AGENT
		Get out --

				WILLARD
		Men of all races -- nationalities --

	He gets up and starts out.

				AGENT
		Two drums --

	Willard turns around slowly.

				AGENT
			(continuing)
		Two whole drums --

				WILLARD
		We can use some fifty caliber and
		a 16 too --

				AGENT
		I don't know what you're talking
		about -- Get fucked --

				WILLARD
		I will -- I assure you that --
		You got a fifty on that H-34 --
		leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll
		get my men to bring the first drum
		with 'em --

	He turns to go under the tent flap.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Have the girls freshen up a bit --
		comb their hair -- put on
		something -- you know what I mean --

	He leaves.


	123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning
	it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16.

				CLEAN
		You keep this thing in this
		condition an' it's gonna jam,
		Lance -- mark my words.

				LANCE
		Why don't you go pet the water
		buffaloes -- get off my back.

	Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes
	eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle
	brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their
	sides the words have been stenciled in black:
			
				1 Each --
				Buffalo, Water B-1A
				U.S. Army No. 15239

	Willard walks through them down to the boat.

				CHIEF
		Careful,  Captain, they've been
		known to charge.

				WILLARD
		All right I got a little surprise
		for you --

	They all look up.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've arranged with those people
		we saw at Hau Fat to give us some
		50 caliber in trade for a couple
		a drums of fuel --

				CHEF
		No shit.

				WILLARD
		Chef -- since you're such a fan
		of Miss December's I think you
		should be detailed with Lance and
		Clean to take the first drum up
		there.

				CHEF
		I don't believe you --

				CHIEF
		What're you trying to say, Captain --

				WILLARD
		You'll see soon enough -- get going,
		sailor --

				CHIEF
		No shit -- hot damn --


	124  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - LYNDA, CHEF

	He has followed her into the tent awe-struck -- she
	casuallu starts unbuttoning her fatigue jacket and taking
	off her pants. he just stands there, his arms at his
	sides.

				CHEF
		I've got every one of your

				LYNDA
		Well, get undressed and let's

	She lies down on the cot in only her panties.

				CHEF

		You wouldn't mind -- uh kinda
		draping that jacket over you
		sort of the way you were in the

	They have just finished making love. cathy looks very
	pleased. Lance finishes tying his boots -- she draws on
	his back. He gets up -- starts to leave.

				LANCE
		Well -- uh thanks -- see you around.

				CATHY
		Yeah.

	He leaves -- she pulls herself up and starts combing her
	hair -- Mr. Clean walks in.

				CATHY

	his gun belt and picks up his M-16. She looks up at him --

				WILLARD
		Ma'am -- I'd like to thank you for
		what you an' all your friends have
		done for us -- I want you to know
		that me an' the men appreciate
		you coming all this way -- riskin'
		your lives -- living uncomfortably
		an' doing all you can to entertain
		us. I want you to know personally,
		Miss, that for the past few minutes
		you have made me feel at home.

	She picks up a shoe to throw at him. he turns, exits f.g.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Just wanted to say that, ma'am.

	The SHOE CLANGS off his helmet.

							CUT TO:


	127  EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT -
	         NIGHT

	The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
	distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
	with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
	burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
	light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
	night.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days and nights later, we
		approach the Do Lung Bridge.


	128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

				SOLDIER
		I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
		-- I got money.

				CHIEF
		Get away from this boat.

				WILLARD
		Who's your C.O., soldier?

	The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

				SOLDIER
		Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
		to you.

	Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
	forward.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard?

				WILLARD
		That's me.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard -- we got these
		from Nha Thrang two days ago --
		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

				WILLARD
		Why?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

				WILLARD
		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

				LIEUTENANT
		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

				WILLARD
		What is this bridge?

				LIEUTENANT
		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

				CHIEF
			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

				CHIEF
			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

				VOICE
		Straight ahead, son of a bitch.

	They dive towards the voice.


	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his
	buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

				SOLDIER
		You came right to it, son of
		a bitch --

				WILLARD
		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Where's your chief supply officer?

				SOLDIER
		Beverly Hills --

				WILLARD
		What?

				SOLDIER
		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

				WILLARD
		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

				VOICE
		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

				VOICE
			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

				LANCE
		We thought you were dead.

				VOICE
		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

				WILLARD
		What're you shooting at, soldier?

				GUNNER
		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

				GUNNER
			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

				WILLARD
		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

				GUNNER
		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

				OTHER SOLDIER
		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

				GUNNER
		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

				SPOTTER
		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

				GUNNER
		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

				ROACH
		Yeah, man.

				SPOTTER
		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

				SPOTTER
			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

				GUNNER
		Hear him?

				ROACH
		Sure , yeah.

				GUNNER
		You need a flare --
			
				ROACH
		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
	
	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

				CHEF
		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

				SOLDIER
		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

				CLEAN
		Yeah, it still runs.

				SOLDIER
		Do me a favor buddy, please.

				CLEAN
		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

				SOLDIER
		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

				CLEAN
		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

				SOLDIER
		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

				CLEAN
		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

				CLEAN
			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

				SOLDIER
		Spooky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie?

				SOLDIER
		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

				CHIEF
		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

				WILLARD
		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.


	132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

	They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
	welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
	then pull away and accelerate fast.


	133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

	The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
	distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
	artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
	bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

				CHIEF
			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

				WILLARD
			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

				CHIEF
		Who knows what's up there?

				WILLARD
		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

				CHIEF
		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

				WILLARD
		Well, get in there.

				CHIEF
		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

				WILLARD
		Get in there !

				CHIEF
		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible
		party.

				WILLARD
		Get in there now or I'll bury
		you in this river.

	It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
	do as he says.

				CHIEF
			(finally relents, 
			  turns the helm)
		You're fucking crazy. You're
		going to get us all killed.

		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck

	Lance grits his teeth, FIRING --


	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

				CLEAN
		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

				WILLARD
		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

				CHEF
			(exhausted)
		We're through.

	He climbs aboard and collapses.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Oh, God --

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		I ain't finished ! I ain't finished !

				WILLARD
		Bring that bow ordnance into 
		those trees.

	He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there
	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.


	146  CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF

	He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead.
	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.


	147  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The boat slams through the hyacinth growth, moving through
	the river, FIRING BACK at unseen enemy in the jungle.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	148  FULL VIEW ON THE P.B.R. - TWILIGHT

	The boat moves ahead at half speed through a wide, flat
	area in the river.


	149  MED. VIEW

	The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded.
	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-
	cause they know they're too far from the banks to
	be shot at.

	They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a
	joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint
	have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces
	of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.
	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack
	by Chief. All of the men are silent.

	Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the
	shoulder.

				CHEF
		There's some bad holes, man,
		and the cracks -- water's coming
		through the cracks. Food's shot
		to hell.

				WILLARD
		How much is left?

				CHEF
		Less than half -- sure is a
		mess down there.

	Chief has been silent by the body of Clean in a plastic
	sack.

				WILLARD
		And the grass?

				CHEF
		Still got a lot of that stuff
		from Nha Trang. But we're
		running low on the other.

	Chief pushes Clean's body into the river.


	150  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He notices something in the distance.


	151  WILLARD'S POV

	A light.


	152  MED. VIEW

	Willard stands up, pointing up the river.

				WILLARD
		Hey.

	They all look over.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		That's a light down there --

				CHEF
		Yeah, it is.

				CHIEF
		What the hell is it?

				WILLARD
		In the middle of the jungle --
		a goddamn light.


	153  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. - THE TWILIGHT

	The P.B.R. approaches the distant light -- which seems
	to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building.


	154  VIEW ON WILLARD, CHIEF

	straining to see; he uses field glasses.


	155  POV - THROUGH THE GLASSES

	Seems to be some figures standing on the dock. The
	figures pull back behind some drums.


	156  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Watch it !

	They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the
	water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns
	trained on the dock as the boat still approaches.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		They're not Cong.

				CHIEF
			(over the loud-hailer)
		We're Americans.

	Another BURST, closer.

				CHEF
		Maybe you shouldn't say we're
		Americans?

	Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure
	it out.

				WILLARD
		Chef, try your French.

	Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains --

	Silence.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.


	157  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks through the glasses.


	158  POV THROUGH THE GLASSES

	Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums
	on the dock.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		French Nationals -- they may not
		be too friendly, though.


	159  BACK TO SCENE

	We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying
	speaking French.

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains -- nous
		sommes des amis --

	There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:

				FRENCHMAN
			(shouting out)
		Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
		espanole.

				CHEF
			(to himself)
		I thought it was pretty good,
		myself.

				CHIEF
		What'd he say?

				CHEF
		Said I speak French like a
		Spanish cow.

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Laisser tomber vos armes --

				CHEF
		Put the guns straight up -- stand
		away from the mounts.

				WILLARD
		Do it.

	They do.

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Vous pouvez approcher mais
		doucement --

				CHEF
		Take her in slow.


	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

				PHILIPPE
		Hands on the heads.

				CHIEF
		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

				CHEF
		Hey, they speak American.

				GASTON
		Who is the commanding officer?

				CHIEF
		I --

				WILLARD
		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

				GASTON
		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

				LANCE
		I'll help you with --

				PHILIPPE
		Do not move --

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

				GASTON
		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

				WILLARD
		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

				GASTON
		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

				GASTON
		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		My youngest son -- Christian --


	161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

	He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
	ammunition trailing off behind him.

				GASTON
		Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --

	A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an
	M-16.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		And my youngest daughter --
		Claudine.


	162  CLOSE ON CLAUDINE

	an attractive girl about eighteen. She wears a red
	paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit. She carries
	an M-79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition.


	163  FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS

	They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
	in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
	heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

				WILLARD
		American weapons?

				GASTON
		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,
		to shower. We'll attend to your
		repairs after dinner.

				CHEF
		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

				WILLARD
		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

				GASTON
		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

				WILLARD
		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

				GASTON
		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

				CHIEF
		What about the boat?

				PHILIPPE
		My men will keep it for you --

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

				WILLARD
		Chief.
			(pause)
		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

				GASTON
		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

				WILLARD
		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

				GASTON
		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

				WILLARD
		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

				GASTON
		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

				CHEF
		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
	shower is.


	166  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING

	battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese
	guard at the boat.


	167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING

	A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still
	elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
	the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
	which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
	marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.


	168  VIEW ON WILLARD

	haggard, looking down at the album.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I wondered -- how long has this room
		been like this; how long has the
		furniture been standing in these
		places?


	169  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Some old photographs of people standing around a car
	in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture
	shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the
	plantation.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Was it like this sixty years ago?
		Eighty years? But here, even
		eighty years is nothing.

	He turns the page,

	The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing,
	skeletal against the sky and jungle.


	170  VIEW ON WILLARD

	fascinated

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was jungle, once; and it will
		be jungle, again...


	171  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Onlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc-
	tures. Then another picture of the jungle site where
	it was to be built.


	172  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish
	mirror. He barely recognizes himself.


	173  MED. VIEW

	Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-
	of-time room.


	174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

				CHEF
		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Hey -- Lance.

				LANCE
		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
		please.

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

				GASTON
		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

				ROXANNE
		Je vais bien maintenant.

				GASTON
		May I present Captain Willard?
		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

				ROXANNE
			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

				WILLARD
		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

				GASTON
		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

				GASTON
		Captain?

				WILLARD
		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

				GASTON
		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

				WILLARD
		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

				GASTON
		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

				WILLARD
		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

				PHILIPPE
		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

				ROXANNE
		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

				WILLARD
		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

				GASTON
		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

				WILLARD
		Do you know that jungle?

				GASTON
		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

				WILLARD
		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

				GASTON
		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

				WILLARD
		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

				ROXANNE
		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

				WILLARD
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				ROXANNE
			(rising)
		Cognac?

				WILLARD
		I should be checking on the
		boat.

				ROXANNE
		The war will still be here
		tomorrow.

	She walks out of the room.

				WILLARD
			(thinking)
		I guess so.

	He follows.


	175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

	Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

				ROXANNE
		Do you miss your home, Captain?
		Have you someone there?

				WILLARD
		No. Not really.
	
		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,
		everything I love is here.

				ROXANNE
		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

				WILLARD
		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

				ROXANNE
		What's a big question?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

				ROXANNE
		Yes.

				WILLARD
		What did you hear?

				ROXANNE
		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

				WILLARD
		What things?

				ROXANNE
		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

				WILLARD
		Yes.

				ROXANNE
		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

				WILLARD
		I know.

				ROXANNE
		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.


	176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

	A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
	ing the front of house, from the river.

				ROXANNE
			(from the sitting room)
		Are you warm, Captain?

				WILLARD
		The river is beautiful.

	In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


	177  WILLARD'S POV.

	The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
	Vietnamese.


	176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
	up behind him.

				ROXANNE
		I spend hours watching that
		river from my bedroom window.
		It fascinates me.

	She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
	kissing her.

	179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.


	180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
	for the long night.


	181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

	His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
	she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
	room, and up the stairs.


	182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

	It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
	door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
	large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
	it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
	there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
	He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
	down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
	stands there facing him.

	He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
	down on the bed and watches him.

				ROXANNE
		I have been lonely here, Captain.

	He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
	leaning against the wall in his reach.

							FADE OUT.


	183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

	We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
	slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
	kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
	night.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.


	184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

	Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
	the first disappears into the thicket.


	185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.


	186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
	into the hold.


	187  NEW VIEW

	He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
	with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
	best work alone, and at night.

							CUT TO.


	188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

				ROXANNE
		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

				WILLARD
		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

				ROXANNE
		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

				WILLARD
		So that's it.

				ROXANNE
		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

				WILLARD
		What if I say no.

				ROXANNE
		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

				GASTON
		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

				WILLARD
		Your daughter.

				CHIEF
		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

				WILLARD
		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

				WILLARD
		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

				GASTON
		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the
		jungle and sleep on it. Burn
		the forest and we'll hide in
		the swamp. all the while, we
		do but one thing -- clean the
		blood off our bayonets.
			(pause)
		Au revoir, Captain.


	190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

	Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


	191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

				CHIEF
		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.

				CLEAN
		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

				WILLARD
		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

				CHIEF
		When'd you do it?

				WILLARD
		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

				CHEF (O.S.)
		Flood.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		No -- most of 'em are still
		standing -- might've been
		disease.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		I don't know -- there'd still
		be some sign -- it's just like
		the one this morning.

	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

	197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

				CHIEF
		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

				LANCE
		The other one --

				WILLARD
		No -- leave it --

				CHIEF
		Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

				WILLARD
		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

				WILLARD
		Whoever put'em there didn't do it
		to kill people -- They put 'em up
		as signs -- 

				CHIEF
		Signs?

				WILLARD
		Yeah -- like keep out --

	Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
	past the smoking mound.


	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.


	199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

				WILLARD
		Listen.

				CHIEF
		What is it?

				WILLARD
		Listen.

	They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND
	COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of
	HUNDREDS OF MEN.

				CHIEF
		They're on the banks of the
		river.

	Frantically, he swings the twin fifties around.

	We can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog.

				CHIEF
		No, Lance. Not while you can't 
		see.


	202  VIEW ON WILLARD

	listening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING.

				CHIEF
		Will they attack?

				WILLARD
		If they have boats ... or

		the fog. We can't move either --
		we'll end up on the shore.

				CHEF
		God...

				LANCE
		Sounds like hundreds of them.

				WILLARD
		Shhhhhh.

	The CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile
	cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN
	ANGUISH.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		It doesn't sound hostile --
		it sounds like they've seen us
		coming and it sounds like --
		I don't know, a funeral. I
		don't understand.


	203  VIEW ON LANCE

	A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses,
	fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R.

	204  MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R.

	MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds
	cautiously.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two hours after the fog lifted,
		we moved slowly to a spot we
		thought was roughly a mile and
		a half below Kurtz's camp. We
		approached a long sand-bank
		stretching down the middle of
		the river.

				CHIEF
		Which way? Right or left?

				WILLARD
		Who knows? Right.

				CHIEF
		Looks pretty shallow.

	The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef
	takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.


	205  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from
	bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard
	takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung.
	Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him.

				WILLARD

		Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --

			(pause)
		Purgative air strike ! Purgative !
		They'd kill me too !

	Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds
	and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.
	rattling against the boat.

				CHIEF
		Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
		shooting fucking arrows at us.


	206  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	looking toward the banks.


	207  WILLARD'S POV

	Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes
	entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of
	pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them.


	208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the
	childish assault.

				WILLARD
		Steer her right.

	arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything
	they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.
	
				WILLARD
		Keep going.. keep going.
		They're just fucking sticks !
		Chief, stay at the helm.

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
	horror.


	210  VIEW ON CHIEF

	laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,
	bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard,
	about to say something.

				CHIEF
		A spear?

	He dies.


	211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle
	long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

				WILLARD
		Stop it. Stop it !

	Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are
	absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down
	and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

				LANCE
		Chief's dead.

	Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot
	in his hand.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was the strangest thing --
		I don't know that I can explain
		it. Two of my men dead, and all
		I could think of was whether
		Kurtz was dead too. That's all
		I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
		Kurtz.

	He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Somehow, in the middle of this ...
		carnival, Kurtz had grown into
		something -- a gifted officer;
		a great man.
		Somehow, he was the only light
		in this hopeless, hopeless
		darkness.
		And now I was too late --
		he was probably gone, disappeared...
		by a grenade rolled into his

		Christ, I felt like howling like

	212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

	The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.
	Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing
	to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on
	the edge of the party.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Here they are in Los Angeles.
		Everything is safe. There's a
		supermarket around the corner,
		the police station around the
		other. It would seem ridiculous
		to them that I was shot to hell
		because I had lost the privilege
		of listening to the mysterious
		Colonel Kurtz.

	213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

	The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
	in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


	214  WHAT THEY SEE

	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
	of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
	about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
	the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
	white and blue.


	215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

				WILLARD
		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
	pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
	faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.


	219  VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW

	They look up toward the bank.


	220  THEIR POV

	The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built
	around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.
	Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress.

	He picks up his field glasses and looks through.


	222  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES

	A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering
	strict and military:

				FOURTH SPECIAL FORCES
				MISSION F-82
				NU MUNG BA

	The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand.

				OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW !

	The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
	astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
	He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
	frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE
	OFF of him.


	223  VIEW ON WILLARD

	not believing what he's just seen.


	224  THE GLASSES POV

	Once again the young black man is now waving his
	Australian hat.


	225  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter.

				WILLARD
		We've been attacked.

				AUSTRALIAN
			(shouting back)
		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's
		all right.

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

				CHEF
		Charlie?

				WILLARD
		Looks that way.

				CHEF
			(looking at the Australian)
		Who's he?

				WILLARD
		God knows.

	The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
	board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
	tered with mud and blood.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Who the hell are you?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

				WILLARD
		Moonby what?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
		Australian Regiment, Task Force.
		Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

				WILLARD
		    (incredulously, indicating
			 the hundreds of natives)
		What is this?

				MOONBY
		Oh, they're simple enough people.
		It's good to see you, baby.
		Nobody has any Winstons?

	Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

				MOONBY
		This boat's a mess.

				WILLARD
		Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
		to him.

				MOONBY
		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
		Kurtz.
			(he puffs, then smiles)
		You listen to him. God, these
		are good. I kept these people
		off you, you know. It wasn't
		easy.

				WILLARD
		Why did they attack us?

				MOONBY
		Simple. They don't want him to
		go.

				WILLARD
		You're Australian?

				MOONBY
		Pre-Australian, actually. But
		I'd dig goin' to California.
		I'm California dreamin'.

				WILLARD
			 (almost to himself)
		So Kurtz is alive.

				MOONBY
		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

				MOONBY
			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, he is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm
		going to shoot you because you
		are a deserter.' I said I
		didn't desert from your army,
		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

				WILLARD
		Why didn't he shoot you?

				MOONBY
		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
		he talks. About everything !
		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

				CHEF
		Love?

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


	226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

	Men in small groups, huddled over food.
	Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
	are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads.


	227  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Sounds like he's gone crazy.

				MOONBY
		No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
		crazy -- if you heard him talk,
		just last week, you'd never think
		he was crazy.

				WILLARD
		Is that where he is? By the 
		shrunken heads.

				MOONBY
		Those heads, yes. Well, the
		rebels...

				WILLARD
			(to his men)
		We're going ashore. Tie her up
		-- and leave your guns up, Lance.

				LANCE
		What?

				WILLARD
		Bring your rifles, that's all.
			(looking at Moonby)
		Take us to him.

				MOONBY
		Right on -- he's been waiting
		for --

				WILLARD
		And shut up.

	Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
	and the men follow.


	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

				WILLARD
		Who are you?

				MOONBY
			(breaking in)
		His name is...

				WILLARD
		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

				MAN
		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

				WILLARD
		What happened here?

				COLBY
		What -- happened here.

				WILLARD
		Charlie?

				COLBY
		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


	229  REVERSE ON COLBY

	looks at Willard, not understanding.


	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, don´t say that.

				COLBY
		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

				WILLARD
		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

				COLBY
		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


	232  VIEW ON WILLARD

	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

				WILLARD
		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

				KURTZ
		I'm Kurtz.

				WILLARD
			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


	233  VIEW ON KURTZ

	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

				KURTZ
		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


	234  MED. VIEW

	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

				KURTZ
			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

				WILLARD
		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

				KURTZ
		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

				WILLARD
			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

				KURTZ
		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

				WILLARD
		What do you mean, Colonel?

				KURTZ
			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

				WILLARD
		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

				KURTZ
		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He remains silent.


	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

	He smiles.

				KURTZ
		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

				WILLARD
		Do you know me?

				KURTZ
		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

				KURTZ
				(continuing)
		Do you know me ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.


	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

				CHEF
		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

				WILLARD
		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

				CHEF
		What are we doing here?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

				KURTZ
		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				CHEF
		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

				WILLARD
		Not a thing.

				CHEF
		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

				WILLARD
		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

				WILLARD
		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

				CHEF
		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I know.

				CHEF
		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

				WILLARD
			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

				CHEF
		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

				WILLARD
		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


	241  WILLARD'S VIEW

	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

				MOONBY
		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

				KURTZ
		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; suddenly)
		I said get the fuck out !
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

				WILLARD
		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

				KURTZ
		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		idea ! That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Do you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I like it...

				KURTZ
		I love it.

	He rests back, grinning.

				WILLARD
		You've gone crazy.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

				CHEF
			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
	         NIGHT

	Willard examining the wound.

				KURTZ
			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

				WILLARD
		You can't have water after
		morphine.

				KURTZ
		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

				WILLARD
			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

				KURTZ
		How's yours?

				WILLARD
		I can handle it.

				KURTZ
		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

				WILLARD
		What Truth?

				KURTZ
		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

				WILLARD
		No water.

				KURTZ
		You know what you're doing?
		You are interfering with my
		plans !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

				CHEF
		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

				KURTZ
		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

				KURTZ
		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes your jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

				WILLARD
		How did we get here?

				KURTZ
		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is lie.

				WILLARD
		I think think a lie stinks.

				KURTZ
		Oh Captain, that is so true.

				WILLARD
		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

				WILLARD
		Fuck no.

				KURTZ
		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
		Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

				WILLARD
		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

				CHEF
		Captain -- kill him.

				KURTZ
		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

				CHEF
		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


	246  VIEW ON LANCE

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
	of mindless, programmed killer.

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		Hot damn !

	Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
	instant of silence, then:


	247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

	The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
	as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


	248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

	of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
	razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
	out to the enemy, poised to attack.


	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
	onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
	speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
	in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.


	250  EIS VIEW

	A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-
	delic hallucination.

	251  VIEW ON THE SOLDIER

				SOLDIER
		Wow...

	Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t
	himself.


	252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
	purple.

	We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
	teeth around his neck, his face painted.


	253  FULL VIEW - MONTAGE

	Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress.


	254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR

	A hand drops a shell and it FIRES.


	255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER

	It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange
	and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
	sort of cosmic flower.


	256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

	Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a
	death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy.


	257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS

	blasting out music.


	258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS

	With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to
	radios in their cars.


	259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS

	(In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the
	walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting
	up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock
	and flame fly and it is beautiful to see.

	Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope.


	260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV

	Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach-
	ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them.


	261  FULL SHOT ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
		Mini-gun.


	262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.


	263  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Exhilarated, and moving with the MUSIC.

				WILLARD
		Napalm.

	Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il-
	luminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm EXPLODES
	beautiful, like a magnificent firework.


	264  VIEW ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Claymores, claymores.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
	extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
	but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
	chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
	blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.


	267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

	standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
	he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
	a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
	BLASTS more as they come.


	268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

	The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
	BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
	opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to
	the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

	Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.
	He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls
	under the enemy's feet.


	269  VIEW ON MOONBY

	sees this and scampers off into the jungle, muttering
	madly to himself.


	270  MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T.

	shouting into the radio

				WILLARD
		Code -- Street Gang -- Street
		Gang ! Purgative air strike;
		Street Gang !

	He turns and runs back through the compound with the
	receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
	them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
	through metal.


	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
	and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
	es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
	The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
	men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.


	272  VIEW ON WILLARD

	watching this spectacle.


	273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

	He rounds  the shadow wall.

	Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
	machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
	at his side and steps out.

				KURTZ
			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.


	274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

	taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the
	wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett
	at the Alamo.


	275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

	The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
	of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
	It is the biggest firework show in history.

	The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
	Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
	air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
	MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


	276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

	following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

				KURTZ
		Go away -- hide yourself.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing?

				KURTZ
		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

				KURTZ
		I had immense plans.

				WILLARD
		I'm gonna get you out of here.

				KURTZ
		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

							FADE OUT.

	FADE IN.


	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

				COLBY
		Who is he?

				WILLARD
		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

							CUT TO:


	280  THE P.B.R.

	battered, moving slowly down the river.


	281  TIGHTER VIEW

	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

				KURTZ
		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

				WILLARD
		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

				KURTZ
		Do I not?


	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

				KURTZ
		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

				WILLARD
		You had immense plans... immense plans...

				KURTZ
		Yes...

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

				KURTZ
		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

				COLBY
		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

				COLBY
			(continuing)
		How did they know?

				WILLARD
		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

				COLBY
		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.


	283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	He stares up at the sky.

				WILLARD
					(to himself)
		They're coming to take us back.

	Copters directly overhead.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Yeah.

				COLBY
		Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
	proaching rescue helicopter.


	284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.


	285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
	the retreating American helicopters.


	286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

	The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into
	the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		... Don't remember a lot about my
		rehabilitation... but I was sent
		back to the world before the fall
		of Saigon...


	287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

				WILLARD
		I never answered questions about
		Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched
		the fall of Saigon on television
		in a bar in Alameda...


	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

				WILLARD
		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

				WILLARD
		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		And you admired him?

				WILLARD
		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

				WILLARD
		You knew him best.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

				WILLARD
		Yes, I know...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

				WILLARD
		Both of us...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

				WILLARD
		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Were you with him, when...

				WILLARD
		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		What were they?

     FADE IN:

     Through the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of
     small, middle-class houses.  This could be any suburban street
     in America.


     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus.  This is TODD
     BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come.  He stares out at the
     other passengers indifferently.  Then something catches his eye.


     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY

     TITLE: SANTO DONATO, CA  FEBRUARY 1984

     Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an
     unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot.  This is the kind
     of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful
     suburban community of Santo Donato.  Todd gets off his bike and
     heads up the front steps.  On the way, he bends down to pick up
     the L.A. Times.

     Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the
     door bell.  The first reads: "ARTHUR DENKER".  The second reads:
     "NO SOLICITORS, NO PEDDLERS, NO SALESMEN".

     Todd RINGS the bell.  Nothing.  He looks at his watch.  It is
     twelve past ten.  He RINGS again, this time longer.  Still
     nothing.  Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his
     watch as he does so.  After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING,
     a voice is heard from within.

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it
             go!

     Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle.
     Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT
     DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there
     in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth,
     he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein.
     Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly
     cannot.

                          DUSSANDER
                    (continuing)
             A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't
             you read?  I thought all American boys could
             read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day.

     The door begins to close.  Todd waits till the last moment 
     before speaking.

                          TODD 
             Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander. 

     The door stops.  Dussander opens it slowly.  He unlatches the
     screen and slips his fingers around the paper.  Todd does not
     let go.

                          DUSSANDER
             Give me my newspaper. 

                          TODD 
             Sure thing, Mr. Dussander. 

     Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door.
     Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the
     area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's
     bicycle.

                          DUSSANDER 
             My name is Denker.  See?
                    (pointing)
             Denker.  Perhaps you cannot read after all. 
             What a pity.  Good day. 

     As the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.

                          TODD 
             Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. 
             Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44.  Then you
             went to Patin. 

     The door stops, still partly open. 

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires.
             From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and 
             then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know.  No
             one does.  But in 1965, you popped up in West
             Berlin, where they almost got you. 

     The door opens wider. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Listen, boy.  I don't know what is the matter 
             with you.  But I don't have time for this 
             game.  Now, get out of here before I call the
             police. 

                          TODD 
             Call them if you want. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Fine. 

     The heavy door slams shut. 

                          TODD 
             It's okay by me Herr Kommandant.  I'm sure
             the police would love to meet the "Blood-
             fiend of Patin." 

     In a flash the front door is open, so is the screen.  Dussander
     is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled
     umbrella raised to strike him.  Todd stumbles back against the
     porch rail. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You get away from this house, God damn you! 
             I'll beat you all the way home.

     But Todd regains his composure quickly.  He brushes himself off
     and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the
     threat he was a few seconds ago. 

                          TODD 
             After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I
             did.  Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If
             you want to call the cops, go right ahead.
             I'II wait on the steps. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You'll do no such thing. 

                          TODD 
             I won't?  Listen, old man, if I want to start
             screaming right here, I will.  If I want to 
             ride down to the police station and bring the
             cops back myself, then I will.  I will do
             what ever I want.  Do you understand?
                    (pause) 
             But if you like, I could come in for a
             minute.  We could talk. 

     Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER
             I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy
             like you into my home.

     Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Is that what you want, to come into my home?
             So be it.  There is no arguing with crazy
             people.

     Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door.  He
     stops at the threshold of the house and turns.  He is holding
     the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the
     other.  He looks straight ahead.  A moment later, Todd steps
     into the house. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old
     man.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary.  Todd looks
     around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil
     painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle.  But he
     doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of
     a woman sits framed on an end table.

                          DUSSANDER 
             My wife.  She died in 1955 of lung disease.
             At that time I was working at the Menschler
             Motor Works in Essen.  I was heartbroken. 

     Todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a
     lampshade next to the photograph.  He begins to feel it as
     though he were inspecting it for something. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Stop that! 

     Todd jumps back a little but then recovers. 

                          TODD 
             Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the
             lampshades out of human skin?

                          DUSSANDER 
             Now I don't know what you're talking about. 

                          TODD 
             Sure you do, Mr. Dussander. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Denker.  Denker.  Denker.  You don't listen,
             boy.  The television has fried your brain. 

     Pause. 

                          TODD 
             Your hands are shaking. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, they're shaking.  I'm old.  We all 
             shake.  You are most tiresome, and rude.  Now
             if you have a point I wish you'd come to it. 

                          TODD 
             We're in no rush.  If I thought you had 
             plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know
             you don't... 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You know nothing of my business -- 

                          TODD 
             What business?  You sit in that ugly chair
             and watch soap operas all day.  Except on 
             Friday afternoons when you walk down to the 
             movie theater.  And twice a week you take the
             bus downtown to do your shopping.  You always
             use the express lane because you never have 
             more than ten items.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You have been following me?

                          TODD 
             Of course, I followed you.  You think I 
             normally go around to peoples' houses and
             accuse them of being Nazi fugitives? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Perhaps for me you made an exception. 

                          TODD 
             No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt
             Dussander I had to be absolutely certain.
             ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here. 

     Todd sits on the sofa. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oh, yes, I see now.  As I am this ex-Nazi
             fellow, as you say, then this must be the
             part where I offer you my hidden stash of
             gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish 
             men, of course, which I keep buried in the 
             basement.  Isn't that right, boy?  Well, I'm
             afraid you're wasting your time. I have no 
             money.  If I did I might even give you some
             just to be done with this nonsense. 

                          TODD 
             I don't need money.  You don't have any 
             anyway.  At least, I don't think so.  You
             probably had to spend it all to sneak in the
             country.  A good American passport is 
             expensive on the black market, that I know. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Do you?  Good for you. 

                          TODD 
             Yes, I do.  I know it all, Dussander.  You're
             my One Great Interest. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Your what? 

                          TODD 
             My One Great Interest.  Well, not you 
             personally, but, ...well, it's something I 
             learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher,
             Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our
             One Great Interest in life.  You know, the 
             thing that would really grab us.  Once we did
             that, everything would fall into place.  Like
             hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but 
             collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I
             guess there's no money in that, so she has to 
             be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start
             thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing
             happened.  Until the following summer, in 
             Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found
             it.


     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY

     Todd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in 
     the corner of the garage.  We see that the boxes are filled with
     old war magazines.  Ronny tosses several of them to the ground 
     as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse.  Ronny selects
     one Penthouse and rifles through it.  He discards it a moment
     later. 

                          RONNY 
             One of these has three girls doing it at the
             same time.

     But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention.  He picks one
     up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages.  We
     see a few of the photographs:  Nazi storm troopers, prisoners
     behind barbed wire, the ovens.

                          RONNY (CONT'D) 
             I got it!  Check this out. ...Todd, look. 

                          TODD 
             Hang on a sec. 

     As young Todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes
     in...

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd 
             never seen, stuff they never put in the books
             anymore, especially the ones they give us to
             read.  And here were stacks of them. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Todd speaks excitedly.  Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges
     him.

                          TODD 
             It... grabbed me.  It was just like Miss 
             Harmon said.  I couldn't believe it.  But
             there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the 
             ...the way they saluted each other.  But what
             am I telling you for?  You know more about
             this stuff than anybody. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, what are you telling me for? 

                          TODD 
                    (ignoring him) 
             Then last year I wrote my big term paper on 
             Dachau.  I got an A+.  It was the only A+ she
             gave.  I mean I always do real well.  A's on
             everything.  That's why I'm accelerated. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Accelerated? 

                          TODD 
             You know, accelerated.  I skipped two grades,
             second and ninth.  I didn't need them.
             That's why I'm already a junior. 

     Dussander sits. 

                          DUSSANDER
             I see...

                          TODD 
             Some kids resent me for it.  That's not 
             important.  Anyway, my paper really floored
             my history teacher.  I guess because I got 
             through all those books without throwing up.
             But I learned something.  I learned that when
             you talk about the camps now, you have to 
             remember to sound really disgusted.  I mean,
             you can't just say what happened like the
             magazines did and leave it at that.  If I 
             tried that the teacher would have freaked and
             called my parents in. 


     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DUSK

     Todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old
     magazines.  The door to the house opens and Ronny, looking
     cross, pokes his head out. 

                          RONNY 
             Todd, your mom's on the phone.  She says you
             have to come home for dinner.  ...Todd? 

     Todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice Ronny
     at first.  Then he looks up at him.  In his eyes is a glint of a
     darkness that we will come to know better. 

                          TODD
             What? 

                          RONNY 
                    (suddenly wary of Todd)
             Your mom's on the phone. 

     ANGLE on Todd. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          TODD 
             Nowadays you have to... soften it. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Why do I care about this?

                          TODD 
             Because, I don't want it softened. 

     Todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. Dussander stares at
     him blankly, unsure of where this is going. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I am sure you trouble your parents to no end. 

                          TODD
             Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's
             what my dad says. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You told your parents about me, then? 

                          TODD 
             You think I'm crazy? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I think you're crackers, but go on.  I'm
             riveted.

     Todd looks deep into Dussander's eyes.  Dussander is
     uncomfortable.  Slowly, Todd reaches out and brushes his finger
     against Dussander's hand.  Dussander gets up. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             What are you doing? 

     Pause. 

                          TODD 
             And then it happened... I was on my way to
             the library.  It was raining... 


     FLASHBACK: INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     Todd's voice narrates what we are seeing.  Todd, seated near the
     back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard.  Todd thinks
     nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take
     his eyes off him.  Todd is trying to place the old man's face in
     his mind... 

                          TODD (V.O.)
             You climbed on the bus and started this slow
             walk down the aisle.  Just like you were 
             examining a new batch of inmates.  I don't
             think anybody gave you a second glance but 
             me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out
             of your way.  And under your arm you carried
             a rolled up umbrella.  But what really did 
             it, what really set me off was the coat.  You
             were wearing this long black rain coat.  My
             mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of
             you taken at Patin.  You in your S.S. 
             greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          TODD 
             It was incredible. 

     Dussander stares back at him flatly. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             All of this... because of a rain coat? 

                          TODD 
             Well, it wasn't that easy.  I mean, I had to
             really check up on it.  And every picture of
             you in those books is forty years old, at 
             least.  I went back to the library to find 
             the picture.  And then I matched it with the
             photos I took.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You took photographs of me? 

                          TODD 
             Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right
             in the palm of my hand.

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (crunches cigarette into ashtray) 
             Clever boy.

                          TODD
             But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed
             real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought
             a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a
             book that tells you what you're supposed to
             look for and then dusted your mailbox while
             you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You... put dust on my mailbox?  For 
             fingerprints?  You took photographs of me? 
             What else did you do?... I don't believe any
             of this. 

                          TODD 
             I already had a copy of your fingerprints. 
             They're on your want sheet from the Israeli
             government.  It's on database at UC Irvine.
             Can you believe that? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Bourbon. 

     He storms toward the kitchen and stops. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Would you care for a drink, boy? 

                          TODD 
             Sure, you got a Coke? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             No Kok. 

                          TODD
             Milk? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Milk. 

     Dussander disappears into the kitchen.  Todd stands alone in the
     living room. 

     He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time 
     the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has
     been putting up for Dussander.  He knows he has crossed into
     dangerous territory from which there is no going back.  But 
     after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The
     sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes
     a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear
     him in the kitchen. 

                          TODD 
             It takes eight good matches, they're called 
             compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get 
             accepted in court. 

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             Is that right? 


     FLASHBACK: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY

     Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly.  He pulls
     the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the
     mailbox for prints. 

                          TODD (V.O.)
             Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The 
             first I figured were the mailman's.  Once I 
             knew what I was looking for, yours were easy
             to spot. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             You should be a detective. 

     The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the 
     kitchen.  Drinks being poured.  Todd begins to move slowly
     toward the kitchen. 

                          TODD 
             Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY

     He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks. 

                          TODD 
             I found fourteen compares. 

     Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass
     of bourbon.  He hands the tumbler to Todd, who brings it up to
     his lips and hesitates. 

                          TODD (CONT'D)
             You have some. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Good Gott.

     He snatches the cup and swallows twice. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee
             Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a
             smiling cow. 

     Todd pauses and then begins to drink. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
                    (more to himself than Todd)
             ...And two missing children.
                    (pause) 
             Boy what you have done, I have to explain
             this to you because clearly you don't
             understand, what you have done is a
             violation. 

                          TODD
             A violation? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Yes. 

                          TODD 
             Kind of like those experiments with the
             decompression chamber.  Now, that was a
             violation, Dussander. 

                          DUSSANDER
             That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand
             it. 

                          TODD 
             You what? 

                          DUSSANDER
             I demand -- 

                          TODD 
             You demand nothing from me.  Ever.  Get it?

     Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for 
             the last time.  My name is Arthur Denker.  It
             has never been anything else.  It has never
             even been Americanized.  If you must know,
             and apparently you must, I was named by my
             father who greatly admired the stories of
             Arthur Conan Doyle.  I did serve in the 
             reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, 
             when I was first married, I supported Hitler.
             I supported him most, I suppose, because for
             the first time in years there was work and
             there was tobacco. ...Would you like a 
             cigarette? 

                          TODD 
             No.  My dad used to smoke.  Mom made him
             quit.  Now he's addicted to Nicorette...
             that's nicotine gum. 

     Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match
     from a cabinet.  He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Nicotine gum. 

     Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives 
     neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. 
     He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns
     and continues.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, 
             directing phantom armies at the whim of his 
             astrologer.  He even gave his dog, Blondi, a 
             death capsule.  On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment
             surrendered to the Americans.  I remember
             that a private named Gonzales gave me a
             chocolate bar.  I wept. 

     Bored, Todd sinks into a chair at the table.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             I was interned at Essen where I was treated
             very well.  We listened to the Nuremberg
             trials on the radio and when Goering 
             committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of
             schnaps and got drunk.  When I was released, 
             I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works
             until I retired in 1963.  In 1967 I emigrated
             here, to California, and became a U.S. 
             Citizen.  I am as American as you are.  I 
             vote.  No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no koo-ba.
             And that's it, my whole story.  I hope you're
             satisfied. But if not, it's, as you say, 
             tough shit for you.  Now, you go.  Enough of
             this.

     Dussander points to the door, but Todd remains motionless in his
     chair.

 TODD              That was pretty good.  So much to remember. 
             But I guess it helps when you have forty
             years to practice your story.

 DUSSANDER              Oh, to hell with this and to hell with you. 
             I'm calling the police.  Your father is 
             going to beat your behind when he picks you
             up at the police station. 

 TODD              No.  My parents don't believe in violence. 

 DUSSANDER              Well, they should start.  I'm calling. 

     Dussander steps past Todd and picks up the receiver of the phone
     hanging on the wall above the table.  The boy still sits
     motionless behind him.  Dussander dials a "9", and then, with 
     more difficulty, a "1".  He stands with his finger poised over 
     the final "1".  Tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead.  His
     shoulders drop.  Todd stands up.  Their faces are close
     together. 

 TODD              Hang up the phone. 

 DUSSANDER              This is unforgivable.  Do you know the things
             you're accusing me of? 

 TODD              Do it. 

     Slowly, Dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook.

 DUSSANDER              If you don't want money, what do you want? 

 TODD              I want to hear about it. 

 DUSSANDER              Hear about what? 

 TODD              The camps. Everything.  The experiments. The
             examinations.  All the stuff the writers are
             scared to put in their books because people 
             will think they're sick.  That's what I want,
             ...everything. 

 DUSSANDER              Everything? 

 TODD              Exactly.  And you're going to tell it to me. 

 DUSSANDER              You're a monster. 

 TODD              According to history you're the monster. 

 DUSSANDER              How could you ask me to remember such things?
             I can barely remember to take my heart
             medicine. 

 TODD              You were there.  You did those things.  No
             one can tell it better than you can.  And you
             will tell it, starting today.  Right now.  If
             you don't, I'll tell everyone who you are.  I
             swear it. 

 DUSSANDER              Why should I?  Why should I do any of it? 

 TODD              Because you hung up the phone.  That's why.
             ...And just so you know, just so there is no 
             misunderstanding whatsoever.  Everything I
             have on you, the compares, the want sheet,
             all the photographs, are all in an envelope 
             under my mattress.  I'm going to put it there
             every time I come to see you.  If anything
             happens to me, if I should suddenly 
             disappear, some one will find it.  Believe
             me -- 

 DUSSANDER              That's a foolish thing to do.  What if your 
             mother goes in your room anyway?  What if she
             hires a maid? 

 TODD              You better hope she doesn't.
                    (looking at watch) 
             We're wasting time.  Let's get started.  I
             have to be home for dinner. Today I want to
             hear about the ovens.  How you baked them
             after they were dead... and before. 

     Pause. 

 DUSSANDER                     (to himself)
             A boy... a boy...

 TODD              But before we start, put your teeth in.  You
             look better with your teeth. 


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DUSK 
     It is later the same day.  Todd emerges from the house.  The
     setting sun tells us he has been inside for several hours.  He
     picks up his bike and hops on.  He stops.  He turns to look up
     the street in both directions.  No one.  A moment later he
     pedals off down the street. 


 MAIN TITLES 

 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 
 TITLE: SEPTEMBER 1984 
     A typical high school image.  Rows of students sit listening to 
     a lecture from MR. PROXMIRE, fifties, as he weaves his way
     through the aisles. 

 PROXMIRE              But in 1902, Panama didn't exist.  The 
             country we know as Panama was part of
             Columbia. 

     As the teacher continues to lecture, the camera stops on JOEY,
     17.  On his desk is a folded note. He hands it across the aisle 
     and motions for it to be sent to Todd a few rows over.  The note
     moves across the room, avoiding the meandering teacher, on its
     way to Todd.

 PROXMIRE (CONT'D)              Now the nations of the west knew they needed
             a canal through Central America.  They were
             tired of waiting for their ships to sail 
             around Cape Horn.  This was the new century,
             the age of modernization.  And the U.S. was 
             at the forefront.  Teddy Roosevelt was in the
             White House, looking for any chance to assert
             the might of America.  When Columbia balked
             at the offer made by the U.S. and England, 
             Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off
             the coast of Panama, just sit there, where
             they could be seen from the coast. 

     The FEMALE STUDENT across the aisle from Todd now has the note.
     She whispers to him but he doesn't hear.  Todd is trying to say
     awake with great difficulty.

     The girl extends the note just as Proxmire passes.  He stops,
     turns around, plucks the note from the girl's hand and heads for
     the front of the class. 

 PROXMIRE (CONT'D)              Finally Columbia gave up the territory for 
             about a tenth of its original price.  And as
             Roosevelt would say later, "The U.S. stole
             the Panama canal fair and square."

     Without glancing at it, Proxmire crumples the note and drops it
     into the waste basket by his desk. 


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY 
     It is in between classes.  The denizens of STUDENTS crowd around
     their lockers.  Among them is Todd.  He searches through his
     locker and selects a book.  Suddenly the door SLAMS shut to 
     reveal the face of Joey standing against the lockers.  Todd,
     startled, jumps back. 

 JOEY                     (laughs) 
             Take it easy, Jesus.  It's just me, flinch-
             man. 

 TODD                     (serious)
             Don't do that. 

 JOEY              I got news for you.  You're gonna like it. 

 TODD              Walk with me to French. 

     The two walk down the corridor.

 JOEY              Someone likes you.  Someone good. 

 TODD              Who? 

 JOEY              Well, I heard my sister talking on the phone
             with Lisa Herman, and... well -- 

 TODD              You going to tell me who it is? 

     Two CHEERLEADERS pass them.

 JOEY                     (lowering voice) 
             You didn't hear it from me. 

 TODD              Fine. 

 JOEY              Becky Trask. 

 TODD              Was that so hard? 

 JOEY              So ask her out and the weekend after next you
             can double with me and Vanessa. 

 TODD              What about this weekend? 

 JOEY              I'm already planning on being grounded. 

 TODD              Grounded?  What for? 

 JOEY              Where the hell you been?  Report cards were
             sent out today.  I know that never affects 
             you... 

     They arrive at the door of Todd's classroom as the BELL SOUNDS.

 JOEY (CONT'D)              Shit.  Don't forget what I told you. 

     Joey runs off, leaving Todd looking after him. 


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY 
 TITLE: OCTOBER 1984 
     It is late afternoon.  Dussander sits in a rocking chair facing 
     out into the backyard.  Todd is in the lawn chair off to the
     side.  He has just finished a McDonald's cheeseburger and is 
     about to start another one.  Dussander eats a Big Mac, washing
     it down with bourbon.  A large cat keeps jumping onto 
     Dussander's lap while he is eating.  He brushes it away annoyed. 

 TODD              I've never seen anyone drink bourbon with
             McDonald's before.  ...So, How did the stuff
             get to Patin? 

 DUSSANDER              In railroad cars marked "Medical Supplies." 
             It came in long crates that looked like coffins. 

 TODD              That's fitting.  Was it always Zyklon-B?

     The cat jumps into Dussander's lap again.  He throws it down,
     this time harder.

 DUSSANDER              No, from time to time we would be sent 
             something else.  Experimental gases.  The
             High Command was always interested in 
             improving efficiency.  Once they sent us a
             gas code-named "Pegasus."  A nerve gas. 
             Thank God they never sent it again.  It...

     Todd sits up a little, leaning in. 

 TODD              It what? 

 DUSSANDER              It didn't work very well.  It was quite boring.

 TODD              Bullshit.  You're lying.  What did it do? 

 DUSSANDER              It killed them.  What do you think it did,
             made them walk on water?  It killed them. 

     The cat jumps up a third time.  This time Dussander picks it up
     and tosses it a good six feet.  The animal hits the ground and runs away.

 TODD              Tell me. 
                    (slurps on his Coke)
             Tell me. 

 DUSSANDER              I won't.  I refuse.  Where are my cigarettes? 

     He finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips.  He
     lights it.  Todd watches calmly, giving the old man a moment to
     collect himself, and then... 

 TODD              What did it do? 

 DUSSANDER              It made them dance. 

 TODD              Dance? 

 DUSSANDER              Like Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower
             heads.  After a few seconds the prisoners 
             began to leap about.  Some were screaming.
             Most of them were laughing.  They began to
             vomit and to... to defecate helplessly. 

 TODD              You mean they... they... shit themselves?
             ...Woah. 

     But Dussander ignores him, staring out into the yard as he
     begins to remember more easily. 

 DUSSANDER              They began to twitch all over and make high,
             strange sounds in their throats.  At last
             they collapsed and just lay there on the 
             concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood
             streaming from their noses.  But I lied to
             you, boy.  It didn't kill them.  Either 
             because it wasn't strong enough or because we
             couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long.
             I suppose it was that.  I sent five men in 
             with rifles to end their agonies.  These were
             five men I trusted.  It would have looked bad
             on my record to have wasted so many 
             cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had 
             declared every cartridge a national resource.
             I was always given high marks for efficiency. 

 TODD              Yeah, I bet. 

     Dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap. As
     if his own story has suddenly disgusted him, he balls the food
     up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag. 

 DUSSANDER              How do you eat this crap everyday? 

 TODD              Why didn't you just do the job yourself? You
             carried a gun, didn't you? 

 DUSSANDER                     (incredulous) 
             I was the commandant of the camp.

 TODD              So you never killed anybody? 

 DUSSANDER                     (getting frustrated) 
             The entire world was at war, boy.  People died. 

 TODD              That's not a real answer.  I'm asking about
             you. 

 DUSSANDER              Boy, I was a soldier in a position of power.
             You don't get to be there by selling ...girl
             scout's cookies. 

 TODD              I know what the SS was, Dussander.  Who are
             you talking to?  It was a bunch of dumb, rich
             kids who bought their way into the service so
             they wouldn't have to go fight on the front. 

     Dussander stares at Todd, wanting to say something.  Todd
     shovels a few more fries into his mouth, then looks up and sees
     Dussander eyeing him. 

 DUSSANDER              That's enough for today, boy.  I beg you.
             I'm tired. 

 TODD              Yeah, fine.  That was good story though.  You
             always tell them good, once I get you started. 

     ANGLE on Dussander. 


     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #1: EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

     Dussander is asleep in his bed.  A low groaning sound comes in
     very slowly.  Dussander's eyes open.  He sits up, looks around,
     sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field.  It is
     grassy, but certainly not beautiful.  Something is wrong about 
     this place.

     He stands out of the bed, wearing pajamas.  But it is cold.  He
     takes the sheet and wraps himself in it.  The groaning is
     getting louder, more human.  We have never seen him frightened,
     until now.  He steps a few paces from the bed.  The groans have
     becomes low screams.  There is no where to go.  Slowly, as if he
     knows what he's going to see, he looks down at the ground.  It's
     just grass.  But the human voices are now wailing desperately. 

     His knees buckle, but he tries to fight it.  He reaches his 
     knees and lowers his head toward the ground.  The white sheet
     flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind.  The screams
     are now at a feverish pitch.  His ear is inches from the grass
     and his eyes, marked with unmistakable terror, are wide open
     as...


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Dussander bolts upright in his bed.


 EXT. OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 
     RICHARD (DICK) BOWDEN, 38, is a taller, grayer version of his
     son.  He stands over Todd's shoulder watching him shoot at a 
     paper target.  He still has on a tie from work, but the knot has
     been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up.  Both Dick and
     Todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses.  Dick chews
     gum.  They are alone on the range.

     Todd fires a few rounds from his father's .30-.30.  A strained
     tension exists between the two Bowdens. 

 DICK              You're tight.  Don't hold your breath so long.

 TODD              Forget it.  I can't concentrate. 

     He pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to
     his father.  Dick takes it and begins to reload it for him. 

 DICK              I know your upset.  So am I.  So is your
             mother. 

 TODD              These honors classes... they aren't as easy 
             as I thought they'd be.  I totally admit it,
             I didn't prepare enough.  I'm sorry. 

 DICK              Well, fine, but now is not the time to slack 
             off.  You got a chance to finish at the top of
             your class--

 TODD              Nobody wants that more than I do, Dad.

 DICK              Well you haven't been hitting the books very
             much. 

 TODD              I know... 

 DICK              And seeing as you're not playing soccer this
             year it's not like you don't have enough
             time-- 

 TODD              That still bothers you, doesn't it? 

 DICK                     (with difficulty)
             No, son. If you weren't enjoying it, then
             you shouldn't play.

 TODD              I think it bothers you and you're not telling
             me. 

     Dick decides to take a shot himself.  He readies himself and
     fires. 

 DICK              That was lousy.  Here. 
                    (gives the gun back to Todd) 
             I want to see your grades come up, buddy. 
             That's all that bothers me.  And if you say 
             you need more time to study, then that's what
             we'll do.  The first thing is to cut out all
             the time you spend reading to Mr. Denker. 
             It's a nice thing to do, but it's not helping
             our school work a bit. 

     Dick is looking at his son, unsure if he has just seen a
     contortion of rage on his son's face.  But Todd is cocking the
     rifle and...

 DICK (CONT'D)              Hey, Todd.  You still with me? 

 TODD              Yeah... no.  Dad, don't do that.  Please.
             Don't punish Mr. Denker for something that's
             my fault.  I mean, he'd be lost without me-- 

 DICK              He'll be fine without you. He was fine before
             and he'll be fine after. There's nothing 
             wrong with wanting to help people, but you
             gotta make sure you got yourself squared away
             first. That's what matters. 

     Todd turns to face his father, and speaks to him with a new
     seriousness.

 TODD              Dad, am I like other kids? 

 DICK              Not by a long shot. 

 TODD              Then trust me on this.  Don't lose faith in
             me because I blew a couple of exams.  I will
             get my grades back up.  In fact I've already
             started.  Three days a week I go over to 
             Freddy Tremain's for extra help. He's a wiz
             at trig. But please, Dad, whatever you do, 
             don't punish a helpless old man for something
             that's my fault. 

     Pause. 

 DICK              Did you practice that in front of a mirror or
             something?

     Todd smiles.  Feeling his father caving in, he aims the rifle and 
     squeezes off a round.  Dick keeps his eyes on Todd as he shoots.

 DICK (CONT'D)              Hey, he's not...?

 TODD                     (it takes him a second)
             ...No.

 DICK              Just checking. 
                    (thinks for a moment) 
             All right... We'll give your way a shot. If
             you think you can do it, if you really do,
             and your serious, then... okay. 
             You really like the old guy, don't you?

 TODD              I'm making a difference in somebody's life. 
             It's that simple.

     Todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger.  The gun
     jams.  Todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck. 

 DICK              Okay, okay. 
                    (takes the rifle) 
             Don't ever force it.  Watch. 

     Dick begins to methodically unjam the gun. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DUSK 
 TITLE: NOVEMBER 1984 
     Dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes.  His clothes
     and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal 
     appearance.  He goes to the basement door and, leaning carefully
     over the steps, retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash, stored
     precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement.  He
     comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open.  Todd's
     irritated voice booms in from the living room.

 TODD (O.S.)              Don't get too drunk.  We still have a little
             while. 

     Dussander mumbles contemptuously and then speaks so Todd can
     hear him.

 DUSSANDER              You don't have to do that, you know. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK 
     Todd has built a fire, probably the first fire Dussander's
     fireplace has seen in twenty years.  The room is bathed in a
     warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside.  Todd uses the
     poker to adjust one of the logs. 

 TODD              Screw you.  I'm doing this for me.  This
             place is freezing. 

     Dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy
     chair, which has been positioned in front of the hearth.

 DUSSANDER              Yes, it must be fifty degrees outside.  I'm
             sure to you it seems positively frigid.

 TODD              Why didn't you pay your gas bill?

 DUSSANDER              It slipped my mind.  I will attend to it
             tomorrow. 

 TODD              Slipped your mind.  I noticed it didn't slip
             your mind to stock up on a new case of
             bourbon. 

 DUSSANDER              Leave me alone. 

     Todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet
     away.

 TODD              All right, so finish your story, because I'm
             still not clear.  You cook up this stew, and
             you bring the prisoner in, and you let them
             smell it, and suddenly they tell you
             everything? 

 DUSSANDER              Oh, don't misunderstand me.  Certainly with a
             pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner 
             would tell us everything we wanted to know, 
             sometimes more.  But mine was a much more ...
             elegant method.  Remember, it had been months
             since they had smelled real potatoes
             simmering over an open flame, and boy, when
             that delicious odor hit their noses their
             mouths would drop and out would pour an
             account of every minor infraction their
             friends had committed, I mean it was
             magnificent...

 TODD              And you let them eat the soup? 

 DUSSANDER              Oh, we never promised them the soup in 
             exchange for information.  We never mentioned
             it at all. 

     Pause.  Todd is impressed. 

 TODD              Wow, that's really good, Dussander.  I mean
             that's...
                    (pointing)
             that's thinking. 

     Dussander does not respond.  He gazes deeply into the fire.

 DUSSANDER              ...But, as the war pressed on, the time for
             such civilized measures became a luxury.  I
             remember by April of '45, we had barely
             enough food to feed ourselves.  The sound of
             the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but
             still, the train cars from France and Poland
             kept coming.  This was a time of desperation.
             The ovens burned day and night and still I
             knew we would not beat the arrival of the
             Russian forces.  Many of my men, the cowardly
             ones, deserted during the night.  But the men
             that remained, the same ones I had called
             upon so many times, ...continued the work.
             At first we thought a massive fire in the
             main building would serve our purpose.  We
             could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch
             up to each of the windows.  But with so many
             of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would
             burn properly.  We needed something
             ...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I
             shall never forget his enthusiastic smile,
             pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the
             Western gate which had been used during
             construction.  How perfectly simple it was.
             The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four
             meters deep, down the center of the camp.
             For two hours they dug until I realized we
             may not have enough gas to finish the job.
             So the inmates were given shovels and told
             they were building a shelter from the
             incoming artillery.  When they were done, I
             immediately called for a practice drill and
             three thousand naked bodies began to march
             into the trench.  It took less than twenty
             minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the
             bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit
             sending the piles of earth into the massive
             grave.  Those who tried to free themselves
             were shot, of course, but very few cartridges
             were wasted that day.  The machines were too
             fast.  Back and forth they went... packing
             the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of
             gas and my men had to scurry along with
             shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I
             gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance
             the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like
             an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that
             no matter what happened, ...no one would ever
             forget what we did here.

     Dussander stares into the fire.  Todd, wide-eyed, is locked on
     Dussander when...

     The PHONE RINGS.

     They look at each other, a bit puzzled.  Clearly, it does not
     ring very often, and when it does, Dussander cannot help but be
     apprehensive.

     It rings again.  Dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen,
     Todd watches him go. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Hello? 
                    (Pause. Then with apprehension) 
             Yes? ...No, no trouble at all. ...Yes.
             ...Yes, he's here. ...I see.
                    (his face softens) 
             ...Really? ...No, no plans. ...Ah, lovely. 
             ...My dear, I'd be delighted. ...Certainly.
             ...Of course I will. ...Yes, until then.
             ...All right. ...Good-bye. 

     He hangs up and turns to Todd with a odd grin. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              It seems I am to be your guest for
             Thanksgiving dinner.


 INT. OLD TOYOTA CAR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
     Todd and Becky are in the backseat of Becky's car.  They are on
     a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the
     lights of their town.  At 16, BECKY TRASK, is an attractive girl
     who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes
     them.  They are kissing in the back seat.  MUSIC plays on the
     stereo.  Becky's blouse is unbuttoned.  She stops kissing Todd. 

 BECKY              Is everything all right? 

 TODD              Yeah, I'm fine. 

     Becky smiles to herself, unconvinced. 

 BECKY              You're nervous.  I think it's sweet. 

 TODD              No... No, I'm cool. 

 BECKY              Do you want me to do something else? 

     Todd just stares at her.  He doesn't know what he wants.  Becky
     decides for him.  She slides down out of the frame.  Todd is
     startled at first, but lets her.  After a moment, he closes his
     eyes. 


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - NIGHT 
     Dussander sits in his rocking chair.  A small blanket drapes
     across his lap.  He smokes a cigarette and holds a near-empty
     glass.  On the ground beside him, there is a small bowl.

 DUSSANDER              Here kitty-kitty.  Here kitty-kitty. 

     Out in the yard, the large cat emerges from the darkness and
     moves across the grass.  It sees Dussander and, more 
     importantly, the bowl next to him.  We see that the bowl is
     filled with milk. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Come, puss-puss.  That's right.  I'll wait. 

     Dussander sits perfectly still.  Cautiously, the cat moves
     toward the porch. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              That's right, puss-puss.  You can smell it
             now, can't you? 

     The cat creeps to the edge of the steps.  It takes them one at a
     time.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              That's right, kitty-kitty.  That's right.

     After a moment the cat edges up to the bowl.  Its tail twitches
     nervously.  Finally, it begins to lick up the milk.  Dussander
     crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass.  His movements
     are slow and patient.  From under the blanket he pulls a pair of
     yellow rubber gloves.  He begins to put them on.  The cat jumps
     back for a moment.  Dussander freezes.  He waits the cat out. 
     Soon the animal is back at the bowl.  Dussander continues with
     the gloves.  He watches the cat's tail.  As the animal gets
     comfortable, its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair.
     Dussander slams the chair back.  The CAT SHRIEKS.  Dussander
     flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight,
     squirming, HISSING bundle.  He stands out of the chair. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Gotcha. 


 INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
     It is later.  Becky sits behind the wheel.  Todd is next to her.
     A different song is on the RADIO.  They sit for a moment in
     silence, clearly uncomfortable. 

 TODD              I'm sorry. 

 BECKY              It's all right.  Maybe you'll be more in the
             mood later. 

 TODD              I don't know.  That's never happened before. 

     Becky lights a joint.  She takes a puff and exhales toward Todd.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Can you blow that the other way? 

 BECKY              Maybe you don't like me. 

 TODD              No, I do. 

 BECKY                     (exhaling out the window)
             Maybe you don't like girls. 

     For a moment it is as though Todd's face were purple with rage.
     But a moment later the expression is gone.  Todd turns away.
     Becky sees that her comment has hurt him. 

 BECKY (CONT'D)              That was a lousy thing for me to say.  I'm
             sorry, honey.

     She kisses him on the cheek.  He nods reluctantly. 

 TODD              Let's just go home. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander bursts through the door with the bundle.  A single paw
     emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at Dussander, 
     clawing him across the neck.

 DUSSANDER              Oww, you mother-fucker. 

     They move across the room to the stove.  With difficulty,
     Dussander pulls open the oven door, revealing the glowing red
     interior.  The animal SCREAMS and claws at Dussander's neck and
     arms, escaping more and more from the blanket with every 
     gyration of its body.  With a mighty shove Dussander plunges the
     cat toward the opening, but the animal braces its paws on the
     edge of the stove.  The two are deadlocked.  But Dussander's 
     hands are too close to the heat.  He screams.  His grip loosens
     just enough.  With a desperate cry, the animal charges up
     Dussander's body, over his head, and leaps to the floor.
     Dussander dives after it. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Come here! 

     But the animal is too swift.  In a second, it is atop the
     counter and out the open window above the sink.  Although
     defeated and exhausted, Dussander cannot contain his excitement.
     His panting gives way to a twisted, hearty laugh. 


     TODD'S DAYDREAM: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

     This is a 1940's laboratory.  Todd is in his boxer shorts.
     Dussander is next to him, wearing a lab coat and his S.S.
     officers hat.  Todd looks down on the examination table.  A
     YOUNG GIRL, about 16, is held to the table with clamps.  She is 
     naked, staring at Todd.  Behind the table is a glass window and 
     behind that is another room where OTHER SCIENTISTS are
     monitoring equipment.

     Over Dussander's methodical voice, Todd's dream shows flashes of
     what is being done: some sort of sexual experiment on the girl. 

 DUSSANDER                     (to other scientists) 
             Test run eight-four.  Electricity, sexual 
             stimulus, metabolism.  Based on the Thyssen
             theories of negative reinforcement. 

     Dreamlike SOUNDS and images pass before us: Todd's breathing,
     the girl's cry, electrical equipment, naked flesh, maybe
     Todd's, maybe the girl's. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Subject is a young Jewish girl, approximately 
             sixteen years of age, no scars, no
             identifying marks, no known disabilities -- 

     Inside the control room, a SCIENTIST monitors a volt meter, 
     calling out the readings as Dussander yells for the voltage to
     be increased.  As the meter rises, the girl SCREAMS more 
     violently.  Perhaps her eyes roll back, her tongue flutters in 
     her mouth.  Through all of this, the scientists call out and the
     record heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, voltage, etc.
     Todd's eyes close.  His breathing accelerates as does the motion
     of his hips until... 


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 
     Todd snaps out of his daydream.  His trigonometry class is
     having an examination.  He sits at his desk, staring blankly at
     the paper before him.  Most of the answer spaces are empty.  He
     knows he is going to fail another test. 


 EXT. OUTOOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 
     Todd is blasting away, rapid-firing the rifle down range at an
     unfortunate paper target.  The protective headphones lay on the
     counter beside him, as does his backpack.  He stops shooting
     when a voice snaps over the P.A. speaker next to him. 

 VOICE (O.S.)              You, on lane twelve.  You need to have your 
             headgear on at all times. (click) And no
             rapid firing.

     Todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small
     booth.  Todd puts on the headgear, and after a moment, the man 
     goes back to reading a newspaper.  Todd looks up and down the 
     range.  One or two other shooters are concentrating on their 
     targets.  Todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the 
     man in the booth.  He snaps off a single dry round.  Todd smiles
     weakly at the sound of the click.  Unnoticed by anyone, he turns
     back toward the target, strangely comforted.


 INT. DINING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY 
     Thanksgiving dinner.  All the Bowden's are there, including
     Dick's parents, VICTOR and AGNES. Dussander sits at the head of 
     the table, Todd next to him.  The family has finished dinner and
     is having coffee.  Dick and his father smoke cigars.  Todd's 
     mother, MONICA BOWDEN, still pretty at 36, pours Dussander some
     more coffee. 

 MONICA              Todd loved that dog.  A lot more than Dick 
             did. 

 DICK              We all loved that dog. 

 AGNES              I remember when you had to put it down, Todd
             cried for two weeks.  Just about broke my
             heart. 

 DUSSANDER              Excuse, me, Mrs. Bowden.  Put it down?  I've
             been here over twenty years but that's a new
             one. 

 VICTOR              Means put it to sleep, Victor.

     Dussander still looks puzzled.  He looks to Todd, but Victor
     jumps in.

 VICTOR (CONT'D)              Well, it's how they kill it, Arthur. They do
             it all the time at the pound, ...sick dogs,
             dogs nobody wants.

 MONICA              It's very humane.

 DUSSANDER              I see. 

     Todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others don't notice.

 MONICA              Some more pie? 

 DUSSANDER              As my departed wife used to say, 'One must
             never overdo the sublime.' 

 AGNES              It was delicious, Monica. 

 VICTOR              Tell me, Arthur, if you don't mind me asking.
             What did you do during the war? 

 AGNES              Now don't get too personal, Victor. 

     A quick moment between Todd and Dussander.

 DUSSANDER              I was a student at the University until my
             reserve unit was called in 1943.
                    (notices Victor) 
             But we were not a combat unit, thank God.
             Mechanical engineers.  Help me find my 
             cigarettes, Todd.  Would you?  In those days,
             not even the call of higher learning could
             exempt an able body from military service.

     Dussander's cigarettes are right in front of him.  Todd fetches
     one and, bringing it to his own lips, lights it for him.

 MONICA              Todd Bowden!

 DUSSANDER                     (laughs knowingly) 
             My dear, I do apologize.  My hands are too
             arthritic to strike a match, I'm afraid. 
             Your son has been good enough to help an old
             man with his filthy habits. 

 MONICA              Well...as long as you don't inhale. 

 TODD              Cigarettes are gross, Mom. 

 VICTOR              Well, Victor, you were doing your part like
             we all were, I suppose.  Of course, if you 
             were in the Pacific Fleet I'd have to shoot
             you. 

     Everyone laughs, except Todd.

 DICK                     (to Dussander) 
             My dad is very proud of the fact that the
             Bowden men have hit every major conflict
             since the Civil War. 

 VICTOR              That's right.  Dickie served two tours in 
             Vietnam.  Earned a bronze star and a purple
             heart. 

 DICK              It's one family tradition I'd like to put an
             end to.  Todd and I blow a few caps down at 
             the range every week.  That's all the combat
             he needs.

 TODD                     (perking up, offended) 
             What's that supposed to mean? 

 DICK              Forget it. 

 DUSSANDER                     (looking at Todd) 
             Perhaps your son would excel in combat. 

 MONICA              Todd could excel at anything.  Right, honey?

     Todd doesn't answer.  His eyes are still on Dick.  Dick notices
     him. 

 AGNES                     (getting up, starts to clear some
                    dishes) 
             Oh, let's don't even talk about this. I can't
             stand to think of you boys fighting another
             war.

 DUSSANDER              The Purple Heart.  You were injured? 

 TODD              He was knocked unconscious and woke up in a
             hospital.

     A long pause.  Dick is embarrassed and offended by Todd's stab.
     He puffs on his cigar.  Agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks
     up some more dishes.  Dick stands suddenly to help her.

 DICK              Mom, let me get that for you. 


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SIDEWALK - NIGHT 
     Todd and Dussander walk together in silence.  Todd is clearly in
     a bad mood.  Dussander prods him.

 DUSSANDER              You shouldn't be so hard on your father. 

 TODD              Why don't you mind your own business. 

 DUSSANDER                     (amused at Todd's short fuse) 
             Boy, It's not so easy to raise children. Your
             father does the best he can, I'm sure. Having 
             his own father there is bound to cause some
             anxiety on his part-- 

 TODD              Oh, give me a frigging break, will you?  Look
             who's talking to me, for Christ's sake.  And
             what was that crap about the dog?  If you 
             were any more charming I was going to puke. 

 DUSSANDER              Heavens, boy, wasn't that precisely the 
             point?  I used the evening to our advantage. 

 TODD              Our advantage?  Our advantage?

 DUSSANDER              Certainly now they will offer no objections 
             if you continue to come over and read to me. 

 TODD              You sure take a lot for granted.  Do you 
             think there's anybody forcing me to come over
             to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up
             booze all day?  Do you? 

 DUSSANDER              Lower your voice.  People will hear. 

 TODD              So what?

     Dussander stops. 

 DUSSANDER              No, nobody forces you to come.  In fact, you
             are welcome to stay away.  Believe me, boy, I
             have no scruples about drinking alone.  None
             at all.

     They start walking again.  Dussander turns up his driveway.
     Todd follows.

 TODD              You know, if they found out what you are,
             they'd spit on you. 

 DUSSANDER              I am sure they would have nothing but 
             revulsion for me.  But what would they say
             about you, boy, when I told them you had 
             known about me for nine months... and said
             nothing? 

     Dussander unlocks his door and steps in.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Come and see me if you please, and stay home
             if you don't.  Good night, boy.

     He closes the door. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
 TITLE: DECEMBER 1984 
     Todd places a brightly wrapped Christmas present on the table in
     front of Dussander, who looks at it skeptically. 

 TODD              Go ahead, open it.  Wait, I better pull down
             the shades, first. 

 DUSSANDER              What for? 

 TODD              Just to be safe. 

 DUSSANDER                     (getting up) 
             To hell with this.  You open it. 

 TODD              Oh, relax, old man.  Sit down and open it. 

     Todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of Coke.
     Dussander slowly sits back down. 

 DUSSANDER              You wrapped it yourself, I see. 

     He begins to remove the bow, and then the paper.  He moves very
     cautiously, as if the package might explode at any moment.

     Finally, he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one
     of fear to one of exasperation. 

 TODD              Merry Christmas!

     We see that the box contains a replica of an officer's S.S. 
     uniform, complete with hat and jackboots.  Dussander reads the
     label.

 DUSSANDER              Pete's Quality Costume Clothiers - Serving 
             You Since 1976.

 TODD              Go ahead, try it on. 

 DUSSANDER              Are you out of your mind, boy?  What makes 
             you think I would put something like that on? 

 TODD              I thought you'd like it --

 DUSSANDER              Like it?  My God, you're a bigger fool than I
             thought.  Maybe I'll put it on and do a 
             little shopping downtown.  Is that what you
             thought?  You stupid, boy. 

 TODD              Don't call me stupid. 

 DUSSANDER              You... You know, you are correct.  I am the 
             stupid one.  For months I have suffered your
             indignities.  I have exposed my past to you 
             while watching you stuff your face with those
             wretched hamburgers.  I have stocked my 
             refrigerator with Coca Cola and ding dongs. 
             All for you, I have done these things and I'm
             tired of it.  But because I value my life and 
             my freedom, what's left of it anyway, I do
             them.  But I'll die before I put this thing
             on, you fucking piss-ant. 

 TODD              That's enough.  You don't get to talk to me
             like that. 

     Dussander bangs the table.

 DUSSANDER              I should smash you. 

 TODD              Do it.  Please.
                    (pause) 
             Indignities?  What you've suffered with me is
             nothing compared to what the Israelis would
             do to you.  Remember what happened to 
             Eichmann?  You forget that, I think.  And,
             you know, that's my fault.  I have let you
             forget.  You have gotten comfortable with
             this situation.  Well, don't you for one 
             minute ever forget who holds the cards here.
             Don't you ever forget that envelope under my 
             mattress.  I tried to do this the nice way, I
             tried to do something to please you, but you 
             don't want it.  So fine, we'll do it the hard
             way.  You will put this on because I want to 
             see you in it.  Now strip.

 DUSSANDER              I hope you go to hell -- 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     It is five minutes later.  Dussander stands in the uniform.  He
     looks at it indignantly.

 DUSSANDER              The insignia is all wrong.  The boots should
             be leather, not imitation. 

 TODD              That suit cost me over eighty bucks... with
             the boots. 

 DUSSANDER              And this material... what?  Polyester? 

 TODD              Quiet.  Straighten that hat. 

     Dussander ignores him.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Straighten that hat, soldier!

 DUSSANDER              Good Gott. 

     Dussander does what he is told. 

 TODD              Actung!

     Slowly Dussander straightens up.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Now, march... Do it!

     Dussander begins to move his feet in place. 

 TODD (CONT'D)              That's it.  March.

     Dussander has gotten into a rhythm, marching faster in place.

 TODD (CONT'D)              About face.

     Dussander spins sharply on his heels.  He continues to march.

 TODD (CONT'D)              About face. 

     Dussander is stomping in place vigorously.  He spins on command,
     facing Todd.  He gives a Nazi salute.  Todd watches him march
     for a moment.  At first he enjoys the domination, but as 
     Dussander gets caught up in the marching, Todd's expression changes. 

 TODD (CONT'D)              Okay, that's enough. 

     Dussander is still marching furiously. 

 TODD (CONT'D)              I said that's enough! 

     Suddenly Dussander stops.  He collapses into a chair, exhausted.
     He sits there panting for a moment. 

 DUSSANDER              Boy... be careful. You play with fire. 


     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #2: INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Dussander wakes to a strange, faint rumble.  He climbs out of
     bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound.
     We follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed.
     Soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his
     room.  Yet he is still in darkness, as if his room has suddenly
     ended and continues into a black void.

     But the rumble gets louder, more mechanical sounding.  As the
     sound crescendoes we see what Dussander sees.  A train car.
     Steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a
     complete stop in the night.

     Dussander stares at the boxcar coldly, and we realize that
     something is staring back at him.  Eyes, dozens of them, glare
     back at him from between the slatted boards of the train.  Some
     are low to the flooe, like those of children.  Others are
     higher.  Dussander snaps at them in German.

 DUSSANDER                     (in German)
             Come out. ...Come out, now!

	 No one exits the train.  Yet, the eyes seem to move around
     cautiously within the boxcar.  Dussander is getting angry.  His
     orders aren't being carried out.  Suddenly the door of the train
     slides open.  But still only the eyes are visible.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)                     (in German)
             Line up in front of the train. Now!

     Again, no one gets off.  Enraged, Dussander takes a few steps
     toward the train.  In a flash the eyes charge at him.  But these
     are not the eyes of prisoners.  These are wolves.  Dussander can
     only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend
     upon him.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Dussander wakes from his nightmare in a cold sweat. His pajamas
     are soaked. Disoriented and out of breath, he climbs out of bed
     and clicks on the light.

     The closet. He stares at the closed closet door for a moment and
     then moves toward it slowly. He opens the door and runs his
     fingers across the assortment of shirts and jackets. His hand
     stops near the back.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER 
     Dussander is seated on the side of the bed smoking a cigarette.
     He is dressed, with the exception of the boots and hat, in the 
     SS uniform.  He appears calmer, less agitated.  He crunches out
     the cigarette and slips under the covers.  He turns off the
     light.  He closes his eyes.  For the moment, he is at peace.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY 
     Todd stands facing his open locker.  He is staring at his report
     card.  Sweat collects on his forehead.  He looks like he is 
     about to explode.  He wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns
     around to see if anyone notices him.  TWO STUDENTS catch his 
     eye.  They are both Asian.  They are smiling and pouring over 
     each other's report cards.  Todd zips open his backpack, giving
     us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside.  He
     throws the report card in and zips up the bag.  Slinging the bag
     over his shoulder, he slams the locker shut and heads off down
     the hall.


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY 
     Todd is shooting baskets with Joey.  It is after school.  Todd
     wears a white T-shirt.  Off to the side, we see the dress shirt
     he was wearing earlier and his school bag.  

 JOEY              So what are you going to do? 

 TODD              Fuck if I know.  

     Todd throws up a clumsy shot.  It misses.  

 JOEY              You're throwing it flat.  Let it roll off
             your fingers more.  

 TODD                     (snapping at him)
             I don't need a lesson.  

     Todd adjusts his grip on the ball anyway.  He shoots again.  No
     good.  

 JOEY              Your dad, man.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm a
             fuck up.  My dad is used to this crap from 
             me.  

     Todd does not respond to his friend's attempt at humor.   He is
     slamming the ball around with great force.  He bounces it hard
     off the back wall to give himself a rebound.  He is mumbling to
     himself.  

 JOEY              What? 

 TODD              What? 

 JOEY              You said something? 

 TODD              No.

 JOEY              You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  It's not
             the first time I've noticed it.  What is 
             going on with you?

 TODD              Nothing, Joey.  I fucked up.  I'II fix it.  
             I'II fix it.  

 JOEY                     (hurt) 
             All right, man.  Whatever you say.  Look, I
             got to get to practice.  

     No response from Todd.  

 JOEY (CONT'D)              If you need to talk, you can call me.  You
             know that.  I'II see you around.  

     Joey walks off.  Todd continues shooting the ball.  

 TODD                     (mumbling) 
             You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  You're
             talking to yourself, Bowden.  

     He throws up a shot.  It is good.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              I'II fix it.  I'II fix it.  

     A strange SQUAWKING sound is heard.  Todd doesn't hear it at
     first, but as the sound grows louder Todd stops the ball and 
     looks around.  His eyes focus on the area near an open doorway.
     Sunlight streams into the empty gym.  Todd walks closer, seeing
     that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled 
     in from outside.  He goes up to it.  The bird is black.  Its 
     wing is damaged.  It SQUAWKS loudly, looking up at Todd.  Todd
     begins mumbling again.  He starts to dribble the ball 
     thoughtlessly.  As his words become clearer, the bouncing gets
     harder.

 TODD (CONT'D)              I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  

     Todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him.  The bird
     continues to SCREAM.  Slowly the ball drifts from beside Todd to
     in front of him, gaining force with every bounce.  He brings it
     up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his
     might.  When it comes back up, it is smeared with blood.  He
     throws it down again, this time it comes up with feathers
     smeared in the blood.  The squawking has stopped.  Blood
     splatters on Todd's shirt.  His eyes close.  

     He stops the ball, looks around.  No one has seen him.  He 
     notices his shirt.  Calmly, he tears it off, wraps the ball in
     it, and tosses it in a nearby trash can.  


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 
     Todd pedals his bike through town, carrying a brown paper bag 
     under one arm.  He turns down Dussander's street.  He stops in
     front of the house and heads for the front door.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     Dussander emerges from the basement just as Todd comes into the
     kitchen.  Todd sniffs the air, frowns.  

 TODD              What the fuck happened in here?

 DUSSANDER              Ah, boy...  I burned my TV dinner, I'm afraid.  

 TODD              Something's come up.  Sit down.  

     Dussander's studies Todd for a moment.  Although Todd appears
     calm, his tone reflects a somber, business-like attitude.

 DUSSANDER              I see.  
                    (sits at table) 
             What seems to be the trouble? 

     Todd sets his grade card and the envelope on the table.
     Dussander picks up the grade card and examines it.  

 DUSSANDER              Quarterly Progress Report.
                    (he reads silently) 
             You seem to have fallen on the rocks, my boy.
             One B, three C's and a D.  Hardly the work of
             a "National Merit Scholar," or whatever you
             call yourself.  

 TODD              This isn't a joke, Dussander.  I can't blame
             this on teachers or honors classes anymore.  

 DUSSANDER              Looks like you have a problem then.  

 TODD              I have a problem?  You still don't get it.  
             I'm out of excuses.  Do you know what's going
             to happen when my dad sees that?  He's going 
             to hit the fucking roof.  He'll get it all
             out of me.  The truth, you...everything.  

 DUSSANDER              Boy, it's not my fault your grades have 
             fallen.  

 TODD              Don't be so sure.  

     Dussander throws Todd a dismissive wave.  He gets up to get a drink 

 DUSSANDER              Please, you don't spend that much time here.
             I hardly think--

 TODD                     (quickly, as if confessing something) 
             I can't study anymore. 

     Pause.  Dussander looks at him oddly, a bit surprised.  But then
     opens the cabinet and pulls out a glass, allowing Todd to continue.  

 TODD                     (with difficulty) 
             I try.  But it's...  different now.  I sit in 
             front of my books and start thinking about...
             about corpses, and electrified fences and
             people getting strangled with piano wire.  
             All that crap you tell me.  The next thing I
             know it's after midnight.  I sit in class 
             like a zombie, ...useless.  But that's not
             the half of it.  Check out the letter.  

     Dussander goes back to the table and picks up the envelope.  He
     opens it.

 DUSSANDER                     (reading letter) 
             'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden, this note is to
             suggest that we have a group conference 
             concerning Todd's first semester grades.  In
             light of his previous good work in this
             school, the sudden deterioration in his
             grades suggest a specific problem which
             should be addressed before his academic 
             advancement is jeopardized permanently.  Such
             a problem can often be solved by a frank and
             open discussion.  I am ready to work out a 
             time for us to meet.  In a case such as this,
             earlier is usually better.  Sincerely yours,
             Edward French.'  Who is this Edward French,
             the headmaster? 

 TODD              French?  Fuck no.  He's a stupid guidance
             counselor.

 DUSSANDER              Guidance counselor?  What is that? 

 TODD              He guides and he counsels.  You read the
             fucking note.  Do you realize I could have to
             go to summer school?  Me, in there with all
             those fuck-ups.  I do not want to go to
             summer school.  

 DUSSANDER              Or to the reformatory.  

 TODD              What did you say? 

 DUSSANDER              Boy, ...you have a far greater problem than
             your school grades.  Before you speak to me
             about what they will "get out of you", 
             remember the facts. ...Seventy thousand 
             people died at Patin.  Have you forgotten 
             that?  To the world at large I am the most 
             despicable of criminals, a monster.  Do you 
             think I would stand aside and let you turn me
             in so easily?  Without a fight?  Is your 
             American self-confidence so bloated that you 
             have never once realized you are an accessory 
             to my crimes.  You have criminal knowledge of 
             an illegal alien, and have not reported it. 
             Don't you see that?  And if I'm caught, I 
             will tell the world all about you.  When the 
             reporters put their microphones in my face it
             will be your name I'll repeat over and over
             again.  Todd Bowden, yes that's his name.  
             How long?... oh, for months, almost a year.
             He wanted to know everything...  That's how
             he put it, yes - everything.  

 TODD              They'd never believe you.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's a gamble.  How
             would you explain all those books you were
             reading to me?  My eyes are not what they 
             were but I can still read fine print.  I can
             prove it.

 TODD              So what? I'd say you tricked me.  

 DUSSANDER              Why would I do that?

 TODD              For friendship, because you're lonely and had
             no one in your life.  No jury would take your
             word over mine.  A Nazi?  Forget it.  Just 
             get it out of your head.  You can't threaten
             me and you can't scare me.  What you can do
             is find me a pencil.  

 DUSSANDER              A pencil, what for? 

     Todd sets the small paper bag on the table.  Dussander opens it
     and removes a small bottle.  The label reads: "ink eradicator."
     He also removes an x-acto knife and a few sheets of rub-off
     letters.  

 TODD              That will take care of the report card, I 
             think.  About that fucking letter, I don't
             know.  

     Todd sits down at the table.  He takes the bottle from Dussander
     and examines the report card.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Fuck...  come on, a pencil.  A sharp one.  
             With an eraser.  

     Dussander pauses.  He knows Todd is right.  Slowly, he goes to 
     the counter and opens a drawer.  He rummages through it as Todd 
     sits with his back to him.  Dussander picks out a pencil with an
     extremely sharp point.  He holds it point out and approaches
     Todd.  He gets closer, the point moves in toward the back of 
     Todd's head.  He holds the point inches from the boy's neck.  He
     deliberates.

 DUSSANDER              Will this do? 

     Todd grabs the pencil.  Dussander turns toward the window.  He
     thinks for a moment.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Tell me, does this French know your parents
             in a social way? 

 TODD              Him?  Fuck, no.  They wouldn't mix with a
             geek like him.  

 DUSSANDER              How about professionally?  Has he ever called
             them before? 

 TODD              No.  I've never needed it.  Why? 

 DUSSANDER              I have an idea.  It will require you to make
             one phone call.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY 
     Kurt Dussander, a.k.a. Arthur Denker, a.k.a. Victor Bowden,
     Todd's grandfather, sits outside an office marked, "Edward
     French - Guidance."  Dussander looks the best he has ever 
     looked.  His hair is clean and combed.  His face is shaved.  And
     he is smartly dressed in his best blue suit.  As he waits, he
     glances down at a piece of paper.  We see that it is a "crib-
     sheet" of Todd's family tree.  Several names appear on the 
     sheet, connected to other names by lines and arrows.  By each
     name is one or two word description, such as "dead: cancer,
     1981" or "divorced, Dallas, Tex."  The door opens up.  Dussander
     pockets the note.  EDWARD FRENCH, 40's, stands in the doorway.
     He wears a turtle neck under his sportcoat.  

 FRENCH              Mr. Bowden?

 DUSSANDER              Mr. French, a pleasure.  

     There is a bit of hesitation on French's part, but they shake 
     hands.  Dussander notices the shoes on French's feet, bright red
     converse high-tops.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              My, those are some... colorful shoes.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRENCH'S OFFICE - DAY 
     French makes his way around his desk.  Dussander stands by the
     door.

 FRENCH              To you, sir, I'm sure they seem quite out of 
             the ordinary.  But when it is your job to get 
             confused sixteen year-olds to open up to you,
             you take whatever steps you need.  Please
             have a seat.  

     They both sit.  

 DUSSANDER              And the shoes work? 

 FRENCH              They seem to help, believe it or not.  Well,
             I thank you for coming down, Mr.  Bowden, but
             I'll be frank with you...  

 DUSSANDER              Yes, please do.

 FRENCH              The fact that you're here and not Todd's
             parents tells me a great deal.  

 DUSSANDER              I'm sure.  My son and his wife asked me to 
             come in and discuss this sorry business with 
             you, Mr.  French.  Todd is a good boy, believe
             me.  This trouble with his grades is only
             temporary.  

     Dussander pulls out his cigarettes and then, thinking twice,
     puts them back.

 FRENCH              It's all right.
                    (pulls an ashtray from desk
                    drawer) 
             There's no smoking on school grounds, but if 
             it will make you more comfortable, I'll never
             tell.

 DUSSANDER              A terrible habit, but thank you.
                    (lights up) 
             I suppose I should begin by informing you 
             that my son and my daughter-in-law are having
             troubles at home.  Rather bad troubles, I
             should think.  

 FRENCH              I appreciate your candor.  

 DUSSANDER                     (leaning in)
             The mother drinks.

 FRENCH              Oh.  

 DUSSANDER              Yes.  The boy has told me that he has come
             home on two occasions and has found her 
             sprawled out on the kitchen table.  He knows 
             how my son feels about her drinking and so on
             these occasions he has put dinner in the oven
             himself and forced enough black coffee down 
             his mother's throat so that she will at least
             be awake when Richard gets home.

 FRENCH              That's bad.  Has Mrs. Bowden thought about
             getting professional help for her problem? 

 DUSSANDER              The boy has tried to persuade her, but she is
             far too ashamed, I think.  If she was given a
             little time...  You understand? 

 FRENCH              Of course.  Your son... Todd's father...

 DUSSANDER              He is not without blame, believe me.  The
             hours he works.  The meals he has missed.  
             They take a toll on a family.  I was raised
             to believe that a man's family came before 
             his work or anything else.  I tried to teach
             my son that... but --

 FRENCH              There's only so much we can teach our kids, 
             Mr. Bowden.  ...What about Monica's mother or
             father?  Couldn't they talk to her? 

 DUSSANDER              Her mother, Sabrina, lives in a nursing home
             in Florida.  I'm afraid after her husband
             died she lost her will to live.  

 FRENCH              Probably not the best person for Monica to
             speak to.  

 DUSSANDER              Indeed.  

 FRENCH              Mr. Bowden, I don't have to remind you, I'm 
             sure, of Todd's stellar academic record.
             National Merit Scholar finalist, Academic
             All-Stars.  

 DUSSANDER              Yes.  I keep his certificates on the wall of
             my store.  I run a small bookstore in San
             Remo.  

     A hint of skepticism crosses French's eyes.  

 FRENCH                     (glancing at folder on desk) 
             Yes, I see that.  Anyway, Todd is, and I hate
             to phrase it this way, but he's one of the 
             ones worth fighting for.  He's a special kid,
             we both know that.  But If Todd's grades
             don't improve drastically and quickly...
             he'll be opening a real nasty can of worms.
             Summer school would just be the beginning.  
             His whole college acceptance schedule would
             be thrown way off course.  The good schools
             won't know what to make of him.  I'm sure
             he'd hate that and so would you.

 DUSSANDER              Of course.  

 FRENCH              So let's get to the bottom line, shall we? 
             What I'm proposing is some family counselling
             at the Counselling Center downtown.
             Everything is in confidence, of course.  A
             man in charge down there, Harry Shumacher, is 
             a good friend of mine.  I think Todd and his 
             parents should go see him together.  It might
             be difficult for Todd to go to his parents 
             with this; I think you should do it.  Maybe
             we can get everybody on track by the end of 
             the next quarter.  It will be tough, but not
             impossible.  

 DUSSANDER              I'm not sure that would be the best thing for
             the boy.  The parents might resent him if I
             took them that proposal right now.  Things
             are very delicate.  To swing the scale too 
             far in the wrong direction might cause more 
             harm than good.  The boy has promised to work
             harder in his studies.  He is most concerned
             by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than
             you might expect.  He has his mind set on 
             attending Stanford or Berkeley next fall and
             does not wish to see his plans altered.  

 FRENCH              Yes, well -- 

 DUSSANDER              Also, the parents would resent me.  Monica
             already thinks I meddle too much in her
             affairs.  

 FRENCH              I have a great deal of experience in these 
             matters, Mr. Bowden.  And please understand
             that my interest in your son's marital 
             problems begins and ends with the effect they
             are having on Todd.  And right now I think 
             they are having quite an effect.  I really
             think counselling is in order here.  

 DUSSANDER              Allow me to make a counter proposal.  You 
             have, I believe, a system for warning parents
             of poor grades? 

 FRENCH              Yes, Interpretation of Progress cards.  IOP
             cards.  The kids call them flunk card.  They
             only get them when their grades in a class 
             fall below the seventy percent.  That means a
             "D" or an "F".  Why? 

 DUSSANDER              And they are sent out when? 

 FRENCH              Mid-quarter.  That's about three weeks into
             the new marking period.  

 DUSSANDER              Allowing for Christmas break, the next time
             they are sent out will be in late January,
             correct?

 FRENCH              Yes, that's right.  

 DUSSANDER              Good.  Then what I suggest is this...  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY 
     Dussander still wears the blue suit.  The tie has been loosened
     and top button undone.  Todd still wears his backpack.

 TODD              You what? 

 DUSSANDER              I told him you were getting back on track by
             your own accord.  I gave him my word.  If you
             get even one flunk card--

 TODD              Are you out of your fucking mind?  I'm going
             to get three or four flunk cards.  I failed
             an economics test today, so there's another
             one. 

 DUSSANDER              Boy, it was the best I could do without
             arousing suspicion.  

 TODD              I could have done better myself --

 DUSSANDER              Well you didn't, did you?  This is the way it
             is and now you are upset because the only way
             you can make things right is to work.

 TODD              You're insane.  I'm upset because it can't be done.  

 DUSSANDER              It can.  And it will.  You will work.  

 TODD              I don't take orders from you.  Maybe you've
             forgotten --

 DUSSANDER                     (turning on him) 
             Listen, boy.  Before today it was possible,
             just barely possible, that you could have
             denounced me and come out clean yourself.  
             The way your nerves have been lately I don't
             think so, but never mind that.  It was - at
             least technically possible.  But now things
             have changed.  Today I impersonated your 
             grandfather, one Victor Bowden.  And it was
             you who arranged the meeting.  What would
             people make of that?  If things come out 
             now... perhaps you were right, your age and a
             good attorney might keep you out of jail, but
             you would be humiliated, boy, publicly.  You 
             would be infamous.  Your parents too.  Do you 
             know what such a scandal would do to them?
             To you?  Think about that.  

     Todd is stunned.  He turns away, then back again, struggling for
     the right words.  

 TODD              You fucker.  

 DUSSANDER              It's a done deal, boy.  If you don't like it,
             you can discuss it at family counselling.  

 TODD              God!  I wish... I wish -- 

 DUSSANDER              Never mind your wishes.  Your wishes make me
             sick.  All I want to hear is that you
             understand the situation.  

     Todd is furious.  He sees there is no other way, but continues
     fighting.

 TODD              Look, you gotta believe me.  There is no way
             in hell that I can pull myself out of a half
             year slide in a couple of weeks.  I wish I 
             could, but we're just going to have to think
             of something else.  

 DUSSANDER              Boy, the time for discussion is over.  This
             is the way it is.  You are going to work.
             And I am going to be right here with you.  

 TODD              What are you talking about? 


 EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY 
     Todd is standing with his bike on a dirt path.  He is looking
     out at something.  The wind blows throw his hair.  A distant
     glimpse of some buildings off to the side tell us he is on a
     hill.  

 DUSSANDER (V.O.)              You are going to spend the rest of this 
             quarter, all of your vacation and the first 
             three weeks of January studying.  During your
             free period you will study.  During lunch,
             you will study.  And after school and on 
             weekends you will come here and do the same.


 EXT. BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DAY 
     Todd pedals his bike furiously toward the camera.  He approaches
     a tunnel lined with corrugated metal below an overpass.

 TODD (V.O.)              Not here, at home.  

 DUSSANDER (V.O.)              No.  At home you will dawdle, you will talk
             on the telephone, watch TV.  Here, I can make
             sure that nothing distracts you from your
             studies.

     Todd emerges from the tunnel.  


     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #3: EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT

     Spotlights, like those from a guard tower, criss cross over a 
     small compound surrounded by an electrified fence.  Inside the 
     pen, wolf-like dogs snarl and gnash their teeth.  The spotlight
     catches the source of their aggravation...  

     Dussander, caught ghoulishly in the roving light, stands in 
     uniform outside the pen.  He is laughing.  In his hand is his
     Luger.  He fires through the fence, killing one of the dogs.
     They go wild.  He laughs harder.  He shoots again, and then
     again.  It is like shooting fish in a barrel.  

     The light beam passes the pen to reveal that the dogs have 
     transformed into human prisoners.  They maneuver helplessly to
     avoid Dussander's bullets.  But he fires faster, his laugh 
     growing more extreme.  His movements in between shots becomes a 
     sort of dance.  One prisoner flies against the fence in a pools
     of sparks.  As Dussander's waltz reaches it's climax, one 
     prisoner remains in the pen.  He looks up.  It is Todd.  Angle
     on Dussander's toothy grin.  The gun comes up...  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
     Dussander wakes up.  A CLANKING SOUND echoes from the street.
     Dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex 
     dream, but he turns his head toward the direction of the street.
     He clicks on the light.  Dressed in the SS uniform, he gets up
     and moves toward the window.  

     Through the window, bathed in the glow of a street lamp, a
     derelict, who we will come to know as ARCHIE, rummages through
     Dussander's trashcans.  Under his arm are a few of the empty 
     bourbon bottles.  


 INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - NIGHT 
     The car pulls into the driveway of Todd's house.  Becky is
     smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window.  They both
     look a little tipsy, as if they have been to a party.  She holds 
     the joint up to Todd.  He contemplates, then takes it.  Todd's
     first toke of marijuana isn't very small.  Becky looks on, 
     surprised.  She reaches out for the joint and Todd waves her 
     off.  He pulls again, this time ingesting a huge hit.  He holds 
     it, then exhales.  He gives the roach back to Becky.

 TODD              Their light is still on.  I'll get out on
             your side.  Don't say anything.

     Becky gets out.  Todd slides over and does the same.  She 
     crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her
     purse.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Dussander watches Archie collect the cans and bottles.  There is
     something about Archie that makes Dussander wonder if he has
     seen him before.  Archie looks up, right into Dussander's 
     window, as if he were expecting him to be there.  The two stare
     at one another for a long moment.  Suddenly Dussander is aware
     that he is dressed in the SS uniform.  

     He quickly steps back from the window.  His breathing is short 
     and erratic as he waits in the shadows for Archie to finish.  
     After a long moment, the noise from the street stops.  We hear
     only the faint steps of Archie walking away.  


 INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT 
     Todd and Becky's lips are locked in a passionate kiss. In their
     exuberance they fall onto the bed.  As they try to undress and
     kiss at the same time, Becky begins to moan.  Todd brings his
     fingers to his lips.  

 TODD              Shhh.  

     Their clothes tumble off around them.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Don't move.  

     He slides off her and opens the drawer by his bed.  He pulls out
     a condom.  By now she is naked.  Todd slips out of his underwear
     and falls on top of her.  The RADIO plays in the b.g. as Todd
     begins to grind away with his hips.  She moans softly with 
     delight.

     The CAMERA MOVES off of them to reveal a man in a lab coat 
     setting up a volt meter.  This is one of the scientists from 
     Todd's laboratory nightmare.  The CAMERA continues TO PAN across
     the bedroom, showing the other scientists preparing for the 
     electricity experiment.  The CAMERA STOPS on Dussander,
     clipboard in hand, observing everything carefully.  

     Todd releases with a final thrust.  Becky is MOANING in a series
     of high, fast yelps.  Todd lies still on her body.  Becky is
     speechless, still quivering from the unusually intense love
     making.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     The bedroom is dark except for the glowing tip of a cigarette.
     Dussander is in bed, wide awake...  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
 TITLE: JANUARY 1985 
     Todd sits alone at the table, eating while he studies.  
     Dussander crosses the frame behind him, drink in hand.  Todd is
     noticeably annoyed by Dussander's presence.


 EXT. BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DUSK 
     It is raining.  Todd is riding fast.  He wears a raincoat with 
     the hood up.  He talks to himself loudly, but we can't make out
     what he is saying.  He enters the tunnel.  

     The muddy run-off inside the tunnel catches Todd by surprise.
     He loses control of the bike and falls into the mud.  

 TODD              Fuck.  

     Todd gets up and tries to free his bike, but the mud and water
     do not make the job easy.  He is almost finished when a gruff
     voice catches his attention.  

 ARCHIE (O.S.)              Hey, kid, you having some trouble? 

     Todd looks up and sees a figure moving toward him in the shadows
     of the tunnel. Todd quickly pulls out a pocket knife.  He flicks
     open the blade and hides it behind his leg.  

 TODD              No.  I got it... thanks.  

     The figure steps closer.  The light catches his face to reveal
     Archie.  He is an unshaven, filthy mess, and when he speaks his
     words are slurred from years of steady drinking.  

 ARCHIE              That case maybe you could loan me a dollar.
             Help out a Vietnam vet? How 'bout it? 

     Todd eyes the man cautiously.  He looks around.  No one is 
     nearby.  The constant din of the rain echoes within the confines
     of the tunnel.  

 TODD              I... I don't know... I don't think so.  

     Todd palms the knife out of sight and slowly approaches the bum.  

 ARCHIE              C'mon, you got something for me.  I know you
             do.

 TODD              Well, maybe... I have to check.  

     Todd's hands go into his pockets.  He stops a few feet from the
     bum.  

 ARCHIE              See, I got to get up to L.A.  Got a job
             waiting for me up there.  

     Todd moves closer.  Close enough to touch the bum.  

 TODD              I thought I did have a couple of quarters...

     The bum looks at him hopefully. Todd looks back at him, sizing
     him up, really noticing him for the first time.  

 ARCHIE              You know, 
                    (his voice drops) 
             For a dollar I'll give you a blow job.  Take 
             you right up there where it's still dry.  You
             never had so good, kid.  You'll come your
             brains out.  

     Todd freezes for a moment.  The bum is right in his face.  
     Suddenly Todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints
     back to his bike.  He hops on and is gone in a flash, leaving
     the bum there to pick up the scattered coins.  

     As Todd zips away, the hood is off his head.  The rain begins to
     beat away the splattered mud from his face.


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY 
     Mr. Proxmire makes his way through the rows of desks.  He is
     passing out papers.  

 PROXMIRE              Our illustrious administration, in its quest
             to make my job as difficult as possible, has
             decided that home room teachers are now 
             responsible for handing IOP cards for all 
             your classes.  So for those of you getting
             flunk cards, you'll find them attached to
             last week's exam.  

     Moans erupt from the class.  Todd sits motionless at his desk.
     The moment of truth.  Proxmire passes him and places the exam
     face down on Todd's desk.  Todd hesitates before turning it
     over.  He is sweating.  

     He flips the paper over and glares at the small card clipped to
     the top of the paper.  He picks up the card and reads it: "I'm
     sure glad I didn't have to give you one of these for real!
     Great improvement, Todd. -- Anne Leland."  Todd cannot contain 
     his delight.  Nearby students stare curiously at the strange boy
     beaming over his flunk card.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     Dussander sits at the table.  He holds the IOP card out at arm's
     length to read it.  The bourbon bottle next to him is empty.
     Todd sits across from him.  

 DUSSANDER              Well, this calls for a celebration, no? 

     Dussander gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  

 TODD              Look, I guess I owe a lot of this to you.
             I'm not proud of it, but it's true.  

 DUSSANDER                     (eyeing him cautiously)
             Your gratitude humbles me.
                    (pause) 
             How about some Ritz crackers and Velveeta?

 TODD              Sure, what the hell.  

     Dussander goes about his task, taking items from the cabinets, 
     etc.  Todd watches all of this intently, but without expression.  

 DUSSANDER              I would have expected you to be doing back 
             flips down the hallway after such good news.
             You are so quiet.  

     Todd does not respond.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Today, I think, I give you the day off from
             studying.  How's that?  How about one of my
             stories instead?  I still have a few good
             ones saved up.  

 TODD              I don't care.  Whatever you want.  

     Todd is wringing his hand together nervously under the table.
     Dussander places a box of crackers on the table and goes back to
     the counter.

 DUSSANDER              Let's see.  I could tell you about the 
             special soap we made.  Or there is always the
             story of how I escaped from Berlin after I
             was foolish enough to go back.  That was a
             close one, I promise you.  

 TODD              Anything, really.  

 DUSSANDER              No, none of these I think.  You don't seem to
             be in the mood.  

     Dussander slices open a pack of Velveeta and puts it on a plate.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              I think today I will tell you the story of an
             old man who was afraid.  He was afraid of a
             certain young boy who was, in a queer way, 
             his friend.  The boy proved to be a very good
             student, but perhaps not in the way his 
             mother or his teachers had envisioned.  At 
             first the old man disliked the boy intensely,
             but then he grew to... to enjoy the boy's 
             company.  Of course, there was still a great
             deal of distrust between them.

     He puts a glass of Coke in front of Todd and goes back to the
     counter.  He opens a drawer, takes something out, closes it.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Each knew something that other wanted to keep
             secret.  But over time, the old man began to
             feel that things were changing.  He felt his
             hold on the boy slipping away from him.  

     Dussander goes to the cellar door.  His back is to Todd.  He
     opens the door and clicks on the light.  Todd stands up
     silently.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              So.  One sleepless night the old man got out
             of bed and wrote down the story of his 
             involvement with the boy.  Everything he 
             could remember, from the first day forward.  

     Todd has moved across the floor, careful not to let the floor 
     creak under his steps.  He is right upon Dussander.  Dussander
     reaches out with one arm for a fresh bottle, grasping onto the
     railing with the other.  His body hangs over the steep
     staircase.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              When he finished his hand was stinging from 
             arthritis but he felt good for the first time
             in weeks.  He felt safe.

     He gets his balance again and turns to face Todd.  Dussander
     holds the kitchen knife he was using earlier down at his side 
     where Todd can see it.  A tense silence passes between them.

     Todd is frozen.  Dussander steps past him and back into the 
     kitchen.  He closes the cellar door behind him. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              He climbed back into bed and slept until it
             was time for General Hospital.  

     Dussander sits back in his chair, cutting the seal on the fresh
     bottle. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              On the following day the old man put on his
             best suit and went down to one of the local
             banks and rented a safety deposit box.  The 
             bank officer explained to the old man that he
             would have a key and the bank would have a
             key.  To open the box both keys would be 
             needed.  No one but the old man could use the
             old man's key without a signed, notarized
             letter of permission from the old man 
             himself.  With one exception.

     Todd sinks into a chair across from Dussander and takes a sip of
     Coke.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              That exception is made in the event of the
             box-holder's death.  

 TODD              Then what? 

 DUSSANDER              Then the box is opened in the presence of a
             bank official and a representative of the 
             Internal Revenue Service.  The contents of 
             the box are inventoried.  In this case they 
             will find only a twelve-page document.  Non-
             taxable... but highly interesting.  

     Todd understands what the old man has told him.  He slams his
     glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair.  

 TODD              You can't... you can't do that.  

 DUSSANDER              My boy, it is already done.  

 TODD              But... Christ!  Look at you.  You could go at
             any time.  

     Todd stares at Dussander in disbelief.  After a moment he storms
     out the back door to the porch.  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY 
     Todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when
     Dussander steps onto the porch.  He carries with him the bottle
     of bourbon and a glass.  

 TODD              Then there is nothing for me.  

 DUSSANDER              But there is.  As the years go by, as I get
             closer to the grave, your hold on me will 
             become worth less and less.  A man five, ten
             years older than I worries more about his 
             ailing heart than being extradited to Israel.
             And there will come a day - if I live long
             enough - when I decide what you know no 
             longer matters.  Then, and only then, I will
             destroy my document.  

 TODD              But... but so many things can happen to you 
             in between.  Accidents.  Sickness.  You could
             slip in the shower, for Christ's sake...  

     Dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette.  He begins to
     sing softly, then gets caught up in the song...  Todd turns away, angry.

 DUSSANDER              Que sera, sera...  Whatever will be, will
             be... The future's not ours to see... Que
             sera, sera...  

     Pause.  Dussander sees he has pressed Todd's button.  He moves
     closer.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              My dear boy, I see you thinking about it, 
             even now.  It is in your eyes.  Killing me.
             It would take only a flick of a knife.  Or
             maybe push me down the steps, make it look 
             like an accident?  I am old.  You are strong.
             You are angry.  Good assets for killing.  But
             there is something missing...  

     Dussander speaks with a near whisper in Todd's ear.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              To have some one in your control.  To have
             them know that they are alive because you
             have not decided to the contrary.  Do you
             have that power?  Ask yourself.  It is no
             easy question.  I think you know that.  

     There is a long pregnant pause.  Then Todd lets out a sigh, as if
     to dismiss what he has just heard.  He turns to face Dussander.  

 TODD              You know this means we're through.  You won't
             be seeing me around here anymore.  

 DUSSANDER              No, I suppose I won't.  

 TODD              I'm never coming here again.  

 DUSSANDER              And so it comes to an end.  Here.

     Dussander pours a splash of bourbon into the boy's glass.  

 TODD              What are you doing? 

 DUSSANDER              A drink.  To our lives together, the
             beginning... and the end.  

     Todd picks up his glass.  

 TODD              I think you should fuck yourself.  

     He CLICKS his glass against Dussander's.

 DUSSANDER              My boy, don't you see that we are fucking
             each other? 

     He drinks.  Todd, reluctantly, does the same.

 FADE TO BLACK. 

 EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY 
 TITLE: APRIL 1985 
     Dussander, dressed smartly for a day out of the house, emerges
     from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the 
     sidewalk, the umbrella under his arm.  He stops at an empty bench 
     and sits to wait for the bus.  

     Archie sits down next to him.  At first Dussander doesn't pay
     attention to him, but Archie's behavior tells us that he is 
     keenly aware of Dussander's presence.  Dussander stares out into
     the street, but Archie fidgets about, his eyes roaming, and 
     finally slides a little closer to Dussander.  Dussander looks at
     him flatly.  Archie grins.  Dussander turns away, prepared to
     dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict.  Then
     Archie speaks...

 ARCHIE                     (leaning over) 
             I notice the kid don't come around no more.  

     Dussander doesn't respond.  He catches Archie in a glance and
     sees that he is staring at him.  

 DUSSANDER              What?

 ARCHIE              Little blond-hair boy. ...What's the matter,
             you ain't his friend no more? 

     Dussander is like stone, flashing the eyes of a man who is not
     to be harassed.  Finally...  

 DUSSANDER              You mistake me for somebody else. ...Pardon
             me, my bus is coming.  

     Dussander stands, slightly rattled only to those who know him
     well.  He looks down the street for the bus.  Archie doesn't 
     move.  Rather, he inspects Dussander from head to toe, stopping
     on the shoes.  

 ARCHIE              Damn... Cuban high heels.  Nice ones, too. 

     The SQUEAL of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in 
     front of Dussander.  He has become perceptibly more nervous as
     he waits for the passengers to exit.  He climbs up the first
     step.

 ARCHIE              I ain't seen a pair like that since I was in
             Havana.  
                    (talking louder because of the 
                    bus) 
             That's the only place you can get'em.  Can't
             get'em exported... Government don't let you.  

     The door closes behind Dussander. The bus pulls away. Through
     the window of the bus Dussander watches Archie as he continues
     his speech to no one.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 
 TITLE: MAY 1985 
     Todd sits nervously in a chair next to a tough, leather-clad 
     trouble maker.  A SECRETARY sits behind a long desk.  Her phone
     beeps and she picks it up.  

 SECRETARY              Go in, Todd.  They're waiting for you.  

     Todd approaches a door marked: "Dr. Carl N. Morgan - Principal."
     He goes in.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY 
     Todd opens the office door.  As his eyes scan the floor he
     notices a familiar pair of yellow high-tops.  He looks up to see
     Ed French leaning against the wall.  Seated at the desk is
     MORGAN, a thin, stern man, around 50.  Todd's face shows a
     moment of trepidation, but he regains his composure almost
     instantly.

 MORGAN              Have a seat, Todd.  

     Todd does as Morgan pours over Todd's files.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              I see from your record and from what Mr.  
             French tells me that after a minor slip up
             last semester you're right back on course.
             Straight A's for the quarter so far.  And I 
             hear your little slip didn't bother the folks
             up at Stanford too much either.  

 FRENCH              A good break for you, Todd.  

 MORGAN              Looks like that little talk with your...
                    (looks at file) 
             grandfather... really helped.  Well, we don't
             want to keep you too long.  
                    (to French)
             You tell him.  

 FRENCH              Well, it seems Sally Chong didn't do to well
             in A.P. biology.

 MORGAN              She failed it.  

 FRENCH              I'm afraid so.  She refused to take part in 
             the fetal pig dissection.  The teacher begged
             her to drop the class, but Sally thought she
             could pass anyway.  

 MORGAN              Stubborn girl... What we're telling you, son,
             is that because Sally Chang -

 FRENCH              Chong.  

 MORGAN              Because Sally Chong wouldn't hack up a baby 
             pig, you snuck by her in the rankings.  So if
             you can keep your grades up for two more
             months -- any reason that shouldn't happen? 

 TODD              No.  

 MORGAN              Then you'll make valedictorian, Todd.
             Congratulations.  

 FRENCH              Congratulations, Todd.  

     French shakes Todd's hand, an uneasy moment passes between the
     two of them.


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 
     Todd comes out of Morgan's office.  French follows him.  

 FRENCH              Todd, you really should be proud of yourself.
             To tell you the truth, I'm amazed you pulled 
             it off.  

 TODD              Thanks, I guess.  

     He starts to walk away.  

 FRENCH              I was glad to hear you made varsity baseball.
             I spoke to the coach.  He says your coming
             along real well.  

 TODD              Thanks.  

 FRENCH              It's turning out to be a good year for you.  

 TODD              Yeah.  

     He turns to go, but French stops him again.  

 FRENCH              Todd, wait.  

     He steps up to Todd and lowers his voice, as if he were hedging
     a touchy subject.

 FRENCH (CONT'D)              Todd, you've got a lot of good things going
             on right now.  You should be enjoying
             yourself.  

 TODD              I am.  

     French's looks says, "No, you're not." 

 FRENCH              How are things at home? 

     Todd realizes he is not going to get out of this easily.  

 TODD              Look, things with my parents were bad for a
             while.  But they're doing a lot better.  
             Thanks for your concern, really.  I should
             get back to class.  

     He is pulling away from French as he speaks.  

 FRENCH                     (unconvinced) 
             Okay, Todd.  I know this isn't the place to
             talk about this.  But my door is always open...

 TODD              I know.  Thanks.  

     Todd walks away.  

 FRENCH              And it's going to stay open.  

     But Todd does not turn around.  French stares after him.  The
     BELL RINGS, and Todd is swallowed by the stream of students
     emerging from the class rooms.  


 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
     Todd is kneeling down at the bike rack.  His backpack is on the
     ground next to him.  He unlocks his bike and begins to coil the
     chain around his wrist when Joey walks by.  He sees Todd and
     considers going by, but stops.  We can tell they haven't spoken
     in a while.  

 JOEY              Hey there.  

     Todd looks up.  He seems pleasant, but there is little warmth in
     his voice.  

 TODD              Hey.  

     Pause.  They look at each other.  Joey wants to talk.  Todd
     slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack.  Joey
     jingles his car keys anxiously.  

 JOEY              I... ah, I heard about Stanford.  I heard a
             couple of weeks ago actually. ...Congrats.  

 TODD              Thanks.  

 JOEY              I got into school to.  Long Beach.  It's no
             Stanford, but...  

     Joey shrugs.  It's an awkward moment.  He walks closer.  

 TODD              No, no... that's good, Joe.  

 JOEY              Well, ...I just wanted to say hi.  Here let
             me get that.  

     Joey reaches for Todd's backpack.  He lifts it.  The heaviness
     puzzles him.  Todd takes it from him.  

 JOEY (CONT'D)              What do you have in there? 

     Todd stares at him stone-faced.  Joey doesn't like Todd's
     expression.  Todd takes the bag from him and puts it on.  

 TODD              You busy now? 

 JOEY              Uhh...  

 TODD              Come with me.  Hop on.  

 JOEY              Hop on?  I have a car now, Todd.  

 TODD              You can't drive where we're going.  


 EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY 
     Joey sits on the handle bars as Todd pedals over the rugged
     terrain.  Joy looks scared, but appears to be enjoying the ride 
     and the chance to be with his old friend.  

     The next shot shows Todd's bike laying on the ground.  The
     wheels still turn slowly.  The camera moves to reveal Todd and
     Joey standing on a rocky ledge.  Orange Country sprawls out
     before them.  

     Under the cross-hairs of a telescopic sight, a truck, from the
     freeway below, zooms out of frame.  The image vanishes.  We see
     Joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand.  

 JOEY              This is so cool.  

 TODD              Point it over here.  That's the middle 
             school.  You can see right into our old class
             room.  

 JOEY              Oh yeah... But I still don't see what you 
             need the rest of it for.  Doesn't your Dad
             notice? 

     The hunting rifle, disassembled, sticks out of Todd's backpack
     on the ground.  

 TODD              He hasn't yet.  

 JOEY              Yet?... Jesus, Todd.  

     He is trying to joke, but the seriousness is clearly in his
     voice.  

 TODD              And over here, that's your dad's office.  And
             there's the old drive-in.  

     Joey isn't looking through the scope anymore.  He holds it out
     to Todd, watching him.  

 JOEY              Here.  Take it.  

     Todd grabs the scope.  But Joey doesn't let go.  He finally
     locks Todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months.  He
     wants to say something.  Todd takes the scope.  He sees that 
     Joey is serious.  He takes a few steps toward the edge, toward
     the gun.  He looks out.  

 TODD              It's such a rush, you know?... To be up here.
             Don't you feel it?  So high above them they
             never know we're here.  It's like an ant 
             farm.  We're the gods on Mt. Olympus, Joey.
             They can't see us, they can't hear us, but
             every so often we can make them feel us.
             Just so they never forget.  Look...  

     He looks through the scope at the freeway.  He picks out passing
     cars.

 TODD (CONT'D)              There goes a future track star.  There goes a
             judge.  A mom and her two kids.  A policeman.
             That one's a school teacher, that one's a
             drug dealer... You see, Joey, it doesn't 
             matter.  It doesn't matter how smart you are
             ...or how many grades you skip.  There's 
             always someone who can take it all away.  The
             right person snaps their fingers... and it's
             done.  

     Joey takes a few steps backward.  Todd doesn't notice.

 JOEY              Todd, I'm gonna go.  I'm gonna... walk home.  

     Todd turns his head toward Joey, but it is as though no one is 
     there.  He looks away again.

 JOEY (CONT'D)              Todd...

     Pause.  Todd looks again.  But this time Joey is really gone.  A
     slight chuckle escapes Todd's mouth.  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S STREET - EVENING 
 TITLE: JUNE 1985 
     Dussander plods down the sidewalk with his sacks of groceries.  
     He is a little more winded, moves a little slower than
     previously.

     Suddenly Archie emerges from behind a group of trees.  He moves
     quickly up to Dussander, catching him off guard.  

 ARCHIE              I can do that.  I can help you carry those.  

     Dussander jumps back.  Archie stops.  

 ARCHIE (CONT'D)              You don't gotta be afraid.  I can carry those.

     Dussander does not move.  But slowly his face changes and we
     realize that he remembers Archie from the bus stop.  

 DUSSANDER              I don't need any help. ...Excuse me.  

     He starts off again.  Archie follows.  

 ARCHIE              Hey, I ain't a bad guy.  You don't gotta
             worry.  I'm a veteran.  I just want--

 DUSSANDER                     (snapping at him) 
             What?  What do you want?  Why do you bother me? 

     Archie is taken aback by the sudden viciousness.  

 ARCHIE                     (plaintively)
             You got a nice face.  

 DUSSANDER              No I don't.  

 ARCHIE              Look, we're practically neighbors.  I stay
             right over there most nights.  
                    (pointing across the street) 
             I see you walking down the street.  I come up
             to help.  It's called being neighborly.

     They are nearing Dussander's yard.  

 DUSSANDER              Piss off.  

     Fed up with his belligerence, Archie strips the bags from
     Dussander's hands with ease.  Dussander knows he is outmatched.  

 ARCHIE              Ain't no reason to be rude.  You see, I know
             something about you. ...I know your a nice
             guy.  I'm nice too, ...just like the kid.  

     Dussander looks up and down the street.  No one is around.

 DUSSANDER              I see.  

 ARCHIE              And I know you got some bourbon in these 
             bags.  I ain't ashamed to say I could use a 
             drink about now.  But I don't need no charity.
             If you want to invite me in, like a friend,
             we could have a nice drink.  

 DUSSANDER              A drink.  

 ARCHIE              That's what I'm saying.  

     Long pause.  

 DUSSANDER              You smell like a toilet.  

 ARCHIE              Maybe you let me use your shower.  But first 
             a drink.  After that I'll do anything you say.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
     Dussander and Archie come through the front door.  Archie scans
     the room.

 ARCHIE              Yeah, this is nice.  Real nice.  

 DUSSANDER              Let me take those.  
                    (takes the bags)
             Right this way.  

     Dussander moves toward the kitchen.  Archie watches him walk
     away.  A smile crosses his face as he follows him to the kitchen.


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - EVENING 
     Todd and his parents are together in the living room.  Todd is
     studying for his trigonometry final.  Monica sits at the couch
     addressing graduation announcements.  Dick is at his desk,
     pouring over a pile of receipts.  

 MONICA              I guess your parents don't need a graduation 
             announcement.

 DICK              No.  

 TODD              Grandma and Grandpa aren't coming?

 MONICA                     (to Dick) 
             I thought you told him.  

 DICK              Christ, I forgot.  Todd, my aunt Patty, Dad's
             sister, died on Wednesday.  Mom and Dad have
             to drive up to Fresno to settle her estate.  
             We can't ask Dad to drive six hours each way
             for graduation.  

 MONICA              If we ask them, they'll do it.  

 DICK              That's why.  You understand, don't you, Todd? 

     Todd thinks for a moment, realizes something.  

 TODD              Of course, Dad.  It's all right.  Tell
             Grandpa I'll spend the week with him and
             Grandma when they get back.

 MONICA              What about Mr. Denker?  I almost forgot about
             him.  

 TODD              No, He won't want to come.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN & BASEMENT - EVENING 
     Archie, seated at the table with his back to Dussander, is in
     the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which
     Dussander half-listens.  Dussander goes to the cabinets and 
     takes out two glasses.  He pours the drinks and sets the glasses
     on the table.  Archie picks his up and is about to drink.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Ah-ah.  

     Dussander picks up his glass to toast Archie.  Archie CLINKS his
     glass to Dussander's and downs the shot.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              I believe we need another bottle, my friend.  

 ARCHIE              Well if you're offering, I'm accepting.  

     Dussander goes to the cellar door to retrieve another bottle.  

 DUSSANDER              No trouble at all.  Now where is my bottle
             opener?  Ah, here it is.  

     Dussander pulls something out of a drawer.  He goes to the table
     and stands right behind Archie.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Why don't you drink mine? 

     Archie picks up the glass and begins to drink, slower this time.
     Dussander pulls Archie's tattered hat off his head and sets it
     on the table.  He then begins to stroke the matted knots of
     Archie's hair.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              You don't mind do you? 

 ARCHIE              No. I don't mind. ...Maybe in the morning - 
             everything goes okay - you could let me have
             ten dollars.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps.  

 ARCHIE              Maybe even twenty.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps.  We shall see.  

     Pause.  

 ARCHIE              You can relax, you know, I've done this before.  

 DUSSANDER              It's all right.  So have I.  

     Dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of Archie's neck.  
     He starts to plunge it in just as Archie turns back to look at
     him.  The fork goes in crooked.  Archie explodes from the chair,
     HOWLING, his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear.  With
     the fork protruding from his back, Archie tosses the table to 
     the side.  The empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor
     and shatters.  Archie spins and slams a fist into Dussander's 
     temple.  Dussander collapses against the counter.  Archie moves
     about wildly, trying to grab the fork and pummel Dussander at
     the same time.  Blood is streaming freely from his wound.  

     Dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the
     counter.  As Archie approaches, Dussander swings the pan into
     Archie's descending fist.  Archie winces and staggers backward.
     He stomps down on the broken bottle and screams.  His guard
     falls briefly.  Dussander is upon him.  He swings the pan,
     catching Archie squarely in the face.  

     Archie brings his hands up to his face, which now oozes with
     blood.  Blinded by the blow, Archie charges Dussander, who 
     crouches to the side, and as Archie passes, hurls himself into
     the man's back, sending him through the open door of the cellar.
     Archie flies down the stairs face-first, tumbling into the 
     packed dirt floor like a derailed train.  Dussander, exhausted 
     and bloodied, exhales deeply.  Looking down at the crumpled body
     below, he straightens his tie, brushes the hair from his face,
     and then surveys the kitchen.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              What a mess.  

     He rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the 
     steps to finish the bum for good.  After about three steps he
     stops abruptly.  He appears puzzled, but after a moment the
     expression changes.  A look of searing pain rushes across his 
     face.  Dussander brings his hand to his chest.  He collapses on
     the stairs.  He is having a heart attack and knows it.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Oh my God.  

     He looks down at Archie, up to the kitchen, then back down to
     the cellar.  A moment of decision.  

     The stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they
     did a minute ago.  Getting to his feet, he turns slowly toward
     the kitchen.  He starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace,
     counting with each step.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Ein... Zwei... Drei...  


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER 
     The same scene as before.

 DICK              Monica... how long did we rent those jet skis
             in Hawaii? 

 MONICA              About two hours.  Why? 

 DICK              This receipt says we had two jet skis for
             twenty-three hours a piece.  The bill is 
             fifteen hundred dollars.  Didn't you look at
             the receipt before you signed it? 

     Todd doesn't look up from his textbook.  

 TODD              Way to go, Mom.  

 MONICA              That bill was written in Japanese.  I told
             you that.  

 DICK              Numbers are numbers, Monica, in any language.

 MONICA              That guy didn't speak a word of English.  I
             told you not to rent from him.  

     The PHONE RINGS.  Monica gets up to get it.  

 MONICA (CONT'D)              I'll get it.  

 DICK              That's not the point.  You should always read
             the bill before you sign.  I've told you that
             a hundred times.
                    (to Todd) 
             Fifteen hundred dollars.  

 TODD              Maybe it's in yen.  

     Pause.  Dick looks at the bill.  

 DICK              Hey, maybe you're right.  

     Monica comes back into the room.  

 MONICA              Todd, it's Mr.  Denker.  He sounds excited 
             about something.  You better speak to him.  

     Todd rises from the couch.  His mood shifts instantly.

 TODD                     (into phone) 
             Mr. Denker? 

     INTERCUT: between Todd in his living room and...  



 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander leaning against a wall in his blood-stained kitchen.
     The wall above Dussander read 6:50.  

 DUSSANDER              Come over right away, boy.  I'm having a
             heart attack, a bad one, I think.  

 TODD              Gee, that sounds exciting, Mr. Denker, but I
             was studying for my trig final -- 

 DUSSANDER              I understand that you cannot talk, but you
             can listen.  I cannot call 911...  at least 
             not yet.  There is quite a mess here.  I need
             help... and that means you need help.  

 TODD              Well if you put it that way -- 

 DUSSANDER              Tell your parents I've had a letter, an 
             important letter, and I need you to read it
             to me.

 TODD              Yeah, sure.  I'll be right there.  

 DUSSANDER              Now we see what you are made of, boy.  

     Dussander hangs up the phone and falls into a chair.  


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT 
 TODD              Bye.  
                    (hangs up) 
             I've got to run over to Mr. Denker's for a 
             minute.

 MONICA              Is everything all right? 

 TODD              Oh, he just got a letter from a nephew in 
             Hamburg or Dusseldorf or one of those places.  

 DICK              I thought his family was killed in the war.  

     Todd zips up his jacket.  

 TODD              So did he.  That's why he sounded excited.  I
             shouldn't be too long.  I'll take your car,
             Mom? 

 MONICA              I don't know, you have a final tomorrow.  

 TODD              I know, I was almost finished studying anyway.  

 DICK              Don't be gone too long, Todd.  

 TODD              See you in a bit.  

     He kisses Monica on the cheek.  He is out the front door.


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT 
     Todd's driving reflects his state of mind: erratic and out of
     control.  He meets a police car at an intersection and almost 
     runs a red light.  The police car doesn't bother him, however,
     and a moment later he pulls the Honda up to Dussander's house.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd appears in the door of the kitchen.  His face tells us that
     what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected.  The
     room is a gruesome sight.  Blood and broken glass are 
     everywhere.  The table has been knocked to the side.  Dussander,
     barely conscious, slumps in a chair.  

 TODD              What the fuck...? 

     Todd moves to the center of the room, careful not to step in any
     blood.  He doesn't know what to do.  His attention falls on
     Dussander.  Suddenly he rushes to him and begins to inspect his
     body carefully.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Where are you bleeding?... wake up.

     Dussander does not respond.  Todd shakes him harder.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Wake up, goddamnit! 

     Dussander stirs a little, aggravated.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              I thought you said you had a fucking heart attack.  

 DUSSANDER              It's not my blood, for Christ's sake.  

     Pause.  

 TODD              What did you say? 

 DUSSANDER              It was self-defense, boy.  Go downstairs.
             You'll see what needs to be done.  

     Dussander points to the open cellar door.  

 TODD              Fuck you.  I'm not going down there.  What
             happened?  What did you do? 

     Dussander only stares back at him, then looks away, almost 
     smiling through his incredible pain, as if to challenge Todd.

 TODD (CONT'D)              What the hell is this? 

     Dussander does not respond.  Todd stares at him for a moment,
     then moves toward the cellar.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Todd is half-way down the stairs when he freezes.  Sprawled out
     on the ground below him is Archie, motionless.  The meat fork
     still protrudes from his neck like an antenna.  

 TODD              Jesus Fucking Christ.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Suddenly Dussander is more awake than we realize.  When he hears
     Todd discover the body, he slides his chair over to the cellar 
     door and slams it shut.  His face is red with pain as he pushes
     the dead bolt into place, locking Todd in the cellar.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT & KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd races up to the door.  He tries the handle and then pounds 
     on the door with his fist.  The following conversation cuts back
     between Todd and Dussander on opposite sides of the door.  

 TODD              Open the fucking door!  Right now.  Right
             now! 

     Dussander shoves his chair under the doorknob.  He drags the 
     table against the door as he speaks.  Todd is screaming on the
     other side and begins to kick at the door violently.  

 DUSSANDER              You give me no choice, boy.  

 TODD              What are you doing?  Open the door.

 DUSSANDER              If you won't help me, then I'll make you help
             me.  If you don't, we are finished.  

 TODD              Fuck you, old man.  This is your problem.  I
             didn't do this.  Open the door!  

     Todd pounds awayat the door.  Tears now stream down his cheeks.
     His relentless pounding has Dussander enraged.  Dussander pounds
     back at the door to shut Todd up.  It works.  

 DUSSANDER              Enough.  Enough.  Enough!  If you don't stop
             screaming like a fucking school girl I'm
             going to...  

     A surge of pain from his chest silences him.  He recovers,
     speaking slowly and deliberately.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Now listen to me, boy, very carefully.  If
             you don't help me, I'm going to die here.  
             And if I die, there is no Stanford for you.  
             There is no scholarship.  There is jail.  My 
             document...  

 TODD              Fuck your document.  I got nothing to do with
             this.  Don't make it sound like I do.  I came
             here, I saw this shit, and now I'm getting 
             the fuck out of here.  That's what I'm gonna
             tell the police.  

 DUSSANDER              Why not tell them the truth?  Tell them I
             locked you in the cellar.  Tell them I 
             wouldn't let you out until you buried the
             body.  

 TODD              I'm not listening to this.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Todd runs down the stairs and leaps over Archie's body.  Under 
     the dim glow of a single naked bulb hanging from the ceiling, he
     searches for a way out.  He crosses the dirt floor toward a tiny
     window high on the opposite wall.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
 DUSSANDER              You must be at the window, yes?  As you can
             see I had it barred a few years ago.  A bad
             element started to move into the 
             neighborhood, you know how it is.  

 TODD (O.S.)              Fuck.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Todd realizes he can't get through the bars.  He turns around to
     find another option.  In the obscured background, Archie begins
     to stir.  Silent and bewildered, he feels the area around him 
     and rises slowly to his knees.  Todd doesn't see him and moves 
     into a dark corner of the cellar, rummaging through the piles of
     cluttered junk for something to help him escape.  He disappears
     for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a
     shovel, a fresh confidence on his face.  He holds it like a
     sledge hammer.  

 DUSSANDER (O.S.)              We are wasting time now, boy.  
                    (switches to a loud whisper) 
             Come back to the door.  You are not going to
             find anything down there to help you.  

 TODD                     (to himself)
             Oh really?  

     Todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from
     Archie when he sees him.  Todd, mortified, lets out a scream.
     This startles Archie, who cannot speak.  He only gurgles a
     SICKENING WHINE, the fork still sticks out of his neck.  Blood
     drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead.  Yet even on
     his knees, he is an imposing figure.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander, puzzled by the commotion, presses his ear against the
     door.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Archie blocks the stairs from Todd.  

 TODD              Get out of the way.

     But Archie is too disoriented to move.  Summoning all his
     courage, Todd pokes the shovel into him, as if to prod him out
     of the way.

     But when the blade of the shovel touches him, Archie counters
     violently, grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side.  
     Todd holds tightly to the handle, an act which sends him flying
     across the cellar.  The shovel stays with Archie, and now he 
     wields it like it were a child's toy.  He slashes it viciously
     through the air.  Todd hides under the stairs, watching Archie 
     duel with the shadows.  Todd bumps into something.  Archie hears
     him.  Through the slats in the staircase we see Archie jabbing
     the shovel at Todd.  

 TODD              Stop it!  Stop it!  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Alarmed, Dussander reaches for the lock, but hesitates, forever
     mindful of the chance of being duped.  His ear goes back against 
     the door.  

 DUSSANDER              What are you doing, boy?  It's not going to
             work, whatever it is.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Archie pushes the shovel in too far and can't retrieve it.  Todd
     grabs the other end and pulls it through.  

 TODD              Fuck this.  

     Fed up, he comes around from under the stairs and confronts
     Archie.  Archie sees him and takes a step toward him.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              I mean it get the fuck away from me.  

     Archie steps closer.  Instantly, Todd tightens his grip on the
     shovel.  He is no longer afraid.  He swings the shovel at 
     Archie's head striking him.  Archie staggers back, stunned, but 
     then charges forward.  Todd strikes him again, this time with
     more force and anger.  Todd lifts the shovel to strike again,
     but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade.
     The glass shatters.  The room goes black.  

     A second later we HEAR a SHARP, authoritative BLOW, followed 
     quickly by another, then another.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander knows something is wrong.  He slides the bolt back and
     slowly turns the handle.  He opens the door slightly and speaks
     into the darkness.  

 DUSSANDER              Hello?  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     A shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar
     floor, revealing Archie's slain body.  An expanding pool of
     blood seeps out from his head.  As the door upstairs opens 
     wider, the light falls on Todd standing over Archie, the shovel
     still in his hands, his face spattered with blood.

     The Todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed.  He
     stares up at Dussander, not with the eyes of a boy, but with 
     those of a man.  A man who can no longer be saved.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Quietly Dussander moves away from the door, leaving Todd alone
     with what he has done.  He slides the furniture away from the
     door, knowing, as Todd does, that the two of them are now
     working together.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - LATER 
     Todd's face is suddenly illuminated as he screws a fresh light 
     bulb into the dangling cord.  He picks up the shovel.  Archie's
     body still lies where it fell.  Todd goes to the open area of
     the floor and with a forceful stomp, plunges the shovel into the
     dirt.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER 
     Todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack
     the dirt, then smooths the area over to destroy any markings.
     He is sweaty, dirty, and tired.  But his manner is cool and
     efficient as he concentrates intently on the matters at hand.
     He runs upstairs, hopping over the bloody spot where Archie's
     body used to be.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd bursts through the door.  He notices the old man in his
     chair.  Dussander doesn't look good.  Todd levels his eyes at
     him.  His voice snaps with the authority of an S.S. commander.

 TODD              Where's the fucking pinesol?  

     Dussander points to the cabinet under the sink.  Todd throws the
     door open and pulls out bottles of cleaner.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Rags.  I need rags.  

 DUSSANDER              Cellar.  Under the stairs.  

     Todd checks the clock, it is 9:25.  He gets the bottle and a
     bucket and goes for the cellar.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     A SERIES OF SHOTS showing Todd cleaning up the mess.  He is on
     the stairs sponging up the blood.  Then we see him skimming the 
     area where the pool of blood was with the shovel.  The NEXT SHOT
     has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area.  Then, on his
     knees, he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light
     bulb and drops them into a bucket.  In the FINAL SHOT, Todd 
     stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar.  The shovel has
     been cleaned and replaced.  The floor looks smooth and even.
     Satisfied, he goes upstairs.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     The table has been put back in its spot.  Todd is in his boxer
     shorts.  A SHOT of a washing machine, somewhere else in the 
     house, shows us that Todd is cleaning his bloodied clothes.  Now
     he is washing the dishes in the sink.  The water in the sink is 
     a murky pink.  He pulls the meat fork from the suds and holds it up.  

 TODD              I ought to run this through your chest, you
             know that?

 DUSSANDER              It couldn't hurt more than a heart attack.  

     He looks at the clock - 10:15.

 TODD              Christ, my parents are going to freak.  

 DUSSANDER              Stay calm, boy.  You are doing fine.  

     Todd dries the murder weapon and puts it away.  For a moment he
     slows down, a hint of a smile suddenly comes over him.
     Dussander sees something is different about him.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              What are you thinking about?  

     The sound of Dussander's voice snaps Todd out of his funk.  He
     is all business again.

 TODD              Fuck off.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     Todd is back in his clothes.  He wears a white T-shirt.  He 
     brings a knife up to Dussander's neck and slices down his suit,
     still stained by Archie's blood.  

 TODD              Your pants are okay.  The shoes... no.

     Todd takes off Dussander's shoes and balls them up in the
     tattered suit.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Put this on.  

     He holds up Dussander's bathrobe.  The old man slips into it
     with difficulty as Todd dumps the bloodied clothing into a trash
     bag.  Dussander looks at Todd's T-shirt.  

 DUSSANDER              Is that my undershirt?  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     The blood and glass have been removed.  Todd runs a mop over the
     floor.  His job is almost over.  Sweat pours down his face.  The
     same for Dussander.  

 DUSSANDER              Hurry up, for God's sake.  

 TODD              Don't you die on me, you old bastard.  Not
             now.

     Todd puts the mop away.  He surveys the room as before.  
     Dussander does the same.  There is a strange silence as the two
     of them look around the room for anything damning.  

 DUSSANDER              I think we're okay.  

 TODD              Me too.  

 DUSSANDER              Call an ambulance. 

     Todd turns to face Dussander.  He brings his face up to his and
     speaks softly.

 TODD              The key.  

 DUSSANDER              What are you talking about?  

 TODD              The safety deposit box.  I want the key...  

 DUSSANDER              For God's sake, boy...  

 TODD              I want the key and I want to know where the
             bank is.

     Dussander cannot argue.

 DUSSANDER              Hillcrest Savings on Domingo Avenue.  The key
             is behind the clock on the mantle piece.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
     Todd goes straight for the mantle.  He moves the clock and finds
     the key.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd holds a blank piece of paper in front of Dussander and
     hands him a pen.  

 TODD              Sign this.  

 DUSSANDER              What for?  

 TODD              Sign it.  

     Dussander starts to scrawl his name across the paper.  

 TODD              No!  At the bottom... neatly.

     With great difficulty, Dussander does as he is told.  Todd folds
     the paper and stuffs it into his pocket with the pen.  He picks
     up the phone and dials.  

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)              911 emergency.  Do you need an ambulance?  

 TODD              Yes.  It's my friend, Mr. Du--

     Todd nearly bites his lip in half.  Dussander notices the slip
     and cringes.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Denker.  He had a heart attack.  

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)              Is he conscious?  

 TODD              Yeah, he's awake.  I'm really scared.  The
             address is 9 -- 

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)              We have the address here.  The ambulance is 
             on the way.  It should take about ten
             minutes.  I'll stay on the line with you -- 

 TODD              No.  I have to call my parents.  Just send
             the ambulance -- 

     He hangs up.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              It smells too clean in here.  

     Todd sees a pack of cigarettes on the table.  

 TODD (CONT'D)                     (offering)
             Cigarette?  

     Dussander is not amused.  Todd lights two cigarettes and lets 
     them burn down in the ashtray.  He picks up the phone again and
     dials.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Mommy, it's me.  Let me talk to Dad.  

 MONICA (V.O.)              What is it?  

 TODD              Just let me talk to him.  

 MONICA (V.O.)              Hold on -- 

 DICK (V.O.)              Todd, what's wrong.

 TODD              Mr. Denker had a heart attack.  

 DICK (V.O.)              Jesus.  Is he conscious?  

 TODD              Yeah, he's awake.  

 DICK (V.O.)              Thank God.  Todd, call an ambulance.  

 TODD              I did.  They're on the way.  

 DICK (V.O.)              All right, son.  Don't touch him.  I'll be
             there in five minutes.  

 TODD              Okay.  

     He hangs up.  He sits down across from Dussander.  The old man
     is near death, but through the slit of an eye he watches Todd.
     The stare between them is lethal.  For a long moment this
     continues until...

 TODD (CONT'D)              Fuck!  

 DUSSANDER              What?  What is it?  

 TODD              The letter.  Where is the goddamn letter?  I
             told my parents I came over to read you a
             letter from Germany.  

 DUSSANDER              A letter.  Yes, we'll say it's from Willi
             Frankel -- 

 TODD              We need a letter.  I told them it was your
             nephew, I think.  

 DUSSANDER              My bedroom.  Look in the dresser.  Second, no
             third, drawer... from the top.  There is a 
             small wooden box.  You will have to break it 
             open.  I lost the key.  There are letters,
             very old ones.  From a friend.  All in 
             German.  None of them are signed or dated.  A
             page or two will be fine.  

     Todd turns to go and stops.

 TODD              Are you crazy?  I don't read German, you numb
             fuck.  

 DUSSANDER              Why would Willi write me in English?  If you 
             were to read me the letter in German, I would
             understand even though you would not.  Your 
             pronunciation would be terrible, but I could
             manage -- 

 TODD              All right.  All right.  

     Todd dashes out of the room.  


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT 
     Dick's Porsche speeds along the same streets that Todd took two
     hours earlier.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of 
     the dresser.  He yanks on the drawer.  It comes half way out and
     stops.  

 TODD              Goddamn you, come out.  

     The drawer flies out, knocking Todd back.  He digs through it, 
     the contents of Dussander's fake lives spilling about the room.
     He finds the box at the bottom.  As he expected, it is locked.
     Without a moment's hesitation, he slams the box down on the post
     of the bed frame.  It doesn't open, but bits of the frame fly
     across the room.  

     On the third attempt the tiny box shatters.  Todd freezes, cocks
     his head.  Outside he hears the distinct ROAR and sputter of the
     Porsche engine.  He grabs two pages of a letter.  There is 
     nothing he can do about the mess in the room.  He closes the 
     door on his way back to the kitchen.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     Todd enters the kitchen and places the pages on the table just 
     in time to look up and see Dick standing in the kitchen doorway.  

 TODD              Dad.  

     We hold on Dick for a moment as he takes it all in: Dussander,
     Todd, and the room.  A hint of uncertainty crosses his face.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     A PARAMEDIC straps Dussander onto a stretcher.  Todd is talking
     to the other one.  

 TODD              He started laughing at something in the 
             letter.  I don't know what it was, it's in
             German.

     Dick sees the letter on the table and picks it up.  Todd watches
     him.  Without much of a thought, Dick puts the letter back on
     the table.  

 PARAMEDIC              Well, we'll take care of him now.  We're 
             going to take him to St. Luke's.  It's a good
             thing you called when you did.  You saved his
             life.  

     The medics wheel Dussander out.  

 DICK              You did real good, son.  
                    (looking around the room, as if
                    searching for something)
             You did real good...  

     Todd doesn't like Dick's apprehension.  He grabs his father's
     hand and leads him out of the room.  

 TODD              C'mon.  Let's make sure he gets checked in
             all right.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
     TWO ORDERLIES push a gurney through the door.  A man in his late
     thirties, DAVID KRAUSS, walks with them.  A NURSE, following
     behind, addresses him.

 NURSE              He needs to rest now.  You can come back 
             tomorrow after ten.  

     David approaches the gurney.  Lying prone is BEN KRAUSS, 70.
     David kisses him on the forehead.  

 DAVID              I'll be back in the morning with the girls.  

 BEN              I can't wait to see them.  

     The orderlies lift Ben onto his bed.  

 NURSE                     (to Ben) 
             The doctor will be in to see you in a few
             minutes.

 BEN              Thank you.

     The orderlies, the nurse and David leave the room.  Ben notices
     his roommate in the next bed.  It is Dussander, who has been
     watching all of this quietly.  

 BEN (CONT'D)              My nephew, David.  

     Dussander smiles politely.  

 BEN (CONT'D)              His parents died when he was very young.  He
             is like a son to me.  I have no children of
             my own.

 DUSSANDER              I see.  

 BEN              David is very protective of me.  Of course, I
             don't mind.  I enjoy his company.  A few 
             years ago he started working with me at the
             university.  I teach chemistry.  My name is
             Ben, by the way.  

 DUSSANDER              Arthur.  

 BEN              A pleasure, Arthur.  What do you do?  

 DUSSANDER              I'm retired.  

     Pause.  

 BEN              These tubes in my arm.  No one said they
             would itch like this.  

 DUSSANDER              You will find, in time, you don't notice.  

     Ben looks oddly at Dussander.  The wheels of his memory slowly,
     very slowly, begin to turn.  

 BEN              Well, we'll see.  Looks like I'll be here for
             a while.  I didn't want to alarm my nephew
             just yet, but this break in my leg...  well,
             we'll see what the doctor says.  

 DUSSANDER              Yes, of course.  But for now, you must 
             forgive me, my medication has made me drowsy.
             Do not be offended if I fall asleep.  

 BEN              Don't be offended if I keep talking anyway.  
             It beats wondering if I'm ever going to walk 
             again.  I tell you, my friend, the ways of
             God are not meant to be understood.  

     But Ben's words are lost on a sleeping man.  He continues to
     stare at Dussander.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY 
     Todd comes through the front door, using his key to get in.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     Todd grabs the letter off the table and stuffs it into a plastic
     trash bag.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
     Todd manages to get the drawer back into the dresser.  He throws
     all the remaining debris and bits of wood into the trash bag.  He
     goes to the closet and searches through the clothes.  He 
     finds the S.S. uniform, now tattered from many night of fitful
     sleep, and places it in the trash bag.  


 INT. HILLCREST SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY 
     The BANK CLERK behind the counter is a fat, elderly woman, 
     pleasant-faced and not too sharp.  Todd stands solemnly on the 
     other side of the counter.  She stares hard at a piece of paper.
     We see that it is a note: "Please allow my grandson, Todd, to
     retrieve my insurance documents from my safety deposit box.  
     Thank you, Arthur Denker."  It is Dussander's phony signature
     at the bottom.  

 TODD              He's really sick. ...Please.

     The woman looks up at Todd, the key in his hand, then back down
     at the note.  


 INT. BANK SAFE - DAY 
     The woman inserts her key into the first lock and Todd does the 
     same in the second.  A moment later he is holding the box in his
     hands.  

 BANK CLERK              I sure hope your granddaddy feels better.
             You can bring that in here.  

     She escorts him to a small room where he can view the contents
     of the box.  She leaves.  


 INT. BANK - SMALL ROOM - DAY 
     Todd puts the box on a table and opens it.  It is nearly empty:
     a few old photographs, some financial records.  There is no
     document.  Todd is swept up in a wave of emotion-- anger,
     relief, contempt.  He's been played like a fool, but is 
     nonetheless grateful.  Ultimately, he is so overwhelmed a laugh
     springs from his lips.  

 TODD              Son of a bitch.  

     He scoops out the contents of the box and puts them in his pocket.  


 INT. BANK SAFE - DAY 
     On the other side of the door, the clerk listens curiously to
     Todd's words.  She pushes her ear against the door to hear more.  


 EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK 
     Todd has dug a hole in a remote location.  He empties the
     letters, the S.S. uniform, and the contents from the safety 
     deposit box into the hole.  A little lighter fluid.  A match.
     Todd watches the evidence burn.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
     Todd stands next to the bed holding a small clump of flowers.
     Dussander notices the bouquet.  

 DUSSANDER              You shouldn't have.  

     Todd is aware that Ben is listening, even though he is 
     pretending not to.  Todd goes to put the flowers in a glass of
     water.  He sets the glass on the table by the bed.  

 TODD              They're from my mother.  

     He sits in the chair by the bed and lowers his voice.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Here.  

     He flicks a tattered photo onto the bed.  We recognize it as one 
     from the safety deposit box.  It is a black and white portrait
     of a woman and a small boy.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Everything else I burned.  

     Dussander grins weekly.

 DUSSANDER              I had to protect myself from you, boy.  

     Todd drags a screen over to prevent Ben from hearing.  Long pause.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              I suspect that we shall never see each other
             again.

 TODD              No, I don't think we will.  

     Dussander looks almost hurt to hear Todd say it.  Pause.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Well, I better go.  

 DUSSANDER              Wait, boy... There is something I want to ask
             you.  

 TODD              What?  

     Dussander waves him over with his finger.  Reluctantly, Todd
     brings his ear an inch from Dussander's mouth.  

 DUSSANDER              ...Was it like you thought?  

     Todd pulls his head back, stands up.  He contemplates the 
     question, ...confessing.  He touches Dussander on the shoulder.  

 TODD              I should go.  

     He turns for the door.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps... perhaps I could persuade you to
             wait here just until I fall asleep.  This
             medicine makes me quite woozy... please.  

     Todd resigns himself to stay.  He picks up a magazine and begins
     to read, not even looking at Dussander.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
     Todd emerges from behind the screen toward the door.  Dussander
     is asleep.  

 BEN              Excuse me, young man.  

     Todd is startled.  

 BEN (CONT'D)              You're a fine boy to visit your grandfather
             like that.  

 TODD              Thanks.  But he's just a friend.

 BEN              Is that right?  Well, you are a good friend 
             to him.  Tell me, is he bad off?  He doesn't 
             talk much.

 TODD              The doctors say he'll be out soon.  

 BEN              That is good news, indeed.  Tell me, from the 
             way he speaks I'd guess he's been
             naturalized, like me.  Is he?  

     Todd is starting to be wary of where this is going.  

 TODD              He's from Germany... From Essen.  Do you know
             that town?  

 BEN              I was only in Germany once.  I'm Polish.  
             Originally, I mean, I'm from Radom.  I wonder
             if he was in the war.  

 TODD              I really couldn't say.  

 BEN              It doesn't matter, I suppose.  It was a long
             time ago, the war.  Soon in this country we
             may have a president born after the war was
             over.  How about that?  

     Todd starts to leave.  

 TODD              I'm sure you're right.  

 BEN              Your friend is lucky to have you.  A great 
             man once said, 'No man is an island entire of
             itself.' 

 TODD              John Donne.  Take care, sir.  

     Todd heads for the door.  He stops, turns back to Dussander's
     bed.  He contemplates something... waking him.  He decides
     against it.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Good-bye.  

 BEN              Good-bye.  

     Todd exits.  Ben sits quietly for a moment, thinking.  He turns
     on the television-- "The Price is Right".  We hear it over the
     following.  Ben glances over at the screen which separates him
     from Dussander.  Slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy.  He
     starts to nod off.  But as sleep begins to envelope him, his 
     eyes suddenly fly open.  A surge of terror burns across his
     face.  

     He sits up frightened.  A single crutch stands next to the bed.
     He grabs it.  He strips away his covers and the restraints on 
     his leg, once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell
     a painful scream.  He gets to his feet awkwardly, hobbling, 
     half-dragging his bad leg.  Every step he takes is a study in
     agony.

     ANGLE on the screen.  It slides out of the way, revealing Ben 
     staring down at the sleeping Dussander.  In the pained struggle
     to keep silent, he brings his face right up to Dussander's,
     close enough to smell his breath.  


 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUING 
     Ben stumbles out of his room into the hall.  The crutch falls to
     the ground.  He slides against the wall toward the nurses' 
     station.  Tears stream down his face.  As he clutches the wall,
     we glimpse the faded green numbers on his forearm.  

     He reaches the nurse's desk.  She is on the phone.  He grabs her
     by the shoulder and pulls her face up into his.  She lets out a 
     startled SCREAM.  But Ben's emotion stops her from resisting.  
     He is sobbing uncontrollably.  Orderlies appear and pull him off
     of her.  He collapses to the ground, consumed by grief.  

 BLACK. 

 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander slowly wakes up for the first time since his surgery.  
     A large black man, DARREN, stands above him changing the IV bag.
     He notices Dussander is awake.  Dussander's voice is low and
     hoarse from hours of sedation.  

 DUSSANDER              Where's the nurse?  

 DARREN              My name is Darren.  I'll be taking care of 
             you from now on.  I'll tell the doctor you've
             woken up.  

     Darren finishes with the IV unit and goes to the door.  
     Dussander watches him, a bit puzzled, but his eyes are closed
     again before Darren is out of the room.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
     Dussander wakes up again.  Something is different in his room.  
     He looks to the table next to him.  All his magazines are gone.
     He looks to the other side of the room.  Ben is gone, his bed
     stripped of all linen.  Finally he looks to the door.  It is 
     cracked open.  Two men in suits are talking in the hallway.  One
     we will come to know as Detective GETTY.  The other is a
     subordinate.  Dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees.  He
     reaches over for the call button and rings it several times.  

     A moment later Darren comes in.  Getty sees this and stops
     talking.  He watches Dussander from the hall.  

 DARREN              Did you need something?  

 DUSSANDER              What is going on here?  Where is Ben?  

 DARREN              Mr. Krauss has been moved.  I'm going to give
             you something.  It will help you sleep.  

     Darren readies Dussander's arm for an injection.  

 DUSSANDER              I don't want it.  Who is that man?  

     Before Dussander can protest, Darren sticks him with the needle.  

 DARREN              Your surgery was a success.  Just try to
             relax.

 FADE TO BLACK. 

 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 
 WEISKOPF (O.S.)                     (in German)
             Wake up.  Wake up, old man.  

     Dussander's eyes open.  The first thing he sees are three men,
     all in suits, standing over him.  

                          DUSSANDER (in German)
             Are you speaking to me?  

     The voice comes from WEISKOPF, 40's.  His suit is dark gray, 
     well tailored, probably European.  He speaks eloquently despite
     an accent that shows roots of Europe and the Middle East.  

 WEISKOPF                     (back in English)
             No one else is here.  

     Dussander looks over at Ben's former bed.  

 WEISKOPF (CONT'D)              Mr. Krauss is recuperating elsewhere.  Are
             you awake now, Dussander?  

 DUSSANDER              Yes, of course, but you seem to have me
             confused with someone else.  My name is 
             Arthur Denker.  Perhaps you want a different
             room -- 

     Weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed.  Dussander notices the pin
     on his lapel.  A small, silver Star of David.  

 WEISKOPF              My name is Weiskopf.  You are Kurt Dussander.  

 DUSSANDER              I know no one by that name.  Shall I ring for
             the nurse?  

     Dussander reaches for the Call button and stops in horror.  He 
     looks at his hands.  His fingertips are smeared with black ink.
     He looks up at the men in disbelief.  

 WEISKOPF              The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss.
             He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin.
             You were responsible for the death of his 
             wife and two daughters.  His identification
             of you was quite specific.  I'm sure his 
             reward from my government will help offset
             the burden of his broken leg.  

 DUSSANDER              My name is Arthur Denker.  I am an American-- 

 WEISKOPF              Please don't bother.  Your papers will not 
             stand up to serious examination and you know
             it.  

     The detective, GETTY, snaps a few pictures of Dussander.  The
     other man is FBI Special Agent DAN RICHLER.  

 RICHLER              We have all we need here, Isaac.  

 DUSSANDER              Who are you men?  What are your names?  

 RICHLER              My name is Richler, FBI.  This is Detective
             Getty from the Orange County Sheriff's
             Department.  

 WEISKOPF              And I think you know who I work for.  When
             you get your strength back, you will be 
             moved.  Until then, this entire ward will be
             under surveillance.  You can expect to be in
             Tel Aviv by the end of the summer.  

     The three men are out the door.  


 INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Todd's room is dark as he lies on the floor, writing something 
     on a pile of index cards.  The only light comes from the hallway
     through the open door of the bedroom.  Todd is deep in thought,
     but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the
     writing is not coming easily.  

 TODD              The road ahead reveals itself, uh, God, no.
             The road ahead... grrrr, The fucking road
             ahead.

     Monica appears in the doorway.  

 MONICA              Todd?

     Todd doesn't notice her.  He stares down at the card.  Finally he
     looks up, as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in
     his mind.  His response is hardly audible.  

 TODD              Huh?  

 MONICA              What are you doing there in the dark?  

 TODD              Oh, ...working.  

     Monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light.  She touches
     the switch but then pulls her hand back.  Todd is back at the 
     note card.  She looks at him oddly, worried, but then steps away
     from the door and goes downstairs.

     Todd's lips are moving, as if he were speaking to himself.  He
     pauses.  Then, in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write
     furiously.  He finishes and stands up, catching his reflection 
     in the mirror above his desk.  In the eerie half-light, he
     stares at the ghost-like image of himself.  


 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD (GRADUATION) - DAY 
     Todd, in cap and gown, is seeing his parents to their seats in 
     the second row.  Ed French comes up to Todd and puts his hand on
     his shoulder.  Todd is startled.  

 TODD              Mr. French.  

 FRENCH              Hello, Todd.  It's your big day, isn't it?  

     They shake hands.  French sees Dick and Monica sitting behind
     Todd.  Before Todd can stop him, he introduces himself.  

 FRENCH (CONT'D)              These must be your parents.
                    (extends hand) 
             Hi, Ed French.  It's good to finally meet
             you.  

     Dick and Monica are the picture of happiness, hardly the
     dysfunctional drunkards that French believed them to be.  They 
     all shake hands.  

 DICK              Dick Bowden, nice to meet you.  This is my
             wife, Monica.  

 MONICA              Are you one of Todd's teachers?  

     French is a bit puzzled.  

 FRENCH              No.  I'm his guidance counsellor.  

     A WOMAN behind Monica taps her on the shoulder.  

 WOMAN              Monica, I thought that was you.  

     Monica turns away from French.  Suddenly, the band strikes up
     opening notes to "Pomp and Circumstance."

 TODD                     (to French)
             That's our cue.  

 FRENCH                     (to Dick) 
             It was nice meeting you.  

 DICK              You too.  
                    (to Todd)
             Good luck, son.  

 FRENCH              I'll talk to you and your wife after the
             ceremony.  

     Todd and French dash off in different directions.  


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - LATER 
     Standing at the podium is a black, female graduate, TASHA 
     LITTLE.  She is reading the end of a poem by Emily Dickinson.  
     Principal Morgan and Todd sit in chairs next to the podium. In
     the b.g. is the graduating class, Joey is among them.   French
     sits among the faculty, who are lined up to the right of the
     podium.  

 TASHA              Thy sacred emblems to partake -
             Thy consecrated bread to take 
             And thine immortal wine!  

     There is polite applause from the audience as she takes her seat
     and Morgan goes to the podium.  

 MORGAN              Thank you, Miss Little for that superb
             invocation.

     Pause.  More applause.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              And now it gives me great pleasure to
             introduce a young man who's academic 
             achievement at this institution stands as
             testament to the power of hard work and 
             determination.  Todd had a tough time a few
             months ago, so by God, he buckled down, hit
             the books, and pulled himself through it.  

     Todd's eyes scan the crowd indifferently.  He notices Becky,
     seated in the audience near some friends.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              Ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty,
             here to deliver the student remembrance for 
             the class of 1985, this year's valedictorian,
             Todd Bowden.

     The crowd burst into applause.  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY 
     A half dozen police cars are in front of the house.  One OFFICER
     is blocking off the entire yard with yellow tape.  A news van
     pulls up.


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING 
     Todd shakes Morgan's hand and takes the podium.  The crowd
     quiets.  Todd begins: 

 TODD              We all have dreams that we carry with us.
             Perhaps it is a dream of prosperity, or 
             happiness.  But now, so early in our lives, 
             it seems that all we should ask for is to be
             at peace with the world, because only then
             can we be at peace with ourselves.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY 
     Weiskopf and Richler, both wearing rubber gloves, are carefully
     looking through the contents of Dussander's dresser.  They pour
     over everything, placing some items in clear plastic bags.  A
     few DEPUTIES are milling around.  Richler picks up a small
     photograph of a young woman.  Todd's voice comes in: 

 TODD (V.O.)              We learn from our education that we are the 
             master's of our own destinies.  We learn what
             it is that separates us from the others, why
             we are special.  

 RICHLER              What about this?  

 WEISKOPF              Yes.  All photographs.  

     Detective Getty comes in.

 GETTY              You boys better come down to the cellar.
             You're not going to believe this.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - DAY 
     Getty comes down the steps followed by Weiskopf and Richler.
     Weiskopf gazes across the cellar.  Whatever he sees disturbs
     him.  He turns away and goes back up the stairs.  

 TODD (V.O.)              Each of us have unique talents and interests
             unlike those of anyone else.  The challenge 
             now, as we stand at the doorway to adulthood,
             is to channel our abilities into our goals.  

     Richler, moves to the rail and looks out, disgusted.  He pulls a
     handkerchief from his pocket and covers his nose and mouth.  A
     DEPUTY, wearing rubber gloves, carries the shovel up to him.  


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING 
     As Todd speaks, he notices his parents, Becky, various teachers.
     His eyes stop on Ed French, who is looking oddly at something in
     the crowd.  

 ANGLE ON FRENCH 
     French notices an elderly couple walking down the aisles of
     seated spectators as if they are looking for someone.  

 TODD (O.C.)              We forge our own paths.  Our education is but
             a stepping stone to the world.  

     They are Victor and Agnes Bowden, looking for Dick and Monica.
     Todd sees them too.  He pauses almost imperceptibly.  He looks
     back at French.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Our.. Our true destinies await us.  There we
             become the...

     Todd's grandparents come down the aisle to see Dick and Monica
     in the second row.  They start to slide in, causing a slight
     ruckus.  Dick is surprised to see his parents, but smiles and
     makes room for them.  French watches all of this curiously.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              There we become the men and women that will
             make a difference.  But we must take away 
             from this place a sense of purpose for
             ourselves.  We now begin to see the road 
             ahead.  It is a road from which we cannot
             veer.

     A connection is made between French, Todd, and the Bowden
     family.


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - LATER 
     Morgan is reading the last of the names as the graduates file
     past and collect their diplomas.  

 MORGAN              Andrew Woodman... Donald Young... Karmisha 
             Youngblood... David Zedek... Kyle Zuckerman.
             The graduating class of 1985.  

     The crowd cheers as the graduates throw their caps into the air.
     The band begins to play.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              Now we invite all the friends and parents to
             join the students and faculty in the main
             courtyard for refreshments.  

     Todd, still pale, bolts off the stage.  He reaches his parents.
     French starts to walk down to the Bowdens.  Todd goes up to his
     mother.  

 MONICA              Honey.  

 TODD              Mom, I don't feel so good.  

 MONICA              What's wrong?  

 TODD              I don't know, I feel like I'm going to pass
             out.  Can we go home?  

 AGNES              You looked real good up there, Todd.  

     Todd ignores her.  

 DICK              Don't you want to see your buddies?  

 TODD              I want to go, Dad.  Right now.  

     Todd and his family start off.  As they leave the CAMERA MOVES
     to show Ed French working his way through the crowd past the
     spot where they had been standing.


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
     The following series of images appear under music:

     The quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied 
     sea of reporters, cameramen, photographers, and police officers.
     Everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity
     through the window that looks into Dussander's room.  Inside, 
     Weiskopf and Richler are speaking to the doctors.  Getty stands
     to the side, instructing the DEPUTY who guards the door.  

     Through all of this Dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as
     the bodies whirl around him.  Darren enters the room to change
     Dussander's IV bag.  

     Suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in,
     snapping pictures wildly.  Getty and the other officers descend
     upon him.  The camera flashes.  Other photographers try to get
     in but are blocked.  Pandemonium.  

     Yet Dussander seems oblivious to the commotion.  His eyes are
     nothing more than glazed slits, his mouth hangs open.  Darren 
     runs toward the door to help.  Dussander's eyes open slightly.
     There is life behind them after all.  He turns his attention
     imperceptibly toward his IV bag...  

     The camera moves away from Dussander to the window.  Outside in
     the parking lot, groups of protesters have gathered.  Some hold 
     candles.  Others chant and wave signs.  News reporters surround 
     them.


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY 
     ANGLE on a ticking wall clock.  

     Todd appears apprehensive as he sits down on the couch next to 
     his mother.  She puts her arm around him.  He is pale and
     glassy-eyed.  His parents don't look much better.  Dick is
     especially nervous and stands off to the side, watching everyone
     intently.  Richler and Weiskopf sit across the room in chairs.  

 RICHLER              Todd, my name is Dan Richler.  I'm a special 
             agent with the FBI.  This is my associate, Dr.
             Weiskopf.  

 WEISKOPF              Hello.  

 DICK              What kind of doctor are you?  

 WEISKOPF              I'm a school teacher.  

 RICHLER              Dr. Weiskopf is a professor at the Judaic
             Institute in Munich.  He is assisting the 
             Israeli government in certain matters.  He is
             here today, only as an observer.  

     A moment passes between Weiskopf and Todd.  

 RICHLER (CONT'D)              Thanks for calling us up, Mr. Bowden.  You 
             saved us the trouble of tracking through the
             911 records.

 DICK              Actually, it was Todd's idea to call.  He 
             thought... we thought there might be some way
             we could help your investigation.  

 RICHLER              Todd, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to hear
             about your involvement with Dussander... but
             you knew him as Arthur Denker, right?

 TODD              Yeah.  I never knew of that other name till I
             saw it in the paper.

 RICHLER              How did you know him?  

     Todd starts to rub his stomach.

 TODD              I met him at the movies.  Last summer.  ...He
             asked me where to pick up the number seven
             bus.  He said his eyes weren't too good.
             ...Will you excuse me for a minute?  

     He gets up before Richler can answer walks toward the stairs.  

 MONICA              You okay, honey?  

 TODD              I just gotta use the bathroom.  I'll be right
             back.  

     He vanishes up the stairs.  They all watch him go.  Monica turns
     to Richler.

 MONICA              He's not feeling well.  

     ANGLE on Dick.

 MONICA (CONT'D)              Can I get you some coffee?  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
     The faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as Todd digs 
     through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of Pepto-
     Bismol.  He takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the
     bottle.  He finishes and takes a few deep breaths.  

     As he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror.  An
     empty bottle in his hand, a bright pink ring around his lips, a 
     few pink splotches down his shirt-- he looks totally ridiculous.
     Todd can't help but laugh.  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
     The interview continues.  The clock ticks on.  Richler drinks
     from a coffeee cup.  Todd is back in his seat.  

 RICHLER              Todd, let me tell you what we're really 
             interested in here.  You told the admitting 
             nurse that Denker had a heart attack while 
             you were reading him a letter.

 TODD              That's right.  I was.  That's what I was
             doing there.  It was in German but he 
             insisted I try to read it anyway.  Once or
             twice he got pissy about the pronunciation 
             but I asked him what did he want from me.  I
             don't speak German.  Mr. Denker...
             Dussander... got really excited at one point.
             He yelled out, "Yes, that's what you would do
             all right." but I didn't know what he was 
             talking about.  Then he grabbed his chest.  

 RICHLER              And that's when you called the ambulance,
             right?

 TODD              That's right.  

 RICHLER              Well, this is the part we can't figure out.
             The letter itself, Todd... do you remember
             what happened to it?  

 TODD              I guess it was still on the table.  I
             couldn't swear to it, but --

 DICK              Wait, I saw a letter.  It was in German.  I
             didn't think anything of it at the time.
             But, yeah, it was on Airmail stationery.  

 RICHLER              Then it should still be there.  This is our
             problem.  

 DICK              It isn't?  

 RICHLER              No.  

 MONICA              Maybe somebody broke in.  

 RICHLER              Why would somebody break into his house 
             simply to steal a letter? ...Unless... there
             was someone... someone right here in Santo
             Donato who would want to protect him for some 
             reason.  Maybe a close friend, or even 
             another fugitive.  I know it sounds like a
             bunch of Robert Ludlum stuff, but when
             Dussander was taken to the hospital, we think
             our Mr. X scooted over to the house and
             swiped the letter.  

 TODD              That doesn't make sense.  

 RICHLER              Why not, Todd?  

 TODD              Well, if Denk... if he had an old Nazi buddy
             in town, why didn't he come over himself and
             read the letter to him?  If you could have 
             heard the way he corrected me at every word--

 RICHLER              A good point.  Except maybe this other fellow 
             is in a wheelchair, or blind.  

 TODD              Guys that are blind don't normally go
             scooting out to steal letters.

 RICHLER                     (smiling) 
             True.  Did Dussander have any friends that
             you knew of?  

 TODD              No, not really.  

 RICHLER              How about phone calls?  

     Pause.  

 TODD              No, I heard his phone ring maybe five or six
             times in all the time I knew him.  It was
             never anything out of the ordinary.
             Salesmen.  Wrong numbers.  

 RICHLER              Did you ever hear him speak German on those
             occasions?  

 TODD              No.  He hardly ever spoke German.  He always
             said he would teach me someday, but he never 
             got around to it.  

 WEISKOPF              Did he ever talk about his past?  

     Todd looks at Weiskopf.  This is the first question he has asked
     and Todd is more wary of him than of Richler.  Todd shrugs
     innocently.

 TODD              Not really.  Little bits, I guess.  

 MONICA              Well, don't you remember what he told us at
             Thanksgiving?

     Todd looks at her.  

 MONICA (CONT'D)              He said he was in college-- 

 DICK                     (shutting her up) 
             Monica.  They don't care what we know, they
             care what Todd knows.  

     Silence.  Richler notices the tension in the room.  He looks at
     Weiskopf.  Finally, he speaks to Dick.  

 RICHLER              Look, I'm sure this whole thing has come as a
             terrible shock.  I think we've done enough
             for the day.  

     He and Weiskopf stand.  Dick is almost surprised that they are
     leaving so soon.  

 WEISKOPF              Thank you, Todd.  Mr. and Mrs. Bowden.  

     Weiskopf nods good-bye.  

 DICK              Wait a minute... Agent Richler, before you 
             go--  Todd's not a suspect in this, is he?  I
             mean he's just talking to you, right?  

 RICHLER              That's right.  

 DICK              Because Todd always thought he was helping 
             that old man.  We didn't know any of this
             before today.  

 RICHLER              Mr. Bowden, you and Todd have nothing to 
             worry about.  I assure you.  Your son has 
             been a great service to us.  Thank you, Todd.
             For now that's all we need.  Our next step is
             to turn that house upside down.  We're
             bringing in some special teams to look 
             through everything.  We may come up with 
             something.  We'll be in touch if we need you.  

     They are almost to the door, when Richler stops.  

 RICHLER (CONT'D)              Oh, Todd, by the way....
                    (casually, pulls a photo out of a
                    folder he is carrying) 
             Have you ever seen this man before?  

     He holds the photo up to Todd.  It is a picture of Archie in
     military dress, probably a blow-up of his military ID.  Todd
     stares at it for a moment.  His face shows no reaction.

 TODD              No.  

 RICHLER              Okay, thanks.  

     He smiles.  Weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave.  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY 
     From his window Todd sees Richler and Weiskopf talking by their
     gray sedan.  

 TODD              You'll be back, won't you boys?  Won't you,
             Special agent Jackoff.  You and the sheeny 
             professor. ...I know, let's show him an old
             army picture, that'll screw him up. ...Fuck
             you.  Fuck-You.


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
     Dick is half-way up the stairs when he hears yelling coming from
     Todd's room.  He pauses a moment.  Most of Todd's words aren't
     clear, but the profanity sure is...  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY 
     After a moment, the sedan pulls away.  Todd turns away from the
     window and we see that he is holding the barrel of the rifle in 
     one hand and the scope in the other.  

     He takes a few breaths, tries to calm down.  A burst of nervous
     laughter slips out of him.  

     There is a KNOCK at the door.  Two seconds later Dick comes in.  

     DICK'S POV: Todd stands in the middle of his room.  The gun
     pieces are nowhere in sight.  

 DICK              Everything all right, son?  

 TODD              Yeah... fine.  

 DICK              You sure?  

 TODD              I'm fine, Dad.  

 DICK              Your mother and I feel terrible... like we...  

 TODD              It's not your fault.  

     Dick grabs his son and pulls him close.  Todd doesn't know how
     to respond.  For Dick, it is like hugging a phone pole.  He 
     knows something is terribly wrong.  Todd stands stiff in his
     father's arms until he releases him.  

 DICK              You know we love you, don't you?  

 TODD              I know, Dad.  

     He smiles at his father, comfortingly.  Dick is not comforted.  

 DICK              Look, ahh, your mother and I are going to go
             down and talk to our lawyer.  I don't want
             you to worry about a thing.  It's just a 
             precaution.  I don't trust these cops.  We're
             not going to be gone long.

 TODD              Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.  

 DICK              Your old man is on top of things, all right?
             I am going to take care of this.  

 TODD              I know, Dad.  

     Dick kisses Todd's forehead.  He turns to leave and stops.  

 DICK              This afternoon, if you're up for it, we'll go
             do something.  How 'bout it?  

 TODD              Sure.  

     Dick tries to smile and goes out, the door, leaving Todd alone.


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     The garage door opens and Dick backs the Porsche into the
     street.  Monica is with him.  Todd, from the upstairs window, 
     watches them go.  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
     Todd is near the end of his rope, trying to hold himself
     together.  We see him splashing water on his face in the 
     bathroom.  He gazes into the mirror, transfixed by the ghost- 
     like image reflected back at him.  Todd pounds his fist against
     the sink.  He can stand it no longer.  He darts out of the
     bathroom.  


 EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY 
     Todd drives his mother's Honda wagon towards the entrance of the
     hospital and for the first time witnesses the scope of
     Dussander's discovery.  News vans are everywhere.  The 
     protesters have grown in number.  A line of cars wait for 
     admittance into the parking lot.  A policeman stands a few feet
     away from Todd, directing cars in, turning others away.  He is
     moving toward Todd.  Horns honk around him.  Todd sees that more
     police officers are standing by the door of the hospital.  The
     nearby policeman notices Todd and walks closer.  Todd doesn't
     wait.  He pulls the car out of line and drives off.


 INT. HONDA WAGON - DAY 
     Todd holds the steering wheel with a white-knuckled grip.  His 
     face is sweaty and flushed.  He rocks back and forth as he tries
     to reassure himself...  

 TODD              We're okay.  We're okay.  We're o-kay.

     He is almost calm when he nears his house.  But it doesn't last.
     He sees something he can hardly believe.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              You got to be fucking kidding me.


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     An old Vo1vo is parked on the street in front of the house.
     Standing on the porch, sneakers and all, is Ed French.  Todd 
     pulls into the driveway and gets out.  French has a cautious air
     about him as he walks toward Todd.  

 FRENCH              Hello, Todd.  

 TODD              Mr. French, what brings you to the wild side
             of town?  

     The two of them are standing on opposites sides of the car.  
     French pulls a folded newspaper page from his pocket.  He starts
     to move around the car toward Todd, but Todd circles the other
     way, keeping the car in between himself and French.  

 FRENCH              Todd... I found something troubling in the
             morning news.  Are your parents home?  

 TODD              No.  

 FRENCH              I know the man in this picture is the man who
             came to see me.  

 TODD              It's sort of a bad time right now.  Why don't
             you go home?  

 FRENCH              I will.  But first I need a couple of things
             explained to me.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Richler is speaking to the reporters.  Cameras and lights are in
     his face.  His words are low, serving as a backdrop, but we can 
     tell that he is telling them of the plans to relocate Dussander.
     Weiskopf stands close by...  

 FRENCH (V.O.)              Todd, why don't you tell me what happened?  


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     While Todd almost seems to be enjoying this odd dance around the
     car, French does not.  

 TODD              You know, Mr. French, sometimes one thing
             just leads to another and before you know 
             it... things get out of control.

 FRENCH              I'm afraid that's not much of an answer, 
             Todd.  When do you expect your parents home?  

 TODD              I don't know, Ed.  You want to come in and 
             wait?  I'll put on a pot of tea.  We'll talk
             about old times.  

 FRENCH              I think you might need some help, Todd.
             That's why I'm here.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander is alone in the room as Richler addresses the 
     reporters outside.  His eyes open wide and his movements are the
     liveliest they have been since he was discovered.  He reaches 
     over to his IV unit and begins to disconnect the tube from the
     bag...

 TODD (V.O.)              You know?  You're right.  I do need help.  I
             really do.  


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     Todd becomes more animated, more threatening with every word.
     Somehow it is as though French is now retreating from Todd as
     they circle the car.  

 FRENCH              Let me help you, Todd.  I want to.  You're
             too smart to do anything crazy.

 TODD              Can I ask you something, Ed?  You don't mind
             if I call you Ed, now that I'm out of your
             fucking school, do you?  

 FRENCH              What?  

 TODD              You know all this crap you see on TV about
             forensics... hairs and fibers, that stuff?  
             How much of it do think is true and how much
             is just bullshit?  

     French is puzzled by the question.  He has no answer.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Oh, how would you know?  You're a fucking
             guidance counsellor.

     French stops.  

 FRENCH              Todd, this is silly.  Why don't we go inside?  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Liquid spills onto the floor as the tube comes loose from the
     bag.  Dussander sits back and pulls the free end of the tube up
     to his mouth.  His lips wrap around it and his face tightens as 
     he begins to blow....


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     Todd starts moving again.  French does the same.  

 TODD              Here's a little factoid for ya.  I'll bet you
             didn't know this one.  Hairs fall out of your
             head all the time.  But it's even worse when
             you're nervous.  And you know what?  I've
             been real fucking high-strung lately.  

     Todd comes around the rear of the car and stops at the door to
     the back seat.  He opens it.  

 FRENCH              Listen, Todd... Please.  

     Todd bends down to get something from the back seat.  His voice
     is muffled from the inside of the car.

 TODD              That's how it all happened, you know.  One 
             thing lead to another and before I knew it...

     Todd pops back up holding the rifle, fully assembled and aimed
     at French's chest.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              ...you showed up in my driveway, wearing
             those same fucking sneakers.  

 FRENCH              Whoa.  To--

     Todd rapid-fires.  French's chest explodes red as his lifeless
     body sails back onto the grass.  In the front yard, a dozen
     birds evacuate a tree in a panicked exodus.  Todd swoons back on
     his heels, overcome by something.  But it isn't pain, rather,
     it's a rush of pleasure.  A laugh slips out.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander takes the tube from his mouth and lets it fall to the
     floor.  The camera moves along the tube and stops at Dussander's
     arm, where it ends.  He lies back in his bed and waits...


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     Todd regains his balance.  French stares wide-eyed as Todd steps
     up to him, the muzzle aimed at French's head.  Todd grins
     widely.  For the first time he looks ...happy.

     A single round obliterates half of French's skull.  Todd chokes
     back a giggle like a drunk chokes back a belch.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic, contortive fit as
     the air embolism reaches his heart.  His arm flails against the 
     IV unit, sending it crashing to the floor.  The monitors next to
     him reflect a drastic turn in his condition.  The door flies
     open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of 
     journalists.  Richler and Weiskopf run in and the eager 
     cameramen follow.  The room is bathed in flash explosions as the
     nurses try to subdue Dussander.


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY 
     Todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the
     boxes and boxes of ammunition.  He lets out a beautifully wicked
     laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack.  He
     leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his
     shoulder.


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - STREET - DAY 
     Todd zooms out of the garage on his bike, the rifle slung over
     one shoulder, the backpack over the other.  He zips past
     French's body and out into the street.  In the distance, we hear
     the faint, but rising wail of sirens.  

     A front door or two slams shut as Todd passes.  Suddenly he cuts
     up between two houses.  A man standing in his back yard sees 
     Todd and freezes.  Todd ignores him.  He steers the bike through
     the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times 
     before.


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     From above we see Dussander's eyes, wide open, motionless.  Yet 
     the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction.  A doctor
     pounds on his chest, barks orders.  The trauma team prepares the
     defibrillator, but we know they are too late...


 EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY 
     Todd rides fast over the dry, rocky ground.  The wind streaks
     back his hair.  His excitement is as palpable as the grin
     dancing across his face.  

     An aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail 
     and up a steep embankment.  As the camera moves ahead of him, we
     see the crest of the hill, and beyond it...  

     The freeway, teeming with rush-hour traffic.

                                                          4/25/96 rev.









     FADE IN:

     Through the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of
     small, middle-class houses.  This could be any suburban street
     in America.


     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus.  This is TODD
     BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come.  He stares out at the
     other passengers indifferently.  Then something catches his eye.


     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY

     TITLE: SANTO DONATO, CA  FEBRUARY 1984

     Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an
     unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot.  This is the kind
     of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful
     suburban community of Santo Donato.  Todd gets off his bike and
     heads up the front steps.  On the way, he bends down to pick up
     the L.A. Times.

     Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the
     door bell.  The first reads: "ARTHUR DENKER".  The second reads:
     "NO SOLICITORS, NO PEDDLERS, NO SALESMEN".

     Todd RINGS the bell.  Nothing.  He looks at his watch.  It is
     twelve past ten.  He RINGS again, this time longer.  Still
     nothing.  Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his
     watch as he does so.  After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING,
     a voice is heard from within.

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it
             go!

     Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle.
     Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT
     DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there
     in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth,
     he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein.
     Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly
     cannot.

                          DUSSANDER
                    (continuing)
             A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't
             you read?  I thought all American boys could
             read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day.

     The door begins to close.  Todd waits till the last moment 
     before speaking.

                          TODD 
             Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander. 

     The door stops.  Dussander opens it slowly.  He unlatches the
     screen and slips his fingers around the paper.  Todd does not
     let go.

                          DUSSANDER
             Give me my newspaper. 

                          TODD 
             Sure thing, Mr. Dussander. 

     Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door.
     Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the
     area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's
     bicycle.

                          DUSSANDER 
             My name is Denker.  See?
                    (pointing)
             Denker.  Perhaps you cannot read after all. 
             What a pity.  Good day. 

     As the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.

                          TODD 
             Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. 
             Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44.  Then you
             went to Patin. 

     The door stops, still partly open. 

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires.
             From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and 
             then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know.  No
             one does.  But in 1965, you popped up in West
             Berlin, where they almost got you. 

     The door opens wider. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Listen, boy.  I don't know what is the matter 
             with you.  But I don't have time for this 
             game.  Now, get out of here before I call the
             police. 

                          TODD 
             Call them if you want. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Fine. 

     The heavy door slams shut. 

                          TODD 
             It's okay by me Herr Kommandant.  I'm sure
             the police would love to meet the "Blood-
             fiend of Patin." 

     In a flash the front door is open, so is the screen.  Dussander
     is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled
     umbrella raised to strike him.  Todd stumbles back against the
     porch rail. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You get away from this house, God damn you! 
             I'll beat you all the way home.

     But Todd regains his composure quickly.  He brushes himself off
     and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the
     threat he was a few seconds ago. 

                          TODD 
             After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I
             did.  Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If
             you want to call the cops, go right ahead.
             I'II wait on the steps. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You'll do no such thing. 

                          TODD 
             I won't?  Listen, old man, if I want to start
             screaming right here, I will.  If I want to 
             ride down to the police station and bring the
             cops back myself, then I will.  I will do
             what ever I want.  Do you understand?
                    (pause) 
             But if you like, I could come in for a
             minute.  We could talk. 

     Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER
             I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy
             like you into my home.

     Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Is that what you want, to come into my home?
             So be it.  There is no arguing with crazy
             people.

     Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door.  He
     stops at the threshold of the house and turns.  He is holding
     the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the
     other.  He looks straight ahead.  A moment later, Todd steps
     into the house. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old
     man.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary.  Todd looks
     around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil
     painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle.  But he
     doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of
     a woman sits framed on an end table.

                          DUSSANDER 
             My wife.  She died in 1955 of lung disease.
             At that time I was working at the Menschler
             Motor Works in Essen.  I was heartbroken. 

     Todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a
     lampshade next to the photograph.  He begins to feel it as
     though he were inspecting it for something. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Stop that! 

     Todd jumps back a little but then recovers. 

                          TODD 
             Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the
             lampshades out of human skin?

                          DUSSANDER 
             Now I don't know what you're talking about. 

                          TODD 
             Sure you do, Mr. Dussander. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Denker.  Denker.  Denker.  You don't listen,
             boy.  The television has fried your brain. 

     Pause. 

                          TODD 
             Your hands are shaking. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, they're shaking.  I'm old.  We all 
             shake.  You are most tiresome, and rude.  Now
             if you have a point I wish you'd come to it. 

                          TODD 
             We're in no rush.  If I thought you had 
             plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know
             you don't... 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You know nothing of my business -- 

                          TODD 
             What business?  You sit in that ugly chair
             and watch soap operas all day.  Except on 
             Friday afternoons when you walk down to the 
             movie theater.  And twice a week you take the
             bus downtown to do your shopping.  You always
             use the express lane because you never have 
             more than ten items.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You have been following me?

                          TODD 
             Of course, I followed you.  You think I 
             normally go around to peoples' houses and
             accuse them of being Nazi fugitives? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Perhaps for me you made an exception. 

                          TODD 
             No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt
             Dussander I had to be absolutely certain.
             ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here. 

     Todd sits on the sofa. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Oh, yes, I see now.  As I am this ex-Nazi
             fellow, as you say, then this must be the
             part where I offer you my hidden stash of
             gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish 
             men, of course, which I keep buried in the 
             basement.  Isn't that right, boy?  Well, I'm
             afraid you're wasting your time. I have no 
             money.  If I did I might even give you some
             just to be done with this nonsense. 

                          TODD 
             I don't need money.  You don't have any 
             anyway.  At least, I don't think so.  You
             probably had to spend it all to sneak in the
             country.  A good American passport is 
             expensive on the black market, that I know. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Do you?  Good for you. 

                          TODD 
             Yes, I do.  I know it all, Dussander.  You're
             my One Great Interest. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Your what? 

                          TODD 
             My One Great Interest.  Well, not you 
             personally, but, ...well, it's something I 
             learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher,
             Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our
             One Great Interest in life.  You know, the 
             thing that would really grab us.  Once we did
             that, everything would fall into place.  Like
             hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but 
             collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I
             guess there's no money in that, so she has to 
             be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start
             thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing
             happened.  Until the following summer, in 
             Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found
             it.


     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY

     Todd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in 
     the corner of the garage.  We see that the boxes are filled with
     old war magazines.  Ronny tosses several of them to the ground 
     as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse.  Ronny selects
     one Penthouse and rifles through it.  He discards it a moment
     later. 

                          RONNY 
             One of these has three girls doing it at the
             same time.

     But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention.  He picks one
     up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages.  We
     see a few of the photographs:  Nazi storm troopers, prisoners
     behind barbed wire, the ovens.

                          RONNY (CONT'D) 
             I got it!  Check this out. ...Todd, look. 

                          TODD 
             Hang on a sec. 

     As young Todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes
     in...

                          TODD (CONT'D) 
             It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd 
             never seen, stuff they never put in the books
             anymore, especially the ones they give us to
             read.  And here were stacks of them. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Todd speaks excitedly.  Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges
     him.

                          TODD 
             It... grabbed me.  It was just like Miss 
             Harmon said.  I couldn't believe it.  But
             there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the 
             ...the way they saluted each other.  But what
             am I telling you for?  You know more about
             this stuff than anybody. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Yes, what are you telling me for? 

                          TODD 
                    (ignoring him) 
             Then last year I wrote my big term paper on 
             Dachau.  I got an A+.  It was the only A+ she
             gave.  I mean I always do real well.  A's on
             everything.  That's why I'm accelerated. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Accelerated? 

                          TODD 
             You know, accelerated.  I skipped two grades,
             second and ninth.  I didn't need them.
             That's why I'm already a junior. 

     Dussander sits. 

                          DUSSANDER
             I see...

                          TODD 
             Some kids resent me for it.  That's not 
             important.  Anyway, my paper really floored
             my history teacher.  I guess because I got 
             through all those books without throwing up.
             But I learned something.  I learned that when
             you talk about the camps now, you have to 
             remember to sound really disgusted.  I mean,
             you can't just say what happened like the
             magazines did and leave it at that.  If I 
             tried that the teacher would have freaked and
             called my parents in. 


     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DUSK

     Todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old
     magazines.  The door to the house opens and Ronny, looking
     cross, pokes his head out. 

                          RONNY 
             Todd, your mom's on the phone.  She says you
             have to come home for dinner.  ...Todd? 

     Todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice Ronny
     at first.  Then he looks up at him.  In his eyes is a glint of a
     darkness that we will come to know better. 

                          TODD
             What? 

                          RONNY 
                    (suddenly wary of Todd)
             Your mom's on the phone. 

     ANGLE on Todd. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          TODD 
             Nowadays you have to... soften it. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Why do I care about this?

                          TODD 
             Because, I don't want it softened. 

     Todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. Dussander stares at
     him blankly, unsure of where this is going. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I am sure you trouble your parents to no end. 

                          TODD
             Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's
             what my dad says. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You told your parents about me, then? 

                          TODD 
             You think I'm crazy? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             I think you're crackers, but go on.  I'm
             riveted.

     Todd looks deep into Dussander's eyes.  Dussander is
     uncomfortable.  Slowly, Todd reaches out and brushes his finger
     against Dussander's hand.  Dussander gets up. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             What are you doing? 

     Pause. 

                          TODD 
             And then it happened... I was on my way to
             the library.  It was raining... 


     FLASHBACK: INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     Todd's voice narrates what we are seeing.  Todd, seated near the
     back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard.  Todd thinks
     nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take
     his eyes off him.  Todd is trying to place the old man's face in
     his mind... 

                          TODD (V.O.)
             You climbed on the bus and started this slow
             walk down the aisle.  Just like you were 
             examining a new batch of inmates.  I don't
             think anybody gave you a second glance but 
             me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out
             of your way.  And under your arm you carried
             a rolled up umbrella.  But what really did 
             it, what really set me off was the coat.  You
             were wearing this long black rain coat.  My
             mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of
             you taken at Patin.  You in your S.S. 
             greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          TODD 
             It was incredible. 

     Dussander stares back at him flatly. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             All of this... because of a rain coat? 

                          TODD 
             Well, it wasn't that easy.  I mean, I had to
             really check up on it.  And every picture of
             you in those books is forty years old, at 
             least.  I went back to the library to find 
             the picture.  And then I matched it with the
             photos I took.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You took photographs of me? 

                          TODD 
             Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right
             in the palm of my hand.

                          DUSSANDER 
                    (crunches cigarette into ashtray) 
             Clever boy.

                          TODD
             But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed
             real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought
             a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a
             book that tells you what you're supposed to
             look for and then dusted your mailbox while
             you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You... put dust on my mailbox?  For 
             fingerprints?  You took photographs of me? 
             What else did you do?... I don't believe any
             of this. 

                          TODD 
             I already had a copy of your fingerprints. 
             They're on your want sheet from the Israeli
             government.  It's on database at UC Irvine.
             Can you believe that? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Bourbon. 

     He storms toward the kitchen and stops. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             Would you care for a drink, boy? 

                          TODD 
             Sure, you got a Coke? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             No Kok. 

                          TODD
             Milk? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Milk. 

     Dussander disappears into the kitchen.  Todd stands alone in the
     living room. 

     He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time 
     the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has
     been putting up for Dussander.  He knows he has crossed into
     dangerous territory from which there is no going back.  But 
     after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The
     sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes
     a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear
     him in the kitchen. 

                          TODD 
             It takes eight good matches, they're called 
             compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get 
             accepted in court. 

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             Is that right? 


     FLASHBACK: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY

     Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly.  He pulls
     the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the
     mailbox for prints. 

                          TODD (V.O.)
             Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The 
             first I figured were the mailman's.  Once I 
             knew what I was looking for, yours were easy
             to spot. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)
             You should be a detective. 

     The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the 
     kitchen.  Drinks being poured.  Todd begins to move slowly
     toward the kitchen. 

                          TODD 
             Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it. 


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY

     He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks. 

                          TODD 
             I found fourteen compares. 

     Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass
     of bourbon.  He hands the tumbler to Todd, who brings it up to
     his lips and hesitates. 

                          TODD (CONT'D)
             You have some. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Good Gott.

     He snatches the cup and swallows twice. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee
             Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a
             smiling cow. 

     Todd pauses and then begins to drink. 

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
                    (more to himself than Todd)
             ...And two missing children.
                    (pause) 
             Boy what you have done, I have to explain
             this to you because clearly you don't
             understand, what you have done is a
             violation. 

                          TODD
             A violation? 

                          DUSSANDER
             Yes. 

                          TODD 
             Kind of like those experiments with the
             decompression chamber.  Now, that was a
             violation, Dussander. 

                          DUSSANDER
             That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand
             it. 

                          TODD 
             You what? 

                          DUSSANDER
             I demand -- 

                          TODD 
             You demand nothing from me.  Ever.  Get it?

     Pause. 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for 
             the last time.  My name is Arthur Denker.  It
             has never been anything else.  It has never
             even been Americanized.  If you must know,
             and apparently you must, I was named by my
             father who greatly admired the stories of
             Arthur Conan Doyle.  I did serve in the 
             reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, 
             when I was first married, I supported Hitler.
             I supported him most, I suppose, because for
             the first time in years there was work and
             there was tobacco. ...Would you like a 
             cigarette? 

                          TODD 
             No.  My dad used to smoke.  Mom made him
             quit.  Now he's addicted to Nicorette...
             that's nicotine gum. 

     Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match
     from a cabinet.  He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd. 

                          DUSSANDER
             Nicotine gum. 

     Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives 
     neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. 
     He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns
     and continues.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) 
             Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, 
             directing phantom armies at the whim of his 
             astrologer.  He even gave his dog, Blondi, a 
             death capsule.  On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment
             surrendered to the Americans.  I remember
             that a private named Gonzales gave me a
             chocolate bar.  I wept. 

     Bored, Todd sinks into a chair at the table.

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             I was interned at Essen where I was treated
             very well.  We listened to the Nuremberg
             trials on the radio and when Goering 
             committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of
             schnaps and got drunk.  When I was released, 
             I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works
             until I retired in 1963.  In 1967 I emigrated
             here, to California, and became a U.S. 
             Citizen.  I am as American as you are.  I 
             vote.  No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no koo-ba.
             And that's it, my whole story.  I hope you're
             satisfied. But if not, it's, as you say, 
             tough shit for you.  Now, you go.  Enough of
             this.

     Dussander points to the door, but Todd remains motionless in his
     chair.

 TODD              That was pretty good.  So much to remember. 
             But I guess it helps when you have forty
             years to practice your story.

 DUSSANDER              Oh, to hell with this and to hell with you. 
             I'm calling the police.  Your father is 
             going to beat your behind when he picks you
             up at the police station. 

 TODD              No.  My parents don't believe in violence. 

 DUSSANDER              Well, they should start.  I'm calling. 

     Dussander steps past Todd and picks up the receiver of the phone
     hanging on the wall above the table.  The boy still sits
     motionless behind him.  Dussander dials a "9", and then, with 
     more difficulty, a "1".  He stands with his finger poised over 
     the final "1".  Tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead.  His
     shoulders drop.  Todd stands up.  Their faces are close
     together. 

 TODD              Hang up the phone. 

 DUSSANDER              This is unforgivable.  Do you know the things
             you're accusing me of? 

 TODD              Do it. 

     Slowly, Dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook.

 DUSSANDER              If you don't want money, what do you want? 

 TODD              I want to hear about it. 

 DUSSANDER              Hear about what? 

 TODD              The camps. Everything.  The experiments. The
             examinations.  All the stuff the writers are
             scared to put in their books because people 
             will think they're sick.  That's what I want,
             ...everything. 

 DUSSANDER              Everything? 

 TODD              Exactly.  And you're going to tell it to me. 

 DUSSANDER              You're a monster. 

 TODD              According to history you're the monster. 

 DUSSANDER              How could you ask me to remember such things?
             I can barely remember to take my heart
             medicine. 

 TODD              You were there.  You did those things.  No
             one can tell it better than you can.  And you
             will tell it, starting today.  Right now.  If
             you don't, I'll tell everyone who you are.  I
             swear it. 

 DUSSANDER              Why should I?  Why should I do any of it? 

 TODD              Because you hung up the phone.  That's why.
             ...And just so you know, just so there is no 
             misunderstanding whatsoever.  Everything I
             have on you, the compares, the want sheet,
             all the photographs, are all in an envelope 
             under my mattress.  I'm going to put it there
             every time I come to see you.  If anything
             happens to me, if I should suddenly 
             disappear, some one will find it.  Believe
             me -- 

 DUSSANDER              That's a foolish thing to do.  What if your 
             mother goes in your room anyway?  What if she
             hires a maid? 

 TODD              You better hope she doesn't.
                    (looking at watch) 
             We're wasting time.  Let's get started.  I
             have to be home for dinner. Today I want to
             hear about the ovens.  How you baked them
             after they were dead... and before. 

     Pause. 

 DUSSANDER                     (to himself)
             A boy... a boy...

 TODD              But before we start, put your teeth in.  You
             look better with your teeth. 


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DUSK 
     It is later the same day.  Todd emerges from the house.  The
     setting sun tells us he has been inside for several hours.  He
     picks up his bike and hops on.  He stops.  He turns to look up
     the street in both directions.  No one.  A moment later he
     pedals off down the street. 


 MAIN TITLES 

 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 
 TITLE: SEPTEMBER 1984 
     A typical high school image.  Rows of students sit listening to 
     a lecture from MR. PROXMIRE, fifties, as he weaves his way
     through the aisles. 

 PROXMIRE              But in 1902, Panama didn't exist.  The 
             country we know as Panama was part of
             Columbia. 

     As the teacher continues to lecture, the camera stops on JOEY,
     17.  On his desk is a folded note. He hands it across the aisle 
     and motions for it to be sent to Todd a few rows over.  The note
     moves across the room, avoiding the meandering teacher, on its
     way to Todd.

 PROXMIRE (CONT'D)              Now the nations of the west knew they needed
             a canal through Central America.  They were
             tired of waiting for their ships to sail 
             around Cape Horn.  This was the new century,
             the age of modernization.  And the U.S. was 
             at the forefront.  Teddy Roosevelt was in the
             White House, looking for any chance to assert
             the might of America.  When Columbia balked
             at the offer made by the U.S. and England, 
             Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off
             the coast of Panama, just sit there, where
             they could be seen from the coast. 

     The FEMALE STUDENT across the aisle from Todd now has the note.
     She whispers to him but he doesn't hear.  Todd is trying to say
     awake with great difficulty.

     The girl extends the note just as Proxmire passes.  He stops,
     turns around, plucks the note from the girl's hand and heads for
     the front of the class. 

 PROXMIRE (CONT'D)              Finally Columbia gave up the territory for 
             about a tenth of its original price.  And as
             Roosevelt would say later, "The U.S. stole
             the Panama canal fair and square."

     Without glancing at it, Proxmire crumples the note and drops it
     into the waste basket by his desk. 


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY 
     It is in between classes.  The denizens of STUDENTS crowd around
     their lockers.  Among them is Todd.  He searches through his
     locker and selects a book.  Suddenly the door SLAMS shut to 
     reveal the face of Joey standing against the lockers.  Todd,
     startled, jumps back. 

 JOEY                     (laughs) 
             Take it easy, Jesus.  It's just me, flinch-
             man. 

 TODD                     (serious)
             Don't do that. 

 JOEY              I got news for you.  You're gonna like it. 

 TODD              Walk with me to French. 

     The two walk down the corridor.

 JOEY              Someone likes you.  Someone good. 

 TODD              Who? 

 JOEY              Well, I heard my sister talking on the phone
             with Lisa Herman, and... well -- 

 TODD              You going to tell me who it is? 

     Two CHEERLEADERS pass them.

 JOEY                     (lowering voice) 
             You didn't hear it from me. 

 TODD              Fine. 

 JOEY              Becky Trask. 

 TODD              Was that so hard? 

 JOEY              So ask her out and the weekend after next you
             can double with me and Vanessa. 

 TODD              What about this weekend? 

 JOEY              I'm already planning on being grounded. 

 TODD              Grounded?  What for? 

 JOEY              Where the hell you been?  Report cards were
             sent out today.  I know that never affects 
             you... 

     They arrive at the door of Todd's classroom as the BELL SOUNDS.

 JOEY (CONT'D)              Shit.  Don't forget what I told you. 

     Joey runs off, leaving Todd looking after him. 


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY 
 TITLE: OCTOBER 1984 
     It is late afternoon.  Dussander sits in a rocking chair facing 
     out into the backyard.  Todd is in the lawn chair off to the
     side.  He has just finished a McDonald's cheeseburger and is 
     about to start another one.  Dussander eats a Big Mac, washing
     it down with bourbon.  A large cat keeps jumping onto 
     Dussander's lap while he is eating.  He brushes it away annoyed. 

 TODD              I've never seen anyone drink bourbon with
             McDonald's before.  ...So, How did the stuff
             get to Patin? 

 DUSSANDER              In railroad cars marked "Medical Supplies." 
             It came in long crates that looked like coffins. 

 TODD              That's fitting.  Was it always Zyklon-B?

     The cat jumps into Dussander's lap again.  He throws it down,
     this time harder.

 DUSSANDER              No, from time to time we would be sent 
             something else.  Experimental gases.  The
             High Command was always interested in 
             improving efficiency.  Once they sent us a
             gas code-named "Pegasus."  A nerve gas. 
             Thank God they never sent it again.  It...

     Todd sits up a little, leaning in. 

 TODD              It what? 

 DUSSANDER              It didn't work very well.  It was quite boring.

 TODD              Bullshit.  You're lying.  What did it do? 

 DUSSANDER              It killed them.  What do you think it did,
             made them walk on water?  It killed them. 

     The cat jumps up a third time.  This time Dussander picks it up
     and tosses it a good six feet.  The animal hits the ground and runs away.

 TODD              Tell me. 
                    (slurps on his Coke)
             Tell me. 

 DUSSANDER              I won't.  I refuse.  Where are my cigarettes? 

     He finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips.  He
     lights it.  Todd watches calmly, giving the old man a moment to
     collect himself, and then... 

 TODD              What did it do? 

 DUSSANDER              It made them dance. 

 TODD              Dance? 

 DUSSANDER              Like Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower
             heads.  After a few seconds the prisoners 
             began to leap about.  Some were screaming.
             Most of them were laughing.  They began to
             vomit and to... to defecate helplessly. 

 TODD              You mean they... they... shit themselves?
             ...Woah. 

     But Dussander ignores him, staring out into the yard as he
     begins to remember more easily. 

 DUSSANDER              They began to twitch all over and make high,
             strange sounds in their throats.  At last
             they collapsed and just lay there on the 
             concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood
             streaming from their noses.  But I lied to
             you, boy.  It didn't kill them.  Either 
             because it wasn't strong enough or because we
             couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long.
             I suppose it was that.  I sent five men in 
             with rifles to end their agonies.  These were
             five men I trusted.  It would have looked bad
             on my record to have wasted so many 
             cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had 
             declared every cartridge a national resource.
             I was always given high marks for efficiency. 

 TODD              Yeah, I bet. 

     Dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap. As
     if his own story has suddenly disgusted him, he balls the food
     up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag. 

 DUSSANDER              How do you eat this crap everyday? 

 TODD              Why didn't you just do the job yourself? You
             carried a gun, didn't you? 

 DUSSANDER                     (incredulous) 
             I was the commandant of the camp.

 TODD              So you never killed anybody? 

 DUSSANDER                     (getting frustrated) 
             The entire world was at war, boy.  People died. 

 TODD              That's not a real answer.  I'm asking about
             you. 

 DUSSANDER              Boy, I was a soldier in a position of power.
             You don't get to be there by selling ...girl
             scout's cookies. 

 TODD              I know what the SS was, Dussander.  Who are
             you talking to?  It was a bunch of dumb, rich
             kids who bought their way into the service so
             they wouldn't have to go fight on the front. 

     Dussander stares at Todd, wanting to say something.  Todd
     shovels a few more fries into his mouth, then looks up and sees
     Dussander eyeing him. 

 DUSSANDER              That's enough for today, boy.  I beg you.
             I'm tired. 

 TODD              Yeah, fine.  That was good story though.  You
             always tell them good, once I get you started. 

     ANGLE on Dussander. 


     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #1: EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

     Dussander is asleep in his bed.  A low groaning sound comes in
     very slowly.  Dussander's eyes open.  He sits up, looks around,
     sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field.  It is
     grassy, but certainly not beautiful.  Something is wrong about 
     this place.

     He stands out of the bed, wearing pajamas.  But it is cold.  He
     takes the sheet and wraps himself in it.  The groaning is
     getting louder, more human.  We have never seen him frightened,
     until now.  He steps a few paces from the bed.  The groans have
     becomes low screams.  There is no where to go.  Slowly, as if he
     knows what he's going to see, he looks down at the ground.  It's
     just grass.  But the human voices are now wailing desperately. 

     His knees buckle, but he tries to fight it.  He reaches his 
     knees and lowers his head toward the ground.  The white sheet
     flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind.  The screams
     are now at a feverish pitch.  His ear is inches from the grass
     and his eyes, marked with unmistakable terror, are wide open
     as...


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Dussander bolts upright in his bed.


 EXT. OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 
     RICHARD (DICK) BOWDEN, 38, is a taller, grayer version of his
     son.  He stands over Todd's shoulder watching him shoot at a 
     paper target.  He still has on a tie from work, but the knot has
     been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up.  Both Dick and
     Todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses.  Dick chews
     gum.  They are alone on the range.

     Todd fires a few rounds from his father's .30-.30.  A strained
     tension exists between the two Bowdens. 

 DICK              You're tight.  Don't hold your breath so long.

 TODD              Forget it.  I can't concentrate. 

     He pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to
     his father.  Dick takes it and begins to reload it for him. 

 DICK              I know your upset.  So am I.  So is your
             mother. 

 TODD              These honors classes... they aren't as easy 
             as I thought they'd be.  I totally admit it,
             I didn't prepare enough.  I'm sorry. 

 DICK              Well, fine, but now is not the time to slack 
             off.  You got a chance to finish at the top of
             your class--

 TODD              Nobody wants that more than I do, Dad.

 DICK              Well you haven't been hitting the books very
             much. 

 TODD              I know... 

 DICK              And seeing as you're not playing soccer this
             year it's not like you don't have enough
             time-- 

 TODD              That still bothers you, doesn't it? 

 DICK                     (with difficulty)
             No, son. If you weren't enjoying it, then
             you shouldn't play.

 TODD              I think it bothers you and you're not telling
             me. 

     Dick decides to take a shot himself.  He readies himself and
     fires. 

 DICK              That was lousy.  Here. 
                    (gives the gun back to Todd) 
             I want to see your grades come up, buddy. 
             That's all that bothers me.  And if you say 
             you need more time to study, then that's what
             we'll do.  The first thing is to cut out all
             the time you spend reading to Mr. Denker. 
             It's a nice thing to do, but it's not helping
             our school work a bit. 

     Dick is looking at his son, unsure if he has just seen a
     contortion of rage on his son's face.  But Todd is cocking the
     rifle and...

 DICK (CONT'D)              Hey, Todd.  You still with me? 

 TODD              Yeah... no.  Dad, don't do that.  Please.
             Don't punish Mr. Denker for something that's
             my fault.  I mean, he'd be lost without me-- 

 DICK              He'll be fine without you. He was fine before
             and he'll be fine after. There's nothing 
             wrong with wanting to help people, but you
             gotta make sure you got yourself squared away
             first. That's what matters. 

     Todd turns to face his father, and speaks to him with a new
     seriousness.

 TODD              Dad, am I like other kids? 

 DICK              Not by a long shot. 

 TODD              Then trust me on this.  Don't lose faith in
             me because I blew a couple of exams.  I will
             get my grades back up.  In fact I've already
             started.  Three days a week I go over to 
             Freddy Tremain's for extra help. He's a wiz
             at trig. But please, Dad, whatever you do, 
             don't punish a helpless old man for something
             that's my fault. 

     Pause. 

 DICK              Did you practice that in front of a mirror or
             something?

     Todd smiles.  Feeling his father caving in, he aims the rifle and 
     squeezes off a round.  Dick keeps his eyes on Todd as he shoots.

 DICK (CONT'D)              Hey, he's not...?

 TODD                     (it takes him a second)
             ...No.

 DICK              Just checking. 
                    (thinks for a moment) 
             All right... We'll give your way a shot. If
             you think you can do it, if you really do,
             and your serious, then... okay. 
             You really like the old guy, don't you?

 TODD              I'm making a difference in somebody's life. 
             It's that simple.

     Todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger.  The gun
     jams.  Todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck. 

 DICK              Okay, okay. 
                    (takes the rifle) 
             Don't ever force it.  Watch. 

     Dick begins to methodically unjam the gun. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DUSK 
 TITLE: NOVEMBER 1984 
     Dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes.  His clothes
     and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal 
     appearance.  He goes to the basement door and, leaning carefully
     over the steps, retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash, stored
     precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement.  He
     comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open.  Todd's
     irritated voice booms in from the living room.

 TODD (O.S.)              Don't get too drunk.  We still have a little
             while. 

     Dussander mumbles contemptuously and then speaks so Todd can
     hear him.

 DUSSANDER              You don't have to do that, you know. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK 
     Todd has built a fire, probably the first fire Dussander's
     fireplace has seen in twenty years.  The room is bathed in a
     warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside.  Todd uses the
     poker to adjust one of the logs. 

 TODD              Screw you.  I'm doing this for me.  This
             place is freezing. 

     Dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy
     chair, which has been positioned in front of the hearth.

 DUSSANDER              Yes, it must be fifty degrees outside.  I'm
             sure to you it seems positively frigid.

 TODD              Why didn't you pay your gas bill?

 DUSSANDER              It slipped my mind.  I will attend to it
             tomorrow. 

 TODD              Slipped your mind.  I noticed it didn't slip
             your mind to stock up on a new case of
             bourbon. 

 DUSSANDER              Leave me alone. 

     Todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet
     away.

 TODD              All right, so finish your story, because I'm
             still not clear.  You cook up this stew, and
             you bring the prisoner in, and you let them
             smell it, and suddenly they tell you
             everything? 

 DUSSANDER              Oh, don't misunderstand me.  Certainly with a
             pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner 
             would tell us everything we wanted to know, 
             sometimes more.  But mine was a much more ...
             elegant method.  Remember, it had been months
             since they had smelled real potatoes
             simmering over an open flame, and boy, when
             that delicious odor hit their noses their
             mouths would drop and out would pour an
             account of every minor infraction their
             friends had committed, I mean it was
             magnificent...

 TODD              And you let them eat the soup? 

 DUSSANDER              Oh, we never promised them the soup in 
             exchange for information.  We never mentioned
             it at all. 

     Pause.  Todd is impressed. 

 TODD              Wow, that's really good, Dussander.  I mean
             that's...
                    (pointing)
             that's thinking. 

     Dussander does not respond.  He gazes deeply into the fire.

 DUSSANDER              ...But, as the war pressed on, the time for
             such civilized measures became a luxury.  I
             remember by April of '45, we had barely
             enough food to feed ourselves.  The sound of
             the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but
             still, the train cars from France and Poland
             kept coming.  This was a time of desperation.
             The ovens burned day and night and still I
             knew we would not beat the arrival of the
             Russian forces.  Many of my men, the cowardly
             ones, deserted during the night.  But the men
             that remained, the same ones I had called
             upon so many times, ...continued the work.
             At first we thought a massive fire in the
             main building would serve our purpose.  We
             could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch
             up to each of the windows.  But with so many
             of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would
             burn properly.  We needed something
             ...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I
             shall never forget his enthusiastic smile,
             pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the
             Western gate which had been used during
             construction.  How perfectly simple it was.
             The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four
             meters deep, down the center of the camp.
             For two hours they dug until I realized we
             may not have enough gas to finish the job.
             So the inmates were given shovels and told
             they were building a shelter from the
             incoming artillery.  When they were done, I
             immediately called for a practice drill and
             three thousand naked bodies began to march
             into the trench.  It took less than twenty
             minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the
             bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit
             sending the piles of earth into the massive
             grave.  Those who tried to free themselves
             were shot, of course, but very few cartridges
             were wasted that day.  The machines were too
             fast.  Back and forth they went... packing
             the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of
             gas and my men had to scurry along with
             shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I
             gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance
             the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like
             an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that
             no matter what happened, ...no one would ever
             forget what we did here.

     Dussander stares into the fire.  Todd, wide-eyed, is locked on
     Dussander when...

     The PHONE RINGS.

     They look at each other, a bit puzzled.  Clearly, it does not
     ring very often, and when it does, Dussander cannot help but be
     apprehensive.

     It rings again.  Dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen,
     Todd watches him go. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Hello? 
                    (Pause. Then with apprehension) 
             Yes? ...No, no trouble at all. ...Yes.
             ...Yes, he's here. ...I see.
                    (his face softens) 
             ...Really? ...No, no plans. ...Ah, lovely. 
             ...My dear, I'd be delighted. ...Certainly.
             ...Of course I will. ...Yes, until then.
             ...All right. ...Good-bye. 

     He hangs up and turns to Todd with a odd grin. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              It seems I am to be your guest for
             Thanksgiving dinner.


 INT. OLD TOYOTA CAR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
     Todd and Becky are in the backseat of Becky's car.  They are on
     a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the
     lights of their town.  At 16, BECKY TRASK, is an attractive girl
     who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes
     them.  They are kissing in the back seat.  MUSIC plays on the
     stereo.  Becky's blouse is unbuttoned.  She stops kissing Todd. 

 BECKY              Is everything all right? 

 TODD              Yeah, I'm fine. 

     Becky smiles to herself, unconvinced. 

 BECKY              You're nervous.  I think it's sweet. 

 TODD              No... No, I'm cool. 

 BECKY              Do you want me to do something else? 

     Todd just stares at her.  He doesn't know what he wants.  Becky
     decides for him.  She slides down out of the frame.  Todd is
     startled at first, but lets her.  After a moment, he closes his
     eyes. 


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - NIGHT 
     Dussander sits in his rocking chair.  A small blanket drapes
     across his lap.  He smokes a cigarette and holds a near-empty
     glass.  On the ground beside him, there is a small bowl.

 DUSSANDER              Here kitty-kitty.  Here kitty-kitty. 

     Out in the yard, the large cat emerges from the darkness and
     moves across the grass.  It sees Dussander and, more 
     importantly, the bowl next to him.  We see that the bowl is
     filled with milk. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Come, puss-puss.  That's right.  I'll wait. 

     Dussander sits perfectly still.  Cautiously, the cat moves
     toward the porch. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              That's right, puss-puss.  You can smell it
             now, can't you? 

     The cat creeps to the edge of the steps.  It takes them one at a
     time.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              That's right, kitty-kitty.  That's right.

     After a moment the cat edges up to the bowl.  Its tail twitches
     nervously.  Finally, it begins to lick up the milk.  Dussander
     crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass.  His movements
     are slow and patient.  From under the blanket he pulls a pair of
     yellow rubber gloves.  He begins to put them on.  The cat jumps
     back for a moment.  Dussander freezes.  He waits the cat out. 
     Soon the animal is back at the bowl.  Dussander continues with
     the gloves.  He watches the cat's tail.  As the animal gets
     comfortable, its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair.
     Dussander slams the chair back.  The CAT SHRIEKS.  Dussander
     flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight,
     squirming, HISSING bundle.  He stands out of the chair. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Gotcha. 


 INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
     It is later.  Becky sits behind the wheel.  Todd is next to her.
     A different song is on the RADIO.  They sit for a moment in
     silence, clearly uncomfortable. 

 TODD              I'm sorry. 

 BECKY              It's all right.  Maybe you'll be more in the
             mood later. 

 TODD              I don't know.  That's never happened before. 

     Becky lights a joint.  She takes a puff and exhales toward Todd.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Can you blow that the other way? 

 BECKY              Maybe you don't like me. 

 TODD              No, I do. 

 BECKY                     (exhaling out the window)
             Maybe you don't like girls. 

     For a moment it is as though Todd's face were purple with rage.
     But a moment later the expression is gone.  Todd turns away.
     Becky sees that her comment has hurt him. 

 BECKY (CONT'D)              That was a lousy thing for me to say.  I'm
             sorry, honey.

     She kisses him on the cheek.  He nods reluctantly. 

 TODD              Let's just go home. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander bursts through the door with the bundle.  A single paw
     emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at Dussander, 
     clawing him across the neck.

 DUSSANDER              Oww, you mother-fucker. 

     They move across the room to the stove.  With difficulty,
     Dussander pulls open the oven door, revealing the glowing red
     interior.  The animal SCREAMS and claws at Dussander's neck and
     arms, escaping more and more from the blanket with every 
     gyration of its body.  With a mighty shove Dussander plunges the
     cat toward the opening, but the animal braces its paws on the
     edge of the stove.  The two are deadlocked.  But Dussander's 
     hands are too close to the heat.  He screams.  His grip loosens
     just enough.  With a desperate cry, the animal charges up
     Dussander's body, over his head, and leaps to the floor.
     Dussander dives after it. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Come here! 

     But the animal is too swift.  In a second, it is atop the
     counter and out the open window above the sink.  Although
     defeated and exhausted, Dussander cannot contain his excitement.
     His panting gives way to a twisted, hearty laugh. 


     TODD'S DAYDREAM: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

     This is a 1940's laboratory.  Todd is in his boxer shorts.
     Dussander is next to him, wearing a lab coat and his S.S.
     officers hat.  Todd looks down on the examination table.  A
     YOUNG GIRL, about 16, is held to the table with clamps.  She is 
     naked, staring at Todd.  Behind the table is a glass window and 
     behind that is another room where OTHER SCIENTISTS are
     monitoring equipment.

     Over Dussander's methodical voice, Todd's dream shows flashes of
     what is being done: some sort of sexual experiment on the girl. 

 DUSSANDER                     (to other scientists) 
             Test run eight-four.  Electricity, sexual 
             stimulus, metabolism.  Based on the Thyssen
             theories of negative reinforcement. 

     Dreamlike SOUNDS and images pass before us: Todd's breathing,
     the girl's cry, electrical equipment, naked flesh, maybe
     Todd's, maybe the girl's. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Subject is a young Jewish girl, approximately 
             sixteen years of age, no scars, no
             identifying marks, no known disabilities -- 

     Inside the control room, a SCIENTIST monitors a volt meter, 
     calling out the readings as Dussander yells for the voltage to
     be increased.  As the meter rises, the girl SCREAMS more 
     violently.  Perhaps her eyes roll back, her tongue flutters in 
     her mouth.  Through all of this, the scientists call out and the
     record heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, voltage, etc.
     Todd's eyes close.  His breathing accelerates as does the motion
     of his hips until... 


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 
     Todd snaps out of his daydream.  His trigonometry class is
     having an examination.  He sits at his desk, staring blankly at
     the paper before him.  Most of the answer spaces are empty.  He
     knows he is going to fail another test. 


 EXT. OUTOOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 
     Todd is blasting away, rapid-firing the rifle down range at an
     unfortunate paper target.  The protective headphones lay on the
     counter beside him, as does his backpack.  He stops shooting
     when a voice snaps over the P.A. speaker next to him. 

 VOICE (O.S.)              You, on lane twelve.  You need to have your 
             headgear on at all times. (click) And no
             rapid firing.

     Todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small
     booth.  Todd puts on the headgear, and after a moment, the man 
     goes back to reading a newspaper.  Todd looks up and down the 
     range.  One or two other shooters are concentrating on their 
     targets.  Todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the 
     man in the booth.  He snaps off a single dry round.  Todd smiles
     weakly at the sound of the click.  Unnoticed by anyone, he turns
     back toward the target, strangely comforted.


 INT. DINING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY 
     Thanksgiving dinner.  All the Bowden's are there, including
     Dick's parents, VICTOR and AGNES. Dussander sits at the head of 
     the table, Todd next to him.  The family has finished dinner and
     is having coffee.  Dick and his father smoke cigars.  Todd's 
     mother, MONICA BOWDEN, still pretty at 36, pours Dussander some
     more coffee. 

 MONICA              Todd loved that dog.  A lot more than Dick 
             did. 

 DICK              We all loved that dog. 

 AGNES              I remember when you had to put it down, Todd
             cried for two weeks.  Just about broke my
             heart. 

 DUSSANDER              Excuse, me, Mrs. Bowden.  Put it down?  I've
             been here over twenty years but that's a new
             one. 

 VICTOR              Means put it to sleep, Victor.

     Dussander still looks puzzled.  He looks to Todd, but Victor
     jumps in.

 VICTOR (CONT'D)              Well, it's how they kill it, Arthur. They do
             it all the time at the pound, ...sick dogs,
             dogs nobody wants.

 MONICA              It's very humane.

 DUSSANDER              I see. 

     Todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others don't notice.

 MONICA              Some more pie? 

 DUSSANDER              As my departed wife used to say, 'One must
             never overdo the sublime.' 

 AGNES              It was delicious, Monica. 

 VICTOR              Tell me, Arthur, if you don't mind me asking.
             What did you do during the war? 

 AGNES              Now don't get too personal, Victor. 

     A quick moment between Todd and Dussander.

 DUSSANDER              I was a student at the University until my
             reserve unit was called in 1943.
                    (notices Victor) 
             But we were not a combat unit, thank God.
             Mechanical engineers.  Help me find my 
             cigarettes, Todd.  Would you?  In those days,
             not even the call of higher learning could
             exempt an able body from military service.

     Dussander's cigarettes are right in front of him.  Todd fetches
     one and, bringing it to his own lips, lights it for him.

 MONICA              Todd Bowden!

 DUSSANDER                     (laughs knowingly) 
             My dear, I do apologize.  My hands are too
             arthritic to strike a match, I'm afraid. 
             Your son has been good enough to help an old
             man with his filthy habits. 

 MONICA              Well...as long as you don't inhale. 

 TODD              Cigarettes are gross, Mom. 

 VICTOR              Well, Victor, you were doing your part like
             we all were, I suppose.  Of course, if you 
             were in the Pacific Fleet I'd have to shoot
             you. 

     Everyone laughs, except Todd.

 DICK                     (to Dussander) 
             My dad is very proud of the fact that the
             Bowden men have hit every major conflict
             since the Civil War. 

 VICTOR              That's right.  Dickie served two tours in 
             Vietnam.  Earned a bronze star and a purple
             heart. 

 DICK              It's one family tradition I'd like to put an
             end to.  Todd and I blow a few caps down at 
             the range every week.  That's all the combat
             he needs.

 TODD                     (perking up, offended) 
             What's that supposed to mean? 

 DICK              Forget it. 

 DUSSANDER                     (looking at Todd) 
             Perhaps your son would excel in combat. 

 MONICA              Todd could excel at anything.  Right, honey?

     Todd doesn't answer.  His eyes are still on Dick.  Dick notices
     him. 

 AGNES                     (getting up, starts to clear some
                    dishes) 
             Oh, let's don't even talk about this. I can't
             stand to think of you boys fighting another
             war.

 DUSSANDER              The Purple Heart.  You were injured? 

 TODD              He was knocked unconscious and woke up in a
             hospital.

     A long pause.  Dick is embarrassed and offended by Todd's stab.
     He puffs on his cigar.  Agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks
     up some more dishes.  Dick stands suddenly to help her.

 DICK              Mom, let me get that for you. 


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SIDEWALK - NIGHT 
     Todd and Dussander walk together in silence.  Todd is clearly in
     a bad mood.  Dussander prods him.

 DUSSANDER              You shouldn't be so hard on your father. 

 TODD              Why don't you mind your own business. 

 DUSSANDER                     (amused at Todd's short fuse) 
             Boy, It's not so easy to raise children. Your
             father does the best he can, I'm sure. Having 
             his own father there is bound to cause some
             anxiety on his part-- 

 TODD              Oh, give me a frigging break, will you?  Look
             who's talking to me, for Christ's sake.  And
             what was that crap about the dog?  If you 
             were any more charming I was going to puke. 

 DUSSANDER              Heavens, boy, wasn't that precisely the 
             point?  I used the evening to our advantage. 

 TODD              Our advantage?  Our advantage?

 DUSSANDER              Certainly now they will offer no objections 
             if you continue to come over and read to me. 

 TODD              You sure take a lot for granted.  Do you 
             think there's anybody forcing me to come over
             to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up
             booze all day?  Do you? 

 DUSSANDER              Lower your voice.  People will hear. 

 TODD              So what?

     Dussander stops. 

 DUSSANDER              No, nobody forces you to come.  In fact, you
             are welcome to stay away.  Believe me, boy, I
             have no scruples about drinking alone.  None
             at all.

     They start walking again.  Dussander turns up his driveway.
     Todd follows.

 TODD              You know, if they found out what you are,
             they'd spit on you. 

 DUSSANDER              I am sure they would have nothing but 
             revulsion for me.  But what would they say
             about you, boy, when I told them you had 
             known about me for nine months... and said
             nothing? 

     Dussander unlocks his door and steps in.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Come and see me if you please, and stay home
             if you don't.  Good night, boy.

     He closes the door. 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
 TITLE: DECEMBER 1984 
     Todd places a brightly wrapped Christmas present on the table in
     front of Dussander, who looks at it skeptically. 

 TODD              Go ahead, open it.  Wait, I better pull down
             the shades, first. 

 DUSSANDER              What for? 

 TODD              Just to be safe. 

 DUSSANDER                     (getting up) 
             To hell with this.  You open it. 

 TODD              Oh, relax, old man.  Sit down and open it. 

     Todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of Coke.
     Dussander slowly sits back down. 

 DUSSANDER              You wrapped it yourself, I see. 

     He begins to remove the bow, and then the paper.  He moves very
     cautiously, as if the package might explode at any moment.

     Finally, he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one
     of fear to one of exasperation. 

 TODD              Merry Christmas!

     We see that the box contains a replica of an officer's S.S. 
     uniform, complete with hat and jackboots.  Dussander reads the
     label.

 DUSSANDER              Pete's Quality Costume Clothiers - Serving 
             You Since 1976.

 TODD              Go ahead, try it on. 

 DUSSANDER              Are you out of your mind, boy?  What makes 
             you think I would put something like that on? 

 TODD              I thought you'd like it --

 DUSSANDER              Like it?  My God, you're a bigger fool than I
             thought.  Maybe I'll put it on and do a 
             little shopping downtown.  Is that what you
             thought?  You stupid, boy. 

 TODD              Don't call me stupid. 

 DUSSANDER              You... You know, you are correct.  I am the 
             stupid one.  For months I have suffered your
             indignities.  I have exposed my past to you 
             while watching you stuff your face with those
             wretched hamburgers.  I have stocked my 
             refrigerator with Coca Cola and ding dongs. 
             All for you, I have done these things and I'm
             tired of it.  But because I value my life and 
             my freedom, what's left of it anyway, I do
             them.  But I'll die before I put this thing
             on, you fucking piss-ant. 

 TODD              That's enough.  You don't get to talk to me
             like that. 

     Dussander bangs the table.

 DUSSANDER              I should smash you. 

 TODD              Do it.  Please.
                    (pause) 
             Indignities?  What you've suffered with me is
             nothing compared to what the Israelis would
             do to you.  Remember what happened to 
             Eichmann?  You forget that, I think.  And,
             you know, that's my fault.  I have let you
             forget.  You have gotten comfortable with
             this situation.  Well, don't you for one 
             minute ever forget who holds the cards here.
             Don't you ever forget that envelope under my 
             mattress.  I tried to do this the nice way, I
             tried to do something to please you, but you 
             don't want it.  So fine, we'll do it the hard
             way.  You will put this on because I want to 
             see you in it.  Now strip.

 DUSSANDER              I hope you go to hell -- 


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     It is five minutes later.  Dussander stands in the uniform.  He
     looks at it indignantly.

 DUSSANDER              The insignia is all wrong.  The boots should
             be leather, not imitation. 

 TODD              That suit cost me over eighty bucks... with
             the boots. 

 DUSSANDER              And this material... what?  Polyester? 

 TODD              Quiet.  Straighten that hat. 

     Dussander ignores him.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Straighten that hat, soldier!

 DUSSANDER              Good Gott. 

     Dussander does what he is told. 

 TODD              Actung!

     Slowly Dussander straightens up.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Now, march... Do it!

     Dussander begins to move his feet in place. 

 TODD (CONT'D)              That's it.  March.

     Dussander has gotten into a rhythm, marching faster in place.

 TODD (CONT'D)              About face.

     Dussander spins sharply on his heels.  He continues to march.

 TODD (CONT'D)              About face. 

     Dussander is stomping in place vigorously.  He spins on command,
     facing Todd.  He gives a Nazi salute.  Todd watches him march
     for a moment.  At first he enjoys the domination, but as 
     Dussander gets caught up in the marching, Todd's expression changes. 

 TODD (CONT'D)              Okay, that's enough. 

     Dussander is still marching furiously. 

 TODD (CONT'D)              I said that's enough! 

     Suddenly Dussander stops.  He collapses into a chair, exhausted.
     He sits there panting for a moment. 

 DUSSANDER              Boy... be careful. You play with fire. 


     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #2: INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Dussander wakes to a strange, faint rumble.  He climbs out of
     bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound.
     We follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed.
     Soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his
     room.  Yet he is still in darkness, as if his room has suddenly
     ended and continues into a black void.

     But the rumble gets louder, more mechanical sounding.  As the
     sound crescendoes we see what Dussander sees.  A train car.
     Steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a
     complete stop in the night.

     Dussander stares at the boxcar coldly, and we realize that
     something is staring back at him.  Eyes, dozens of them, glare
     back at him from between the slatted boards of the train.  Some
     are low to the flooe, like those of children.  Others are
     higher.  Dussander snaps at them in German.

 DUSSANDER                     (in German)
             Come out. ...Come out, now!

	 No one exits the train.  Yet, the eyes seem to move around
     cautiously within the boxcar.  Dussander is getting angry.  His
     orders aren't being carried out.  Suddenly the door of the train
     slides open.  But still only the eyes are visible.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)                     (in German)
             Line up in front of the train. Now!

     Again, no one gets off.  Enraged, Dussander takes a few steps
     toward the train.  In a flash the eyes charge at him.  But these
     are not the eyes of prisoners.  These are wolves.  Dussander can
     only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend
     upon him.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Dussander wakes from his nightmare in a cold sweat. His pajamas
     are soaked. Disoriented and out of breath, he climbs out of bed
     and clicks on the light.

     The closet. He stares at the closed closet door for a moment and
     then moves toward it slowly. He opens the door and runs his
     fingers across the assortment of shirts and jackets. His hand
     stops near the back.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER 
     Dussander is seated on the side of the bed smoking a cigarette.
     He is dressed, with the exception of the boots and hat, in the 
     SS uniform.  He appears calmer, less agitated.  He crunches out
     the cigarette and slips under the covers.  He turns off the
     light.  He closes his eyes.  For the moment, he is at peace.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY 
     Todd stands facing his open locker.  He is staring at his report
     card.  Sweat collects on his forehead.  He looks like he is 
     about to explode.  He wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns
     around to see if anyone notices him.  TWO STUDENTS catch his 
     eye.  They are both Asian.  They are smiling and pouring over 
     each other's report cards.  Todd zips open his backpack, giving
     us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside.  He
     throws the report card in and zips up the bag.  Slinging the bag
     over his shoulder, he slams the locker shut and heads off down
     the hall.


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY 
     Todd is shooting baskets with Joey.  It is after school.  Todd
     wears a white T-shirt.  Off to the side, we see the dress shirt
     he was wearing earlier and his school bag.  

 JOEY              So what are you going to do? 

 TODD              Fuck if I know.  

     Todd throws up a clumsy shot.  It misses.  

 JOEY              You're throwing it flat.  Let it roll off
             your fingers more.  

 TODD                     (snapping at him)
             I don't need a lesson.  

     Todd adjusts his grip on the ball anyway.  He shoots again.  No
     good.  

 JOEY              Your dad, man.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm a
             fuck up.  My dad is used to this crap from 
             me.  

     Todd does not respond to his friend's attempt at humor.   He is
     slamming the ball around with great force.  He bounces it hard
     off the back wall to give himself a rebound.  He is mumbling to
     himself.  

 JOEY              What? 

 TODD              What? 

 JOEY              You said something? 

 TODD              No.

 JOEY              You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  It's not
             the first time I've noticed it.  What is 
             going on with you?

 TODD              Nothing, Joey.  I fucked up.  I'II fix it.  
             I'II fix it.  

 JOEY                     (hurt) 
             All right, man.  Whatever you say.  Look, I
             got to get to practice.  

     No response from Todd.  

 JOEY (CONT'D)              If you need to talk, you can call me.  You
             know that.  I'II see you around.  

     Joey walks off.  Todd continues shooting the ball.  

 TODD                     (mumbling) 
             You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  You're
             talking to yourself, Bowden.  

     He throws up a shot.  It is good.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              I'II fix it.  I'II fix it.  

     A strange SQUAWKING sound is heard.  Todd doesn't hear it at
     first, but as the sound grows louder Todd stops the ball and 
     looks around.  His eyes focus on the area near an open doorway.
     Sunlight streams into the empty gym.  Todd walks closer, seeing
     that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled 
     in from outside.  He goes up to it.  The bird is black.  Its 
     wing is damaged.  It SQUAWKS loudly, looking up at Todd.  Todd
     begins mumbling again.  He starts to dribble the ball 
     thoughtlessly.  As his words become clearer, the bouncing gets
     harder.

 TODD (CONT'D)              I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  

     Todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him.  The bird
     continues to SCREAM.  Slowly the ball drifts from beside Todd to
     in front of him, gaining force with every bounce.  He brings it
     up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his
     might.  When it comes back up, it is smeared with blood.  He
     throws it down again, this time it comes up with feathers
     smeared in the blood.  The squawking has stopped.  Blood
     splatters on Todd's shirt.  His eyes close.  

     He stops the ball, looks around.  No one has seen him.  He 
     notices his shirt.  Calmly, he tears it off, wraps the ball in
     it, and tosses it in a nearby trash can.  


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 
     Todd pedals his bike through town, carrying a brown paper bag 
     under one arm.  He turns down Dussander's street.  He stops in
     front of the house and heads for the front door.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     Dussander emerges from the basement just as Todd comes into the
     kitchen.  Todd sniffs the air, frowns.  

 TODD              What the fuck happened in here?

 DUSSANDER              Ah, boy...  I burned my TV dinner, I'm afraid.  

 TODD              Something's come up.  Sit down.  

     Dussander's studies Todd for a moment.  Although Todd appears
     calm, his tone reflects a somber, business-like attitude.

 DUSSANDER              I see.  
                    (sits at table) 
             What seems to be the trouble? 

     Todd sets his grade card and the envelope on the table.
     Dussander picks up the grade card and examines it.  

 DUSSANDER              Quarterly Progress Report.
                    (he reads silently) 
             You seem to have fallen on the rocks, my boy.
             One B, three C's and a D.  Hardly the work of
             a "National Merit Scholar," or whatever you
             call yourself.  

 TODD              This isn't a joke, Dussander.  I can't blame
             this on teachers or honors classes anymore.  

 DUSSANDER              Looks like you have a problem then.  

 TODD              I have a problem?  You still don't get it.  
             I'm out of excuses.  Do you know what's going
             to happen when my dad sees that?  He's going 
             to hit the fucking roof.  He'll get it all
             out of me.  The truth, you...everything.  

 DUSSANDER              Boy, it's not my fault your grades have 
             fallen.  

 TODD              Don't be so sure.  

     Dussander throws Todd a dismissive wave.  He gets up to get a drink 

 DUSSANDER              Please, you don't spend that much time here.
             I hardly think--

 TODD                     (quickly, as if confessing something) 
             I can't study anymore. 

     Pause.  Dussander looks at him oddly, a bit surprised.  But then
     opens the cabinet and pulls out a glass, allowing Todd to continue.  

 TODD                     (with difficulty) 
             I try.  But it's...  different now.  I sit in 
             front of my books and start thinking about...
             about corpses, and electrified fences and
             people getting strangled with piano wire.  
             All that crap you tell me.  The next thing I
             know it's after midnight.  I sit in class 
             like a zombie, ...useless.  But that's not
             the half of it.  Check out the letter.  

     Dussander goes back to the table and picks up the envelope.  He
     opens it.

 DUSSANDER                     (reading letter) 
             'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden, this note is to
             suggest that we have a group conference 
             concerning Todd's first semester grades.  In
             light of his previous good work in this
             school, the sudden deterioration in his
             grades suggest a specific problem which
             should be addressed before his academic 
             advancement is jeopardized permanently.  Such
             a problem can often be solved by a frank and
             open discussion.  I am ready to work out a 
             time for us to meet.  In a case such as this,
             earlier is usually better.  Sincerely yours,
             Edward French.'  Who is this Edward French,
             the headmaster? 

 TODD              French?  Fuck no.  He's a stupid guidance
             counselor.

 DUSSANDER              Guidance counselor?  What is that? 

 TODD              He guides and he counsels.  You read the
             fucking note.  Do you realize I could have to
             go to summer school?  Me, in there with all
             those fuck-ups.  I do not want to go to
             summer school.  

 DUSSANDER              Or to the reformatory.  

 TODD              What did you say? 

 DUSSANDER              Boy, ...you have a far greater problem than
             your school grades.  Before you speak to me
             about what they will "get out of you", 
             remember the facts. ...Seventy thousand 
             people died at Patin.  Have you forgotten 
             that?  To the world at large I am the most 
             despicable of criminals, a monster.  Do you 
             think I would stand aside and let you turn me
             in so easily?  Without a fight?  Is your 
             American self-confidence so bloated that you 
             have never once realized you are an accessory 
             to my crimes.  You have criminal knowledge of 
             an illegal alien, and have not reported it. 
             Don't you see that?  And if I'm caught, I 
             will tell the world all about you.  When the 
             reporters put their microphones in my face it
             will be your name I'll repeat over and over
             again.  Todd Bowden, yes that's his name.  
             How long?... oh, for months, almost a year.
             He wanted to know everything...  That's how
             he put it, yes - everything.  

 TODD              They'd never believe you.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's a gamble.  How
             would you explain all those books you were
             reading to me?  My eyes are not what they 
             were but I can still read fine print.  I can
             prove it.

 TODD              So what? I'd say you tricked me.  

 DUSSANDER              Why would I do that?

 TODD              For friendship, because you're lonely and had
             no one in your life.  No jury would take your
             word over mine.  A Nazi?  Forget it.  Just 
             get it out of your head.  You can't threaten
             me and you can't scare me.  What you can do
             is find me a pencil.  

 DUSSANDER              A pencil, what for? 

     Todd sets the small paper bag on the table.  Dussander opens it
     and removes a small bottle.  The label reads: "ink eradicator."
     He also removes an x-acto knife and a few sheets of rub-off
     letters.  

 TODD              That will take care of the report card, I 
             think.  About that fucking letter, I don't
             know.  

     Todd sits down at the table.  He takes the bottle from Dussander
     and examines the report card.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Fuck...  come on, a pencil.  A sharp one.  
             With an eraser.  

     Dussander pauses.  He knows Todd is right.  Slowly, he goes to 
     the counter and opens a drawer.  He rummages through it as Todd 
     sits with his back to him.  Dussander picks out a pencil with an
     extremely sharp point.  He holds it point out and approaches
     Todd.  He gets closer, the point moves in toward the back of 
     Todd's head.  He holds the point inches from the boy's neck.  He
     deliberates.

 DUSSANDER              Will this do? 

     Todd grabs the pencil.  Dussander turns toward the window.  He
     thinks for a moment.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Tell me, does this French know your parents
             in a social way? 

 TODD              Him?  Fuck, no.  They wouldn't mix with a
             geek like him.  

 DUSSANDER              How about professionally?  Has he ever called
             them before? 

 TODD              No.  I've never needed it.  Why? 

 DUSSANDER              I have an idea.  It will require you to make
             one phone call.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY 
     Kurt Dussander, a.k.a. Arthur Denker, a.k.a. Victor Bowden,
     Todd's grandfather, sits outside an office marked, "Edward
     French - Guidance."  Dussander looks the best he has ever 
     looked.  His hair is clean and combed.  His face is shaved.  And
     he is smartly dressed in his best blue suit.  As he waits, he
     glances down at a piece of paper.  We see that it is a "crib-
     sheet" of Todd's family tree.  Several names appear on the 
     sheet, connected to other names by lines and arrows.  By each
     name is one or two word description, such as "dead: cancer,
     1981" or "divorced, Dallas, Tex."  The door opens up.  Dussander
     pockets the note.  EDWARD FRENCH, 40's, stands in the doorway.
     He wears a turtle neck under his sportcoat.  

 FRENCH              Mr. Bowden?

 DUSSANDER              Mr. French, a pleasure.  

     There is a bit of hesitation on French's part, but they shake 
     hands.  Dussander notices the shoes on French's feet, bright red
     converse high-tops.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              My, those are some... colorful shoes.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRENCH'S OFFICE - DAY 
     French makes his way around his desk.  Dussander stands by the
     door.

 FRENCH              To you, sir, I'm sure they seem quite out of 
             the ordinary.  But when it is your job to get 
             confused sixteen year-olds to open up to you,
             you take whatever steps you need.  Please
             have a seat.  

     They both sit.  

 DUSSANDER              And the shoes work? 

 FRENCH              They seem to help, believe it or not.  Well,
             I thank you for coming down, Mr.  Bowden, but
             I'll be frank with you...  

 DUSSANDER              Yes, please do.

 FRENCH              The fact that you're here and not Todd's
             parents tells me a great deal.  

 DUSSANDER              I'm sure.  My son and his wife asked me to 
             come in and discuss this sorry business with 
             you, Mr.  French.  Todd is a good boy, believe
             me.  This trouble with his grades is only
             temporary.  

     Dussander pulls out his cigarettes and then, thinking twice,
     puts them back.

 FRENCH              It's all right.
                    (pulls an ashtray from desk
                    drawer) 
             There's no smoking on school grounds, but if 
             it will make you more comfortable, I'll never
             tell.

 DUSSANDER              A terrible habit, but thank you.
                    (lights up) 
             I suppose I should begin by informing you 
             that my son and my daughter-in-law are having
             troubles at home.  Rather bad troubles, I
             should think.  

 FRENCH              I appreciate your candor.  

 DUSSANDER                     (leaning in)
             The mother drinks.

 FRENCH              Oh.  

 DUSSANDER              Yes.  The boy has told me that he has come
             home on two occasions and has found her 
             sprawled out on the kitchen table.  He knows 
             how my son feels about her drinking and so on
             these occasions he has put dinner in the oven
             himself and forced enough black coffee down 
             his mother's throat so that she will at least
             be awake when Richard gets home.

 FRENCH              That's bad.  Has Mrs. Bowden thought about
             getting professional help for her problem? 

 DUSSANDER              The boy has tried to persuade her, but she is
             far too ashamed, I think.  If she was given a
             little time...  You understand? 

 FRENCH              Of course.  Your son... Todd's father...

 DUSSANDER              He is not without blame, believe me.  The
             hours he works.  The meals he has missed.  
             They take a toll on a family.  I was raised
             to believe that a man's family came before 
             his work or anything else.  I tried to teach
             my son that... but --

 FRENCH              There's only so much we can teach our kids, 
             Mr. Bowden.  ...What about Monica's mother or
             father?  Couldn't they talk to her? 

 DUSSANDER              Her mother, Sabrina, lives in a nursing home
             in Florida.  I'm afraid after her husband
             died she lost her will to live.  

 FRENCH              Probably not the best person for Monica to
             speak to.  

 DUSSANDER              Indeed.  

 FRENCH              Mr. Bowden, I don't have to remind you, I'm 
             sure, of Todd's stellar academic record.
             National Merit Scholar finalist, Academic
             All-Stars.  

 DUSSANDER              Yes.  I keep his certificates on the wall of
             my store.  I run a small bookstore in San
             Remo.  

     A hint of skepticism crosses French's eyes.  

 FRENCH                     (glancing at folder on desk) 
             Yes, I see that.  Anyway, Todd is, and I hate
             to phrase it this way, but he's one of the 
             ones worth fighting for.  He's a special kid,
             we both know that.  But If Todd's grades
             don't improve drastically and quickly...
             he'll be opening a real nasty can of worms.
             Summer school would just be the beginning.  
             His whole college acceptance schedule would
             be thrown way off course.  The good schools
             won't know what to make of him.  I'm sure
             he'd hate that and so would you.

 DUSSANDER              Of course.  

 FRENCH              So let's get to the bottom line, shall we? 
             What I'm proposing is some family counselling
             at the Counselling Center downtown.
             Everything is in confidence, of course.  A
             man in charge down there, Harry Shumacher, is 
             a good friend of mine.  I think Todd and his 
             parents should go see him together.  It might
             be difficult for Todd to go to his parents 
             with this; I think you should do it.  Maybe
             we can get everybody on track by the end of 
             the next quarter.  It will be tough, but not
             impossible.  

 DUSSANDER              I'm not sure that would be the best thing for
             the boy.  The parents might resent him if I
             took them that proposal right now.  Things
             are very delicate.  To swing the scale too 
             far in the wrong direction might cause more 
             harm than good.  The boy has promised to work
             harder in his studies.  He is most concerned
             by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than
             you might expect.  He has his mind set on 
             attending Stanford or Berkeley next fall and
             does not wish to see his plans altered.  

 FRENCH              Yes, well -- 

 DUSSANDER              Also, the parents would resent me.  Monica
             already thinks I meddle too much in her
             affairs.  

 FRENCH              I have a great deal of experience in these 
             matters, Mr. Bowden.  And please understand
             that my interest in your son's marital 
             problems begins and ends with the effect they
             are having on Todd.  And right now I think 
             they are having quite an effect.  I really
             think counselling is in order here.  

 DUSSANDER              Allow me to make a counter proposal.  You 
             have, I believe, a system for warning parents
             of poor grades? 

 FRENCH              Yes, Interpretation of Progress cards.  IOP
             cards.  The kids call them flunk card.  They
             only get them when their grades in a class 
             fall below the seventy percent.  That means a
             "D" or an "F".  Why? 

 DUSSANDER              And they are sent out when? 

 FRENCH              Mid-quarter.  That's about three weeks into
             the new marking period.  

 DUSSANDER              Allowing for Christmas break, the next time
             they are sent out will be in late January,
             correct?

 FRENCH              Yes, that's right.  

 DUSSANDER              Good.  Then what I suggest is this...  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY 
     Dussander still wears the blue suit.  The tie has been loosened
     and top button undone.  Todd still wears his backpack.

 TODD              You what? 

 DUSSANDER              I told him you were getting back on track by
             your own accord.  I gave him my word.  If you
             get even one flunk card--

 TODD              Are you out of your fucking mind?  I'm going
             to get three or four flunk cards.  I failed
             an economics test today, so there's another
             one. 

 DUSSANDER              Boy, it was the best I could do without
             arousing suspicion.  

 TODD              I could have done better myself --

 DUSSANDER              Well you didn't, did you?  This is the way it
             is and now you are upset because the only way
             you can make things right is to work.

 TODD              You're insane.  I'm upset because it can't be done.  

 DUSSANDER              It can.  And it will.  You will work.  

 TODD              I don't take orders from you.  Maybe you've
             forgotten --

 DUSSANDER                     (turning on him) 
             Listen, boy.  Before today it was possible,
             just barely possible, that you could have
             denounced me and come out clean yourself.  
             The way your nerves have been lately I don't
             think so, but never mind that.  It was - at
             least technically possible.  But now things
             have changed.  Today I impersonated your 
             grandfather, one Victor Bowden.  And it was
             you who arranged the meeting.  What would
             people make of that?  If things come out 
             now... perhaps you were right, your age and a
             good attorney might keep you out of jail, but
             you would be humiliated, boy, publicly.  You 
             would be infamous.  Your parents too.  Do you 
             know what such a scandal would do to them?
             To you?  Think about that.  

     Todd is stunned.  He turns away, then back again, struggling for
     the right words.  

 TODD              You fucker.  

 DUSSANDER              It's a done deal, boy.  If you don't like it,
             you can discuss it at family counselling.  

 TODD              God!  I wish... I wish -- 

 DUSSANDER              Never mind your wishes.  Your wishes make me
             sick.  All I want to hear is that you
             understand the situation.  

     Todd is furious.  He sees there is no other way, but continues
     fighting.

 TODD              Look, you gotta believe me.  There is no way
             in hell that I can pull myself out of a half
             year slide in a couple of weeks.  I wish I 
             could, but we're just going to have to think
             of something else.  

 DUSSANDER              Boy, the time for discussion is over.  This
             is the way it is.  You are going to work.
             And I am going to be right here with you.  

 TODD              What are you talking about? 


 EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY 
     Todd is standing with his bike on a dirt path.  He is looking
     out at something.  The wind blows throw his hair.  A distant
     glimpse of some buildings off to the side tell us he is on a
     hill.  

 DUSSANDER (V.O.)              You are going to spend the rest of this 
             quarter, all of your vacation and the first 
             three weeks of January studying.  During your
             free period you will study.  During lunch,
             you will study.  And after school and on 
             weekends you will come here and do the same.


 EXT. BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DAY 
     Todd pedals his bike furiously toward the camera.  He approaches
     a tunnel lined with corrugated metal below an overpass.

 TODD (V.O.)              Not here, at home.  

 DUSSANDER (V.O.)              No.  At home you will dawdle, you will talk
             on the telephone, watch TV.  Here, I can make
             sure that nothing distracts you from your
             studies.

     Todd emerges from the tunnel.  


     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #3: EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT

     Spotlights, like those from a guard tower, criss cross over a 
     small compound surrounded by an electrified fence.  Inside the 
     pen, wolf-like dogs snarl and gnash their teeth.  The spotlight
     catches the source of their aggravation...  

     Dussander, caught ghoulishly in the roving light, stands in 
     uniform outside the pen.  He is laughing.  In his hand is his
     Luger.  He fires through the fence, killing one of the dogs.
     They go wild.  He laughs harder.  He shoots again, and then
     again.  It is like shooting fish in a barrel.  

     The light beam passes the pen to reveal that the dogs have 
     transformed into human prisoners.  They maneuver helplessly to
     avoid Dussander's bullets.  But he fires faster, his laugh 
     growing more extreme.  His movements in between shots becomes a 
     sort of dance.  One prisoner flies against the fence in a pools
     of sparks.  As Dussander's waltz reaches it's climax, one 
     prisoner remains in the pen.  He looks up.  It is Todd.  Angle
     on Dussander's toothy grin.  The gun comes up...  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
     Dussander wakes up.  A CLANKING SOUND echoes from the street.
     Dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex 
     dream, but he turns his head toward the direction of the street.
     He clicks on the light.  Dressed in the SS uniform, he gets up
     and moves toward the window.  

     Through the window, bathed in the glow of a street lamp, a
     derelict, who we will come to know as ARCHIE, rummages through
     Dussander's trashcans.  Under his arm are a few of the empty 
     bourbon bottles.  


 INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - NIGHT 
     The car pulls into the driveway of Todd's house.  Becky is
     smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window.  They both
     look a little tipsy, as if they have been to a party.  She holds 
     the joint up to Todd.  He contemplates, then takes it.  Todd's
     first toke of marijuana isn't very small.  Becky looks on, 
     surprised.  She reaches out for the joint and Todd waves her 
     off.  He pulls again, this time ingesting a huge hit.  He holds 
     it, then exhales.  He gives the roach back to Becky.

 TODD              Their light is still on.  I'll get out on
             your side.  Don't say anything.

     Becky gets out.  Todd slides over and does the same.  She 
     crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her
     purse.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Dussander watches Archie collect the cans and bottles.  There is
     something about Archie that makes Dussander wonder if he has
     seen him before.  Archie looks up, right into Dussander's 
     window, as if he were expecting him to be there.  The two stare
     at one another for a long moment.  Suddenly Dussander is aware
     that he is dressed in the SS uniform.  

     He quickly steps back from the window.  His breathing is short 
     and erratic as he waits in the shadows for Archie to finish.  
     After a long moment, the noise from the street stops.  We hear
     only the faint steps of Archie walking away.  


 INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT 
     Todd and Becky's lips are locked in a passionate kiss. In their
     exuberance they fall onto the bed.  As they try to undress and
     kiss at the same time, Becky begins to moan.  Todd brings his
     fingers to his lips.  

 TODD              Shhh.  

     Their clothes tumble off around them.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Don't move.  

     He slides off her and opens the drawer by his bed.  He pulls out
     a condom.  By now she is naked.  Todd slips out of his underwear
     and falls on top of her.  The RADIO plays in the b.g. as Todd
     begins to grind away with his hips.  She moans softly with 
     delight.

     The CAMERA MOVES off of them to reveal a man in a lab coat 
     setting up a volt meter.  This is one of the scientists from 
     Todd's laboratory nightmare.  The CAMERA continues TO PAN across
     the bedroom, showing the other scientists preparing for the 
     electricity experiment.  The CAMERA STOPS on Dussander,
     clipboard in hand, observing everything carefully.  

     Todd releases with a final thrust.  Becky is MOANING in a series
     of high, fast yelps.  Todd lies still on her body.  Becky is
     speechless, still quivering from the unusually intense love
     making.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     The bedroom is dark except for the glowing tip of a cigarette.
     Dussander is in bed, wide awake...  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
 TITLE: JANUARY 1985 
     Todd sits alone at the table, eating while he studies.  
     Dussander crosses the frame behind him, drink in hand.  Todd is
     noticeably annoyed by Dussander's presence.


 EXT. BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DUSK 
     It is raining.  Todd is riding fast.  He wears a raincoat with 
     the hood up.  He talks to himself loudly, but we can't make out
     what he is saying.  He enters the tunnel.  

     The muddy run-off inside the tunnel catches Todd by surprise.
     He loses control of the bike and falls into the mud.  

 TODD              Fuck.  

     Todd gets up and tries to free his bike, but the mud and water
     do not make the job easy.  He is almost finished when a gruff
     voice catches his attention.  

 ARCHIE (O.S.)              Hey, kid, you having some trouble? 

     Todd looks up and sees a figure moving toward him in the shadows
     of the tunnel. Todd quickly pulls out a pocket knife.  He flicks
     open the blade and hides it behind his leg.  

 TODD              No.  I got it... thanks.  

     The figure steps closer.  The light catches his face to reveal
     Archie.  He is an unshaven, filthy mess, and when he speaks his
     words are slurred from years of steady drinking.  

 ARCHIE              That case maybe you could loan me a dollar.
             Help out a Vietnam vet? How 'bout it? 

     Todd eyes the man cautiously.  He looks around.  No one is 
     nearby.  The constant din of the rain echoes within the confines
     of the tunnel.  

 TODD              I... I don't know... I don't think so.  

     Todd palms the knife out of sight and slowly approaches the bum.  

 ARCHIE              C'mon, you got something for me.  I know you
             do.

 TODD              Well, maybe... I have to check.  

     Todd's hands go into his pockets.  He stops a few feet from the
     bum.  

 ARCHIE              See, I got to get up to L.A.  Got a job
             waiting for me up there.  

     Todd moves closer.  Close enough to touch the bum.  

 TODD              I thought I did have a couple of quarters...

     The bum looks at him hopefully. Todd looks back at him, sizing
     him up, really noticing him for the first time.  

 ARCHIE              You know, 
                    (his voice drops) 
             For a dollar I'll give you a blow job.  Take 
             you right up there where it's still dry.  You
             never had so good, kid.  You'll come your
             brains out.  

     Todd freezes for a moment.  The bum is right in his face.  
     Suddenly Todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints
     back to his bike.  He hops on and is gone in a flash, leaving
     the bum there to pick up the scattered coins.  

     As Todd zips away, the hood is off his head.  The rain begins to
     beat away the splattered mud from his face.


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY 
     Mr. Proxmire makes his way through the rows of desks.  He is
     passing out papers.  

 PROXMIRE              Our illustrious administration, in its quest
             to make my job as difficult as possible, has
             decided that home room teachers are now 
             responsible for handing IOP cards for all 
             your classes.  So for those of you getting
             flunk cards, you'll find them attached to
             last week's exam.  

     Moans erupt from the class.  Todd sits motionless at his desk.
     The moment of truth.  Proxmire passes him and places the exam
     face down on Todd's desk.  Todd hesitates before turning it
     over.  He is sweating.  

     He flips the paper over and glares at the small card clipped to
     the top of the paper.  He picks up the card and reads it: "I'm
     sure glad I didn't have to give you one of these for real!
     Great improvement, Todd. -- Anne Leland."  Todd cannot contain 
     his delight.  Nearby students stare curiously at the strange boy
     beaming over his flunk card.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     Dussander sits at the table.  He holds the IOP card out at arm's
     length to read it.  The bourbon bottle next to him is empty.
     Todd sits across from him.  

 DUSSANDER              Well, this calls for a celebration, no? 

     Dussander gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  

 TODD              Look, I guess I owe a lot of this to you.
             I'm not proud of it, but it's true.  

 DUSSANDER                     (eyeing him cautiously)
             Your gratitude humbles me.
                    (pause) 
             How about some Ritz crackers and Velveeta?

 TODD              Sure, what the hell.  

     Dussander goes about his task, taking items from the cabinets, 
     etc.  Todd watches all of this intently, but without expression.  

 DUSSANDER              I would have expected you to be doing back 
             flips down the hallway after such good news.
             You are so quiet.  

     Todd does not respond.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Today, I think, I give you the day off from
             studying.  How's that?  How about one of my
             stories instead?  I still have a few good
             ones saved up.  

 TODD              I don't care.  Whatever you want.  

     Todd is wringing his hand together nervously under the table.
     Dussander places a box of crackers on the table and goes back to
     the counter.

 DUSSANDER              Let's see.  I could tell you about the 
             special soap we made.  Or there is always the
             story of how I escaped from Berlin after I
             was foolish enough to go back.  That was a
             close one, I promise you.  

 TODD              Anything, really.  

 DUSSANDER              No, none of these I think.  You don't seem to
             be in the mood.  

     Dussander slices open a pack of Velveeta and puts it on a plate.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              I think today I will tell you the story of an
             old man who was afraid.  He was afraid of a
             certain young boy who was, in a queer way, 
             his friend.  The boy proved to be a very good
             student, but perhaps not in the way his 
             mother or his teachers had envisioned.  At 
             first the old man disliked the boy intensely,
             but then he grew to... to enjoy the boy's 
             company.  Of course, there was still a great
             deal of distrust between them.

     He puts a glass of Coke in front of Todd and goes back to the
     counter.  He opens a drawer, takes something out, closes it.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Each knew something that other wanted to keep
             secret.  But over time, the old man began to
             feel that things were changing.  He felt his
             hold on the boy slipping away from him.  

     Dussander goes to the cellar door.  His back is to Todd.  He
     opens the door and clicks on the light.  Todd stands up
     silently.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              So.  One sleepless night the old man got out
             of bed and wrote down the story of his 
             involvement with the boy.  Everything he 
             could remember, from the first day forward.  

     Todd has moved across the floor, careful not to let the floor 
     creak under his steps.  He is right upon Dussander.  Dussander
     reaches out with one arm for a fresh bottle, grasping onto the
     railing with the other.  His body hangs over the steep
     staircase.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              When he finished his hand was stinging from 
             arthritis but he felt good for the first time
             in weeks.  He felt safe.

     He gets his balance again and turns to face Todd.  Dussander
     holds the kitchen knife he was using earlier down at his side 
     where Todd can see it.  A tense silence passes between them.

     Todd is frozen.  Dussander steps past him and back into the 
     kitchen.  He closes the cellar door behind him. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              He climbed back into bed and slept until it
             was time for General Hospital.  

     Dussander sits back in his chair, cutting the seal on the fresh
     bottle. 

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              On the following day the old man put on his
             best suit and went down to one of the local
             banks and rented a safety deposit box.  The 
             bank officer explained to the old man that he
             would have a key and the bank would have a
             key.  To open the box both keys would be 
             needed.  No one but the old man could use the
             old man's key without a signed, notarized
             letter of permission from the old man 
             himself.  With one exception.

     Todd sinks into a chair across from Dussander and takes a sip of
     Coke.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              That exception is made in the event of the
             box-holder's death.  

 TODD              Then what? 

 DUSSANDER              Then the box is opened in the presence of a
             bank official and a representative of the 
             Internal Revenue Service.  The contents of 
             the box are inventoried.  In this case they 
             will find only a twelve-page document.  Non-
             taxable... but highly interesting.  

     Todd understands what the old man has told him.  He slams his
     glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair.  

 TODD              You can't... you can't do that.  

 DUSSANDER              My boy, it is already done.  

 TODD              But... Christ!  Look at you.  You could go at
             any time.  

     Todd stares at Dussander in disbelief.  After a moment he storms
     out the back door to the porch.  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY 
     Todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when
     Dussander steps onto the porch.  He carries with him the bottle
     of bourbon and a glass.  

 TODD              Then there is nothing for me.  

 DUSSANDER              But there is.  As the years go by, as I get
             closer to the grave, your hold on me will 
             become worth less and less.  A man five, ten
             years older than I worries more about his 
             ailing heart than being extradited to Israel.
             And there will come a day - if I live long
             enough - when I decide what you know no 
             longer matters.  Then, and only then, I will
             destroy my document.  

 TODD              But... but so many things can happen to you 
             in between.  Accidents.  Sickness.  You could
             slip in the shower, for Christ's sake...  

     Dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette.  He begins to
     sing softly, then gets caught up in the song...  Todd turns away, angry.

 DUSSANDER              Que sera, sera...  Whatever will be, will
             be... The future's not ours to see... Que
             sera, sera...  

     Pause.  Dussander sees he has pressed Todd's button.  He moves
     closer.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              My dear boy, I see you thinking about it, 
             even now.  It is in your eyes.  Killing me.
             It would take only a flick of a knife.  Or
             maybe push me down the steps, make it look 
             like an accident?  I am old.  You are strong.
             You are angry.  Good assets for killing.  But
             there is something missing...  

     Dussander speaks with a near whisper in Todd's ear.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              To have some one in your control.  To have
             them know that they are alive because you
             have not decided to the contrary.  Do you
             have that power?  Ask yourself.  It is no
             easy question.  I think you know that.  

     There is a long pregnant pause.  Then Todd lets out a sigh, as if
     to dismiss what he has just heard.  He turns to face Dussander.  

 TODD              You know this means we're through.  You won't
             be seeing me around here anymore.  

 DUSSANDER              No, I suppose I won't.  

 TODD              I'm never coming here again.  

 DUSSANDER              And so it comes to an end.  Here.

     Dussander pours a splash of bourbon into the boy's glass.  

 TODD              What are you doing? 

 DUSSANDER              A drink.  To our lives together, the
             beginning... and the end.  

     Todd picks up his glass.  

 TODD              I think you should fuck yourself.  

     He CLICKS his glass against Dussander's.

 DUSSANDER              My boy, don't you see that we are fucking
             each other? 

     He drinks.  Todd, reluctantly, does the same.

 FADE TO BLACK. 

 EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY 
 TITLE: APRIL 1985 
     Dussander, dressed smartly for a day out of the house, emerges
     from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the 
     sidewalk, the umbrella under his arm.  He stops at an empty bench 
     and sits to wait for the bus.  

     Archie sits down next to him.  At first Dussander doesn't pay
     attention to him, but Archie's behavior tells us that he is 
     keenly aware of Dussander's presence.  Dussander stares out into
     the street, but Archie fidgets about, his eyes roaming, and 
     finally slides a little closer to Dussander.  Dussander looks at
     him flatly.  Archie grins.  Dussander turns away, prepared to
     dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict.  Then
     Archie speaks...

 ARCHIE                     (leaning over) 
             I notice the kid don't come around no more.  

     Dussander doesn't respond.  He catches Archie in a glance and
     sees that he is staring at him.  

 DUSSANDER              What?

 ARCHIE              Little blond-hair boy. ...What's the matter,
             you ain't his friend no more? 

     Dussander is like stone, flashing the eyes of a man who is not
     to be harassed.  Finally...  

 DUSSANDER              You mistake me for somebody else. ...Pardon
             me, my bus is coming.  

     Dussander stands, slightly rattled only to those who know him
     well.  He looks down the street for the bus.  Archie doesn't 
     move.  Rather, he inspects Dussander from head to toe, stopping
     on the shoes.  

 ARCHIE              Damn... Cuban high heels.  Nice ones, too. 

     The SQUEAL of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in 
     front of Dussander.  He has become perceptibly more nervous as
     he waits for the passengers to exit.  He climbs up the first
     step.

 ARCHIE              I ain't seen a pair like that since I was in
             Havana.  
                    (talking louder because of the 
                    bus) 
             That's the only place you can get'em.  Can't
             get'em exported... Government don't let you.  

     The door closes behind Dussander. The bus pulls away. Through
     the window of the bus Dussander watches Archie as he continues
     his speech to no one.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 
 TITLE: MAY 1985 
     Todd sits nervously in a chair next to a tough, leather-clad 
     trouble maker.  A SECRETARY sits behind a long desk.  Her phone
     beeps and she picks it up.  

 SECRETARY              Go in, Todd.  They're waiting for you.  

     Todd approaches a door marked: "Dr. Carl N. Morgan - Principal."
     He goes in.  


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY 
     Todd opens the office door.  As his eyes scan the floor he
     notices a familiar pair of yellow high-tops.  He looks up to see
     Ed French leaning against the wall.  Seated at the desk is
     MORGAN, a thin, stern man, around 50.  Todd's face shows a
     moment of trepidation, but he regains his composure almost
     instantly.

 MORGAN              Have a seat, Todd.  

     Todd does as Morgan pours over Todd's files.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              I see from your record and from what Mr.  
             French tells me that after a minor slip up
             last semester you're right back on course.
             Straight A's for the quarter so far.  And I 
             hear your little slip didn't bother the folks
             up at Stanford too much either.  

 FRENCH              A good break for you, Todd.  

 MORGAN              Looks like that little talk with your...
                    (looks at file) 
             grandfather... really helped.  Well, we don't
             want to keep you too long.  
                    (to French)
             You tell him.  

 FRENCH              Well, it seems Sally Chong didn't do to well
             in A.P. biology.

 MORGAN              She failed it.  

 FRENCH              I'm afraid so.  She refused to take part in 
             the fetal pig dissection.  The teacher begged
             her to drop the class, but Sally thought she
             could pass anyway.  

 MORGAN              Stubborn girl... What we're telling you, son,
             is that because Sally Chang -

 FRENCH              Chong.  

 MORGAN              Because Sally Chong wouldn't hack up a baby 
             pig, you snuck by her in the rankings.  So if
             you can keep your grades up for two more
             months -- any reason that shouldn't happen? 

 TODD              No.  

 MORGAN              Then you'll make valedictorian, Todd.
             Congratulations.  

 FRENCH              Congratulations, Todd.  

     French shakes Todd's hand, an uneasy moment passes between the
     two of them.


 INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY 
     Todd comes out of Morgan's office.  French follows him.  

 FRENCH              Todd, you really should be proud of yourself.
             To tell you the truth, I'm amazed you pulled 
             it off.  

 TODD              Thanks, I guess.  

     He starts to walk away.  

 FRENCH              I was glad to hear you made varsity baseball.
             I spoke to the coach.  He says your coming
             along real well.  

 TODD              Thanks.  

 FRENCH              It's turning out to be a good year for you.  

 TODD              Yeah.  

     He turns to go, but French stops him again.  

 FRENCH              Todd, wait.  

     He steps up to Todd and lowers his voice, as if he were hedging
     a touchy subject.

 FRENCH (CONT'D)              Todd, you've got a lot of good things going
             on right now.  You should be enjoying
             yourself.  

 TODD              I am.  

     French's looks says, "No, you're not." 

 FRENCH              How are things at home? 

     Todd realizes he is not going to get out of this easily.  

 TODD              Look, things with my parents were bad for a
             while.  But they're doing a lot better.  
             Thanks for your concern, really.  I should
             get back to class.  

     He is pulling away from French as he speaks.  

 FRENCH                     (unconvinced) 
             Okay, Todd.  I know this isn't the place to
             talk about this.  But my door is always open...

 TODD              I know.  Thanks.  

     Todd walks away.  

 FRENCH              And it's going to stay open.  

     But Todd does not turn around.  French stares after him.  The
     BELL RINGS, and Todd is swallowed by the stream of students
     emerging from the class rooms.  


 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
     Todd is kneeling down at the bike rack.  His backpack is on the
     ground next to him.  He unlocks his bike and begins to coil the
     chain around his wrist when Joey walks by.  He sees Todd and
     considers going by, but stops.  We can tell they haven't spoken
     in a while.  

 JOEY              Hey there.  

     Todd looks up.  He seems pleasant, but there is little warmth in
     his voice.  

 TODD              Hey.  

     Pause.  They look at each other.  Joey wants to talk.  Todd
     slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack.  Joey
     jingles his car keys anxiously.  

 JOEY              I... ah, I heard about Stanford.  I heard a
             couple of weeks ago actually. ...Congrats.  

 TODD              Thanks.  

 JOEY              I got into school to.  Long Beach.  It's no
             Stanford, but...  

     Joey shrugs.  It's an awkward moment.  He walks closer.  

 TODD              No, no... that's good, Joe.  

 JOEY              Well, ...I just wanted to say hi.  Here let
             me get that.  

     Joey reaches for Todd's backpack.  He lifts it.  The heaviness
     puzzles him.  Todd takes it from him.  

 JOEY (CONT'D)              What do you have in there? 

     Todd stares at him stone-faced.  Joey doesn't like Todd's
     expression.  Todd takes the bag from him and puts it on.  

 TODD              You busy now? 

 JOEY              Uhh...  

 TODD              Come with me.  Hop on.  

 JOEY              Hop on?  I have a car now, Todd.  

 TODD              You can't drive where we're going.  


 EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY 
     Joey sits on the handle bars as Todd pedals over the rugged
     terrain.  Joy looks scared, but appears to be enjoying the ride 
     and the chance to be with his old friend.  

     The next shot shows Todd's bike laying on the ground.  The
     wheels still turn slowly.  The camera moves to reveal Todd and
     Joey standing on a rocky ledge.  Orange Country sprawls out
     before them.  

     Under the cross-hairs of a telescopic sight, a truck, from the
     freeway below, zooms out of frame.  The image vanishes.  We see
     Joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand.  

 JOEY              This is so cool.  

 TODD              Point it over here.  That's the middle 
             school.  You can see right into our old class
             room.  

 JOEY              Oh yeah... But I still don't see what you 
             need the rest of it for.  Doesn't your Dad
             notice? 

     The hunting rifle, disassembled, sticks out of Todd's backpack
     on the ground.  

 TODD              He hasn't yet.  

 JOEY              Yet?... Jesus, Todd.  

     He is trying to joke, but the seriousness is clearly in his
     voice.  

 TODD              And over here, that's your dad's office.  And
             there's the old drive-in.  

     Joey isn't looking through the scope anymore.  He holds it out
     to Todd, watching him.  

 JOEY              Here.  Take it.  

     Todd grabs the scope.  But Joey doesn't let go.  He finally
     locks Todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months.  He
     wants to say something.  Todd takes the scope.  He sees that 
     Joey is serious.  He takes a few steps toward the edge, toward
     the gun.  He looks out.  

 TODD              It's such a rush, you know?... To be up here.
             Don't you feel it?  So high above them they
             never know we're here.  It's like an ant 
             farm.  We're the gods on Mt. Olympus, Joey.
             They can't see us, they can't hear us, but
             every so often we can make them feel us.
             Just so they never forget.  Look...  

     He looks through the scope at the freeway.  He picks out passing
     cars.

 TODD (CONT'D)              There goes a future track star.  There goes a
             judge.  A mom and her two kids.  A policeman.
             That one's a school teacher, that one's a
             drug dealer... You see, Joey, it doesn't 
             matter.  It doesn't matter how smart you are
             ...or how many grades you skip.  There's 
             always someone who can take it all away.  The
             right person snaps their fingers... and it's
             done.  

     Joey takes a few steps backward.  Todd doesn't notice.

 JOEY              Todd, I'm gonna go.  I'm gonna... walk home.  

     Todd turns his head toward Joey, but it is as though no one is 
     there.  He looks away again.

 JOEY (CONT'D)              Todd...

     Pause.  Todd looks again.  But this time Joey is really gone.  A
     slight chuckle escapes Todd's mouth.  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S STREET - EVENING 
 TITLE: JUNE 1985 
     Dussander plods down the sidewalk with his sacks of groceries.  
     He is a little more winded, moves a little slower than
     previously.

     Suddenly Archie emerges from behind a group of trees.  He moves
     quickly up to Dussander, catching him off guard.  

 ARCHIE              I can do that.  I can help you carry those.  

     Dussander jumps back.  Archie stops.  

 ARCHIE (CONT'D)              You don't gotta be afraid.  I can carry those.

     Dussander does not move.  But slowly his face changes and we
     realize that he remembers Archie from the bus stop.  

 DUSSANDER              I don't need any help. ...Excuse me.  

     He starts off again.  Archie follows.  

 ARCHIE              Hey, I ain't a bad guy.  You don't gotta
             worry.  I'm a veteran.  I just want--

 DUSSANDER                     (snapping at him) 
             What?  What do you want?  Why do you bother me? 

     Archie is taken aback by the sudden viciousness.  

 ARCHIE                     (plaintively)
             You got a nice face.  

 DUSSANDER              No I don't.  

 ARCHIE              Look, we're practically neighbors.  I stay
             right over there most nights.  
                    (pointing across the street) 
             I see you walking down the street.  I come up
             to help.  It's called being neighborly.

     They are nearing Dussander's yard.  

 DUSSANDER              Piss off.  

     Fed up with his belligerence, Archie strips the bags from
     Dussander's hands with ease.  Dussander knows he is outmatched.  

 ARCHIE              Ain't no reason to be rude.  You see, I know
             something about you. ...I know your a nice
             guy.  I'm nice too, ...just like the kid.  

     Dussander looks up and down the street.  No one is around.

 DUSSANDER              I see.  

 ARCHIE              And I know you got some bourbon in these 
             bags.  I ain't ashamed to say I could use a 
             drink about now.  But I don't need no charity.
             If you want to invite me in, like a friend,
             we could have a nice drink.  

 DUSSANDER              A drink.  

 ARCHIE              That's what I'm saying.  

     Long pause.  

 DUSSANDER              You smell like a toilet.  

 ARCHIE              Maybe you let me use your shower.  But first 
             a drink.  After that I'll do anything you say.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
     Dussander and Archie come through the front door.  Archie scans
     the room.

 ARCHIE              Yeah, this is nice.  Real nice.  

 DUSSANDER              Let me take those.  
                    (takes the bags)
             Right this way.  

     Dussander moves toward the kitchen.  Archie watches him walk
     away.  A smile crosses his face as he follows him to the kitchen.


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - EVENING 
     Todd and his parents are together in the living room.  Todd is
     studying for his trigonometry final.  Monica sits at the couch
     addressing graduation announcements.  Dick is at his desk,
     pouring over a pile of receipts.  

 MONICA              I guess your parents don't need a graduation 
             announcement.

 DICK              No.  

 TODD              Grandma and Grandpa aren't coming?

 MONICA                     (to Dick) 
             I thought you told him.  

 DICK              Christ, I forgot.  Todd, my aunt Patty, Dad's
             sister, died on Wednesday.  Mom and Dad have
             to drive up to Fresno to settle her estate.  
             We can't ask Dad to drive six hours each way
             for graduation.  

 MONICA              If we ask them, they'll do it.  

 DICK              That's why.  You understand, don't you, Todd? 

     Todd thinks for a moment, realizes something.  

 TODD              Of course, Dad.  It's all right.  Tell
             Grandpa I'll spend the week with him and
             Grandma when they get back.

 MONICA              What about Mr. Denker?  I almost forgot about
             him.  

 TODD              No, He won't want to come.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN & BASEMENT - EVENING 
     Archie, seated at the table with his back to Dussander, is in
     the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which
     Dussander half-listens.  Dussander goes to the cabinets and 
     takes out two glasses.  He pours the drinks and sets the glasses
     on the table.  Archie picks his up and is about to drink.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Ah-ah.  

     Dussander picks up his glass to toast Archie.  Archie CLINKS his
     glass to Dussander's and downs the shot.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              I believe we need another bottle, my friend.  

 ARCHIE              Well if you're offering, I'm accepting.  

     Dussander goes to the cellar door to retrieve another bottle.  

 DUSSANDER              No trouble at all.  Now where is my bottle
             opener?  Ah, here it is.  

     Dussander pulls something out of a drawer.  He goes to the table
     and stands right behind Archie.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Why don't you drink mine? 

     Archie picks up the glass and begins to drink, slower this time.
     Dussander pulls Archie's tattered hat off his head and sets it
     on the table.  He then begins to stroke the matted knots of
     Archie's hair.

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              You don't mind do you? 

 ARCHIE              No. I don't mind. ...Maybe in the morning - 
             everything goes okay - you could let me have
             ten dollars.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps.  

 ARCHIE              Maybe even twenty.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps.  We shall see.  

     Pause.  

 ARCHIE              You can relax, you know, I've done this before.  

 DUSSANDER              It's all right.  So have I.  

     Dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of Archie's neck.  
     He starts to plunge it in just as Archie turns back to look at
     him.  The fork goes in crooked.  Archie explodes from the chair,
     HOWLING, his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear.  With
     the fork protruding from his back, Archie tosses the table to 
     the side.  The empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor
     and shatters.  Archie spins and slams a fist into Dussander's 
     temple.  Dussander collapses against the counter.  Archie moves
     about wildly, trying to grab the fork and pummel Dussander at
     the same time.  Blood is streaming freely from his wound.  

     Dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the
     counter.  As Archie approaches, Dussander swings the pan into
     Archie's descending fist.  Archie winces and staggers backward.
     He stomps down on the broken bottle and screams.  His guard
     falls briefly.  Dussander is upon him.  He swings the pan,
     catching Archie squarely in the face.  

     Archie brings his hands up to his face, which now oozes with
     blood.  Blinded by the blow, Archie charges Dussander, who 
     crouches to the side, and as Archie passes, hurls himself into
     the man's back, sending him through the open door of the cellar.
     Archie flies down the stairs face-first, tumbling into the 
     packed dirt floor like a derailed train.  Dussander, exhausted 
     and bloodied, exhales deeply.  Looking down at the crumpled body
     below, he straightens his tie, brushes the hair from his face,
     and then surveys the kitchen.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              What a mess.  

     He rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the 
     steps to finish the bum for good.  After about three steps he
     stops abruptly.  He appears puzzled, but after a moment the
     expression changes.  A look of searing pain rushes across his 
     face.  Dussander brings his hand to his chest.  He collapses on
     the stairs.  He is having a heart attack and knows it.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Oh my God.  

     He looks down at Archie, up to the kitchen, then back down to
     the cellar.  A moment of decision.  

     The stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they
     did a minute ago.  Getting to his feet, he turns slowly toward
     the kitchen.  He starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace,
     counting with each step.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Ein... Zwei... Drei...  


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER 
     The same scene as before.

 DICK              Monica... how long did we rent those jet skis
             in Hawaii? 

 MONICA              About two hours.  Why? 

 DICK              This receipt says we had two jet skis for
             twenty-three hours a piece.  The bill is 
             fifteen hundred dollars.  Didn't you look at
             the receipt before you signed it? 

     Todd doesn't look up from his textbook.  

 TODD              Way to go, Mom.  

 MONICA              That bill was written in Japanese.  I told
             you that.  

 DICK              Numbers are numbers, Monica, in any language.

 MONICA              That guy didn't speak a word of English.  I
             told you not to rent from him.  

     The PHONE RINGS.  Monica gets up to get it.  

 MONICA (CONT'D)              I'll get it.  

 DICK              That's not the point.  You should always read
             the bill before you sign.  I've told you that
             a hundred times.
                    (to Todd) 
             Fifteen hundred dollars.  

 TODD              Maybe it's in yen.  

     Pause.  Dick looks at the bill.  

 DICK              Hey, maybe you're right.  

     Monica comes back into the room.  

 MONICA              Todd, it's Mr.  Denker.  He sounds excited 
             about something.  You better speak to him.  

     Todd rises from the couch.  His mood shifts instantly.

 TODD                     (into phone) 
             Mr. Denker? 

     INTERCUT: between Todd in his living room and...  



 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander leaning against a wall in his blood-stained kitchen.
     The wall above Dussander read 6:50.  

 DUSSANDER              Come over right away, boy.  I'm having a
             heart attack, a bad one, I think.  

 TODD              Gee, that sounds exciting, Mr. Denker, but I
             was studying for my trig final -- 

 DUSSANDER              I understand that you cannot talk, but you
             can listen.  I cannot call 911...  at least 
             not yet.  There is quite a mess here.  I need
             help... and that means you need help.  

 TODD              Well if you put it that way -- 

 DUSSANDER              Tell your parents I've had a letter, an 
             important letter, and I need you to read it
             to me.

 TODD              Yeah, sure.  I'll be right there.  

 DUSSANDER              Now we see what you are made of, boy.  

     Dussander hangs up the phone and falls into a chair.  


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT 
 TODD              Bye.  
                    (hangs up) 
             I've got to run over to Mr. Denker's for a 
             minute.

 MONICA              Is everything all right? 

 TODD              Oh, he just got a letter from a nephew in 
             Hamburg or Dusseldorf or one of those places.  

 DICK              I thought his family was killed in the war.  

     Todd zips up his jacket.  

 TODD              So did he.  That's why he sounded excited.  I
             shouldn't be too long.  I'll take your car,
             Mom? 

 MONICA              I don't know, you have a final tomorrow.  

 TODD              I know, I was almost finished studying anyway.  

 DICK              Don't be gone too long, Todd.  

 TODD              See you in a bit.  

     He kisses Monica on the cheek.  He is out the front door.


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT 
     Todd's driving reflects his state of mind: erratic and out of
     control.  He meets a police car at an intersection and almost 
     runs a red light.  The police car doesn't bother him, however,
     and a moment later he pulls the Honda up to Dussander's house.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd appears in the door of the kitchen.  His face tells us that
     what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected.  The
     room is a gruesome sight.  Blood and broken glass are 
     everywhere.  The table has been knocked to the side.  Dussander,
     barely conscious, slumps in a chair.  

 TODD              What the fuck...? 

     Todd moves to the center of the room, careful not to step in any
     blood.  He doesn't know what to do.  His attention falls on
     Dussander.  Suddenly he rushes to him and begins to inspect his
     body carefully.

 TODD (CONT'D)              Where are you bleeding?... wake up.

     Dussander does not respond.  Todd shakes him harder.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Wake up, goddamnit! 

     Dussander stirs a little, aggravated.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              I thought you said you had a fucking heart attack.  

 DUSSANDER              It's not my blood, for Christ's sake.  

     Pause.  

 TODD              What did you say? 

 DUSSANDER              It was self-defense, boy.  Go downstairs.
             You'll see what needs to be done.  

     Dussander points to the open cellar door.  

 TODD              Fuck you.  I'm not going down there.  What
             happened?  What did you do? 

     Dussander only stares back at him, then looks away, almost 
     smiling through his incredible pain, as if to challenge Todd.

 TODD (CONT'D)              What the hell is this? 

     Dussander does not respond.  Todd stares at him for a moment,
     then moves toward the cellar.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Todd is half-way down the stairs when he freezes.  Sprawled out
     on the ground below him is Archie, motionless.  The meat fork
     still protrudes from his neck like an antenna.  

 TODD              Jesus Fucking Christ.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Suddenly Dussander is more awake than we realize.  When he hears
     Todd discover the body, he slides his chair over to the cellar 
     door and slams it shut.  His face is red with pain as he pushes
     the dead bolt into place, locking Todd in the cellar.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT & KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd races up to the door.  He tries the handle and then pounds 
     on the door with his fist.  The following conversation cuts back
     between Todd and Dussander on opposite sides of the door.  

 TODD              Open the fucking door!  Right now.  Right
             now! 

     Dussander shoves his chair under the doorknob.  He drags the 
     table against the door as he speaks.  Todd is screaming on the
     other side and begins to kick at the door violently.  

 DUSSANDER              You give me no choice, boy.  

 TODD              What are you doing?  Open the door.

 DUSSANDER              If you won't help me, then I'll make you help
             me.  If you don't, we are finished.  

 TODD              Fuck you, old man.  This is your problem.  I
             didn't do this.  Open the door!  

     Todd pounds awayat the door.  Tears now stream down his cheeks.
     His relentless pounding has Dussander enraged.  Dussander pounds
     back at the door to shut Todd up.  It works.  

 DUSSANDER              Enough.  Enough.  Enough!  If you don't stop
             screaming like a fucking school girl I'm
             going to...  

     A surge of pain from his chest silences him.  He recovers,
     speaking slowly and deliberately.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              Now listen to me, boy, very carefully.  If
             you don't help me, I'm going to die here.  
             And if I die, there is no Stanford for you.  
             There is no scholarship.  There is jail.  My 
             document...  

 TODD              Fuck your document.  I got nothing to do with
             this.  Don't make it sound like I do.  I came
             here, I saw this shit, and now I'm getting 
             the fuck out of here.  That's what I'm gonna
             tell the police.  

 DUSSANDER              Why not tell them the truth?  Tell them I
             locked you in the cellar.  Tell them I 
             wouldn't let you out until you buried the
             body.  

 TODD              I'm not listening to this.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Todd runs down the stairs and leaps over Archie's body.  Under 
     the dim glow of a single naked bulb hanging from the ceiling, he
     searches for a way out.  He crosses the dirt floor toward a tiny
     window high on the opposite wall.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
 DUSSANDER              You must be at the window, yes?  As you can
             see I had it barred a few years ago.  A bad
             element started to move into the 
             neighborhood, you know how it is.  

 TODD (O.S.)              Fuck.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Todd realizes he can't get through the bars.  He turns around to
     find another option.  In the obscured background, Archie begins
     to stir.  Silent and bewildered, he feels the area around him 
     and rises slowly to his knees.  Todd doesn't see him and moves 
     into a dark corner of the cellar, rummaging through the piles of
     cluttered junk for something to help him escape.  He disappears
     for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a
     shovel, a fresh confidence on his face.  He holds it like a
     sledge hammer.  

 DUSSANDER (O.S.)              We are wasting time now, boy.  
                    (switches to a loud whisper) 
             Come back to the door.  You are not going to
             find anything down there to help you.  

 TODD                     (to himself)
             Oh really?  

     Todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from
     Archie when he sees him.  Todd, mortified, lets out a scream.
     This startles Archie, who cannot speak.  He only gurgles a
     SICKENING WHINE, the fork still sticks out of his neck.  Blood
     drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead.  Yet even on
     his knees, he is an imposing figure.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander, puzzled by the commotion, presses his ear against the
     door.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Archie blocks the stairs from Todd.  

 TODD              Get out of the way.

     But Archie is too disoriented to move.  Summoning all his
     courage, Todd pokes the shovel into him, as if to prod him out
     of the way.

     But when the blade of the shovel touches him, Archie counters
     violently, grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side.  
     Todd holds tightly to the handle, an act which sends him flying
     across the cellar.  The shovel stays with Archie, and now he 
     wields it like it were a child's toy.  He slashes it viciously
     through the air.  Todd hides under the stairs, watching Archie 
     duel with the shadows.  Todd bumps into something.  Archie hears
     him.  Through the slats in the staircase we see Archie jabbing
     the shovel at Todd.  

 TODD              Stop it!  Stop it!  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Alarmed, Dussander reaches for the lock, but hesitates, forever
     mindful of the chance of being duped.  His ear goes back against 
     the door.  

 DUSSANDER              What are you doing, boy?  It's not going to
             work, whatever it is.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     Archie pushes the shovel in too far and can't retrieve it.  Todd
     grabs the other end and pulls it through.  

 TODD              Fuck this.  

     Fed up, he comes around from under the stairs and confronts
     Archie.  Archie sees him and takes a step toward him.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              I mean it get the fuck away from me.  

     Archie steps closer.  Instantly, Todd tightens his grip on the
     shovel.  He is no longer afraid.  He swings the shovel at 
     Archie's head striking him.  Archie staggers back, stunned, but 
     then charges forward.  Todd strikes him again, this time with
     more force and anger.  Todd lifts the shovel to strike again,
     but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade.
     The glass shatters.  The room goes black.  

     A second later we HEAR a SHARP, authoritative BLOW, followed 
     quickly by another, then another.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Dussander knows something is wrong.  He slides the bolt back and
     slowly turns the handle.  He opens the door slightly and speaks
     into the darkness.  

 DUSSANDER              Hello?  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     A shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar
     floor, revealing Archie's slain body.  An expanding pool of
     blood seeps out from his head.  As the door upstairs opens 
     wider, the light falls on Todd standing over Archie, the shovel
     still in his hands, his face spattered with blood.

     The Todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed.  He
     stares up at Dussander, not with the eyes of a boy, but with 
     those of a man.  A man who can no longer be saved.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Quietly Dussander moves away from the door, leaving Todd alone
     with what he has done.  He slides the furniture away from the
     door, knowing, as Todd does, that the two of them are now
     working together.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - LATER 
     Todd's face is suddenly illuminated as he screws a fresh light 
     bulb into the dangling cord.  He picks up the shovel.  Archie's
     body still lies where it fell.  Todd goes to the open area of
     the floor and with a forceful stomp, plunges the shovel into the
     dirt.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER 
     Todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack
     the dirt, then smooths the area over to destroy any markings.
     He is sweaty, dirty, and tired.  But his manner is cool and
     efficient as he concentrates intently on the matters at hand.
     He runs upstairs, hopping over the bloody spot where Archie's
     body used to be.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd bursts through the door.  He notices the old man in his
     chair.  Dussander doesn't look good.  Todd levels his eyes at
     him.  His voice snaps with the authority of an S.S. commander.

 TODD              Where's the fucking pinesol?  

     Dussander points to the cabinet under the sink.  Todd throws the
     door open and pulls out bottles of cleaner.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Rags.  I need rags.  

 DUSSANDER              Cellar.  Under the stairs.  

     Todd checks the clock, it is 9:25.  He gets the bottle and a
     bucket and goes for the cellar.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 
     A SERIES OF SHOTS showing Todd cleaning up the mess.  He is on
     the stairs sponging up the blood.  Then we see him skimming the 
     area where the pool of blood was with the shovel.  The NEXT SHOT
     has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area.  Then, on his
     knees, he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light
     bulb and drops them into a bucket.  In the FINAL SHOT, Todd 
     stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar.  The shovel has
     been cleaned and replaced.  The floor looks smooth and even.
     Satisfied, he goes upstairs.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     The table has been put back in its spot.  Todd is in his boxer
     shorts.  A SHOT of a washing machine, somewhere else in the 
     house, shows us that Todd is cleaning his bloodied clothes.  Now
     he is washing the dishes in the sink.  The water in the sink is 
     a murky pink.  He pulls the meat fork from the suds and holds it up.  

 TODD              I ought to run this through your chest, you
             know that?

 DUSSANDER              It couldn't hurt more than a heart attack.  

     He looks at the clock - 10:15.

 TODD              Christ, my parents are going to freak.  

 DUSSANDER              Stay calm, boy.  You are doing fine.  

     Todd dries the murder weapon and puts it away.  For a moment he
     slows down, a hint of a smile suddenly comes over him.
     Dussander sees something is different about him.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              What are you thinking about?  

     The sound of Dussander's voice snaps Todd out of his funk.  He
     is all business again.

 TODD              Fuck off.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     Todd is back in his clothes.  He wears a white T-shirt.  He 
     brings a knife up to Dussander's neck and slices down his suit,
     still stained by Archie's blood.  

 TODD              Your pants are okay.  The shoes... no.

     Todd takes off Dussander's shoes and balls them up in the
     tattered suit.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Put this on.  

     He holds up Dussander's bathrobe.  The old man slips into it
     with difficulty as Todd dumps the bloodied clothing into a trash
     bag.  Dussander looks at Todd's T-shirt.  

 DUSSANDER              Is that my undershirt?  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     The blood and glass have been removed.  Todd runs a mop over the
     floor.  His job is almost over.  Sweat pours down his face.  The
     same for Dussander.  

 DUSSANDER              Hurry up, for God's sake.  

 TODD              Don't you die on me, you old bastard.  Not
             now.

     Todd puts the mop away.  He surveys the room as before.  
     Dussander does the same.  There is a strange silence as the two
     of them look around the room for anything damning.  

 DUSSANDER              I think we're okay.  

 TODD              Me too.  

 DUSSANDER              Call an ambulance. 

     Todd turns to face Dussander.  He brings his face up to his and
     speaks softly.

 TODD              The key.  

 DUSSANDER              What are you talking about?  

 TODD              The safety deposit box.  I want the key...  

 DUSSANDER              For God's sake, boy...  

 TODD              I want the key and I want to know where the
             bank is.

     Dussander cannot argue.

 DUSSANDER              Hillcrest Savings on Domingo Avenue.  The key
             is behind the clock on the mantle piece.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
     Todd goes straight for the mantle.  He moves the clock and finds
     the key.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
     Todd holds a blank piece of paper in front of Dussander and
     hands him a pen.  

 TODD              Sign this.  

 DUSSANDER              What for?  

 TODD              Sign it.  

     Dussander starts to scrawl his name across the paper.  

 TODD              No!  At the bottom... neatly.

     With great difficulty, Dussander does as he is told.  Todd folds
     the paper and stuffs it into his pocket with the pen.  He picks
     up the phone and dials.  

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)              911 emergency.  Do you need an ambulance?  

 TODD              Yes.  It's my friend, Mr. Du--

     Todd nearly bites his lip in half.  Dussander notices the slip
     and cringes.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Denker.  He had a heart attack.  

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)              Is he conscious?  

 TODD              Yeah, he's awake.  I'm really scared.  The
             address is 9 -- 

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)              We have the address here.  The ambulance is 
             on the way.  It should take about ten
             minutes.  I'll stay on the line with you -- 

 TODD              No.  I have to call my parents.  Just send
             the ambulance -- 

     He hangs up.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              It smells too clean in here.  

     Todd sees a pack of cigarettes on the table.  

 TODD (CONT'D)                     (offering)
             Cigarette?  

     Dussander is not amused.  Todd lights two cigarettes and lets 
     them burn down in the ashtray.  He picks up the phone again and
     dials.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Mommy, it's me.  Let me talk to Dad.  

 MONICA (V.O.)              What is it?  

 TODD              Just let me talk to him.  

 MONICA (V.O.)              Hold on -- 

 DICK (V.O.)              Todd, what's wrong.

 TODD              Mr. Denker had a heart attack.  

 DICK (V.O.)              Jesus.  Is he conscious?  

 TODD              Yeah, he's awake.  

 DICK (V.O.)              Thank God.  Todd, call an ambulance.  

 TODD              I did.  They're on the way.  

 DICK (V.O.)              All right, son.  Don't touch him.  I'll be
             there in five minutes.  

 TODD              Okay.  

     He hangs up.  He sits down across from Dussander.  The old man
     is near death, but through the slit of an eye he watches Todd.
     The stare between them is lethal.  For a long moment this
     continues until...

 TODD (CONT'D)              Fuck!  

 DUSSANDER              What?  What is it?  

 TODD              The letter.  Where is the goddamn letter?  I
             told my parents I came over to read you a
             letter from Germany.  

 DUSSANDER              A letter.  Yes, we'll say it's from Willi
             Frankel -- 

 TODD              We need a letter.  I told them it was your
             nephew, I think.  

 DUSSANDER              My bedroom.  Look in the dresser.  Second, no
             third, drawer... from the top.  There is a 
             small wooden box.  You will have to break it 
             open.  I lost the key.  There are letters,
             very old ones.  From a friend.  All in 
             German.  None of them are signed or dated.  A
             page or two will be fine.  

     Todd turns to go and stops.

 TODD              Are you crazy?  I don't read German, you numb
             fuck.  

 DUSSANDER              Why would Willi write me in English?  If you 
             were to read me the letter in German, I would
             understand even though you would not.  Your 
             pronunciation would be terrible, but I could
             manage -- 

 TODD              All right.  All right.  

     Todd dashes out of the room.  


 EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT 
     Dick's Porsche speeds along the same streets that Todd took two
     hours earlier.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of 
     the dresser.  He yanks on the drawer.  It comes half way out and
     stops.  

 TODD              Goddamn you, come out.  

     The drawer flies out, knocking Todd back.  He digs through it, 
     the contents of Dussander's fake lives spilling about the room.
     He finds the box at the bottom.  As he expected, it is locked.
     Without a moment's hesitation, he slams the box down on the post
     of the bed frame.  It doesn't open, but bits of the frame fly
     across the room.  

     On the third attempt the tiny box shatters.  Todd freezes, cocks
     his head.  Outside he hears the distinct ROAR and sputter of the
     Porsche engine.  He grabs two pages of a letter.  There is 
     nothing he can do about the mess in the room.  He closes the 
     door on his way back to the kitchen.


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     Todd enters the kitchen and places the pages on the table just 
     in time to look up and see Dick standing in the kitchen doorway.  

 TODD              Dad.  

     We hold on Dick for a moment as he takes it all in: Dussander,
     Todd, and the room.  A hint of uncertainty crosses his face.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
     A PARAMEDIC straps Dussander onto a stretcher.  Todd is talking
     to the other one.  

 TODD              He started laughing at something in the 
             letter.  I don't know what it was, it's in
             German.

     Dick sees the letter on the table and picks it up.  Todd watches
     him.  Without much of a thought, Dick puts the letter back on
     the table.  

 PARAMEDIC              Well, we'll take care of him now.  We're 
             going to take him to St. Luke's.  It's a good
             thing you called when you did.  You saved his
             life.  

     The medics wheel Dussander out.  

 DICK              You did real good, son.  
                    (looking around the room, as if
                    searching for something)
             You did real good...  

     Todd doesn't like Dick's apprehension.  He grabs his father's
     hand and leads him out of the room.  

 TODD              C'mon.  Let's make sure he gets checked in
             all right.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
     TWO ORDERLIES push a gurney through the door.  A man in his late
     thirties, DAVID KRAUSS, walks with them.  A NURSE, following
     behind, addresses him.

 NURSE              He needs to rest now.  You can come back 
             tomorrow after ten.  

     David approaches the gurney.  Lying prone is BEN KRAUSS, 70.
     David kisses him on the forehead.  

 DAVID              I'll be back in the morning with the girls.  

 BEN              I can't wait to see them.  

     The orderlies lift Ben onto his bed.  

 NURSE                     (to Ben) 
             The doctor will be in to see you in a few
             minutes.

 BEN              Thank you.

     The orderlies, the nurse and David leave the room.  Ben notices
     his roommate in the next bed.  It is Dussander, who has been
     watching all of this quietly.  

 BEN (CONT'D)              My nephew, David.  

     Dussander smiles politely.  

 BEN (CONT'D)              His parents died when he was very young.  He
             is like a son to me.  I have no children of
             my own.

 DUSSANDER              I see.  

 BEN              David is very protective of me.  Of course, I
             don't mind.  I enjoy his company.  A few 
             years ago he started working with me at the
             university.  I teach chemistry.  My name is
             Ben, by the way.  

 DUSSANDER              Arthur.  

 BEN              A pleasure, Arthur.  What do you do?  

 DUSSANDER              I'm retired.  

     Pause.  

 BEN              These tubes in my arm.  No one said they
             would itch like this.  

 DUSSANDER              You will find, in time, you don't notice.  

     Ben looks oddly at Dussander.  The wheels of his memory slowly,
     very slowly, begin to turn.  

 BEN              Well, we'll see.  Looks like I'll be here for
             a while.  I didn't want to alarm my nephew
             just yet, but this break in my leg...  well,
             we'll see what the doctor says.  

 DUSSANDER              Yes, of course.  But for now, you must 
             forgive me, my medication has made me drowsy.
             Do not be offended if I fall asleep.  

 BEN              Don't be offended if I keep talking anyway.  
             It beats wondering if I'm ever going to walk 
             again.  I tell you, my friend, the ways of
             God are not meant to be understood.  

     But Ben's words are lost on a sleeping man.  He continues to
     stare at Dussander.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY 
     Todd comes through the front door, using his key to get in.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY 
     Todd grabs the letter off the table and stuffs it into a plastic
     trash bag.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
     Todd manages to get the drawer back into the dresser.  He throws
     all the remaining debris and bits of wood into the trash bag.  He
     goes to the closet and searches through the clothes.  He 
     finds the S.S. uniform, now tattered from many night of fitful
     sleep, and places it in the trash bag.  


 INT. HILLCREST SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY 
     The BANK CLERK behind the counter is a fat, elderly woman, 
     pleasant-faced and not too sharp.  Todd stands solemnly on the 
     other side of the counter.  She stares hard at a piece of paper.
     We see that it is a note: "Please allow my grandson, Todd, to
     retrieve my insurance documents from my safety deposit box.  
     Thank you, Arthur Denker."  It is Dussander's phony signature
     at the bottom.  

 TODD              He's really sick. ...Please.

     The woman looks up at Todd, the key in his hand, then back down
     at the note.  


 INT. BANK SAFE - DAY 
     The woman inserts her key into the first lock and Todd does the 
     same in the second.  A moment later he is holding the box in his
     hands.  

 BANK CLERK              I sure hope your granddaddy feels better.
             You can bring that in here.  

     She escorts him to a small room where he can view the contents
     of the box.  She leaves.  


 INT. BANK - SMALL ROOM - DAY 
     Todd puts the box on a table and opens it.  It is nearly empty:
     a few old photographs, some financial records.  There is no
     document.  Todd is swept up in a wave of emotion-- anger,
     relief, contempt.  He's been played like a fool, but is 
     nonetheless grateful.  Ultimately, he is so overwhelmed a laugh
     springs from his lips.  

 TODD              Son of a bitch.  

     He scoops out the contents of the box and puts them in his pocket.  


 INT. BANK SAFE - DAY 
     On the other side of the door, the clerk listens curiously to
     Todd's words.  She pushes her ear against the door to hear more.  


 EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK 
     Todd has dug a hole in a remote location.  He empties the
     letters, the S.S. uniform, and the contents from the safety 
     deposit box into the hole.  A little lighter fluid.  A match.
     Todd watches the evidence burn.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
     Todd stands next to the bed holding a small clump of flowers.
     Dussander notices the bouquet.  

 DUSSANDER              You shouldn't have.  

     Todd is aware that Ben is listening, even though he is 
     pretending not to.  Todd goes to put the flowers in a glass of
     water.  He sets the glass on the table by the bed.  

 TODD              They're from my mother.  

     He sits in the chair by the bed and lowers his voice.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Here.  

     He flicks a tattered photo onto the bed.  We recognize it as one 
     from the safety deposit box.  It is a black and white portrait
     of a woman and a small boy.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Everything else I burned.  

     Dussander grins weekly.

 DUSSANDER              I had to protect myself from you, boy.  

     Todd drags a screen over to prevent Ben from hearing.  Long pause.  

 DUSSANDER (CONT'D)              I suspect that we shall never see each other
             again.

 TODD              No, I don't think we will.  

     Dussander looks almost hurt to hear Todd say it.  Pause.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Well, I better go.  

 DUSSANDER              Wait, boy... There is something I want to ask
             you.  

 TODD              What?  

     Dussander waves him over with his finger.  Reluctantly, Todd
     brings his ear an inch from Dussander's mouth.  

 DUSSANDER              ...Was it like you thought?  

     Todd pulls his head back, stands up.  He contemplates the 
     question, ...confessing.  He touches Dussander on the shoulder.  

 TODD              I should go.  

     He turns for the door.  

 DUSSANDER              Perhaps... perhaps I could persuade you to
             wait here just until I fall asleep.  This
             medicine makes me quite woozy... please.  

     Todd resigns himself to stay.  He picks up a magazine and begins
     to read, not even looking at Dussander.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
     Todd emerges from behind the screen toward the door.  Dussander
     is asleep.  

 BEN              Excuse me, young man.  

     Todd is startled.  

 BEN (CONT'D)              You're a fine boy to visit your grandfather
             like that.  

 TODD              Thanks.  But he's just a friend.

 BEN              Is that right?  Well, you are a good friend 
             to him.  Tell me, is he bad off?  He doesn't 
             talk much.

 TODD              The doctors say he'll be out soon.  

 BEN              That is good news, indeed.  Tell me, from the 
             way he speaks I'd guess he's been
             naturalized, like me.  Is he?  

     Todd is starting to be wary of where this is going.  

 TODD              He's from Germany... From Essen.  Do you know
             that town?  

 BEN              I was only in Germany once.  I'm Polish.  
             Originally, I mean, I'm from Radom.  I wonder
             if he was in the war.  

 TODD              I really couldn't say.  

 BEN              It doesn't matter, I suppose.  It was a long
             time ago, the war.  Soon in this country we
             may have a president born after the war was
             over.  How about that?  

     Todd starts to leave.  

 TODD              I'm sure you're right.  

 BEN              Your friend is lucky to have you.  A great 
             man once said, 'No man is an island entire of
             itself.' 

 TODD              John Donne.  Take care, sir.  

     Todd heads for the door.  He stops, turns back to Dussander's
     bed.  He contemplates something... waking him.  He decides
     against it.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Good-bye.  

 BEN              Good-bye.  

     Todd exits.  Ben sits quietly for a moment, thinking.  He turns
     on the television-- "The Price is Right".  We hear it over the
     following.  Ben glances over at the screen which separates him
     from Dussander.  Slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy.  He
     starts to nod off.  But as sleep begins to envelope him, his 
     eyes suddenly fly open.  A surge of terror burns across his
     face.  

     He sits up frightened.  A single crutch stands next to the bed.
     He grabs it.  He strips away his covers and the restraints on 
     his leg, once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell
     a painful scream.  He gets to his feet awkwardly, hobbling, 
     half-dragging his bad leg.  Every step he takes is a study in
     agony.

     ANGLE on the screen.  It slides out of the way, revealing Ben 
     staring down at the sleeping Dussander.  In the pained struggle
     to keep silent, he brings his face right up to Dussander's,
     close enough to smell his breath.  


 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUING 
     Ben stumbles out of his room into the hall.  The crutch falls to
     the ground.  He slides against the wall toward the nurses' 
     station.  Tears stream down his face.  As he clutches the wall,
     we glimpse the faded green numbers on his forearm.  

     He reaches the nurse's desk.  She is on the phone.  He grabs her
     by the shoulder and pulls her face up into his.  She lets out a 
     startled SCREAM.  But Ben's emotion stops her from resisting.  
     He is sobbing uncontrollably.  Orderlies appear and pull him off
     of her.  He collapses to the ground, consumed by grief.  

 BLACK. 

 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander slowly wakes up for the first time since his surgery.  
     A large black man, DARREN, stands above him changing the IV bag.
     He notices Dussander is awake.  Dussander's voice is low and
     hoarse from hours of sedation.  

 DUSSANDER              Where's the nurse?  

 DARREN              My name is Darren.  I'll be taking care of 
             you from now on.  I'll tell the doctor you've
             woken up.  

     Darren finishes with the IV unit and goes to the door.  
     Dussander watches him, a bit puzzled, but his eyes are closed
     again before Darren is out of the room.  


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
     Dussander wakes up again.  Something is different in his room.  
     He looks to the table next to him.  All his magazines are gone.
     He looks to the other side of the room.  Ben is gone, his bed
     stripped of all linen.  Finally he looks to the door.  It is 
     cracked open.  Two men in suits are talking in the hallway.  One
     we will come to know as Detective GETTY.  The other is a
     subordinate.  Dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees.  He
     reaches over for the call button and rings it several times.  

     A moment later Darren comes in.  Getty sees this and stops
     talking.  He watches Dussander from the hall.  

 DARREN              Did you need something?  

 DUSSANDER              What is going on here?  Where is Ben?  

 DARREN              Mr. Krauss has been moved.  I'm going to give
             you something.  It will help you sleep.  

     Darren readies Dussander's arm for an injection.  

 DUSSANDER              I don't want it.  Who is that man?  

     Before Dussander can protest, Darren sticks him with the needle.  

 DARREN              Your surgery was a success.  Just try to
             relax.

 FADE TO BLACK. 

 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 
 WEISKOPF (O.S.)                     (in German)
             Wake up.  Wake up, old man.  

     Dussander's eyes open.  The first thing he sees are three men,
     all in suits, standing over him.  

                          DUSSANDER (in German)
             Are you speaking to me?  

     The voice comes from WEISKOPF, 40's.  His suit is dark gray, 
     well tailored, probably European.  He speaks eloquently despite
     an accent that shows roots of Europe and the Middle East.  

 WEISKOPF                     (back in English)
             No one else is here.  

     Dussander looks over at Ben's former bed.  

 WEISKOPF (CONT'D)              Mr. Krauss is recuperating elsewhere.  Are
             you awake now, Dussander?  

 DUSSANDER              Yes, of course, but you seem to have me
             confused with someone else.  My name is 
             Arthur Denker.  Perhaps you want a different
             room -- 

     Weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed.  Dussander notices the pin
     on his lapel.  A small, silver Star of David.  

 WEISKOPF              My name is Weiskopf.  You are Kurt Dussander.  

 DUSSANDER              I know no one by that name.  Shall I ring for
             the nurse?  

     Dussander reaches for the Call button and stops in horror.  He 
     looks at his hands.  His fingertips are smeared with black ink.
     He looks up at the men in disbelief.  

 WEISKOPF              The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss.
             He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin.
             You were responsible for the death of his 
             wife and two daughters.  His identification
             of you was quite specific.  I'm sure his 
             reward from my government will help offset
             the burden of his broken leg.  

 DUSSANDER              My name is Arthur Denker.  I am an American-- 

 WEISKOPF              Please don't bother.  Your papers will not 
             stand up to serious examination and you know
             it.  

     The detective, GETTY, snaps a few pictures of Dussander.  The
     other man is FBI Special Agent DAN RICHLER.  

 RICHLER              We have all we need here, Isaac.  

 DUSSANDER              Who are you men?  What are your names?  

 RICHLER              My name is Richler, FBI.  This is Detective
             Getty from the Orange County Sheriff's
             Department.  

 WEISKOPF              And I think you know who I work for.  When
             you get your strength back, you will be 
             moved.  Until then, this entire ward will be
             under surveillance.  You can expect to be in
             Tel Aviv by the end of the summer.  

     The three men are out the door.  


 INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
     Todd's room is dark as he lies on the floor, writing something 
     on a pile of index cards.  The only light comes from the hallway
     through the open door of the bedroom.  Todd is deep in thought,
     but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the
     writing is not coming easily.  

 TODD              The road ahead reveals itself, uh, God, no.
             The road ahead... grrrr, The fucking road
             ahead.

     Monica appears in the doorway.  

 MONICA              Todd?

     Todd doesn't notice her.  He stares down at the card.  Finally he
     looks up, as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in
     his mind.  His response is hardly audible.  

 TODD              Huh?  

 MONICA              What are you doing there in the dark?  

 TODD              Oh, ...working.  

     Monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light.  She touches
     the switch but then pulls her hand back.  Todd is back at the 
     note card.  She looks at him oddly, worried, but then steps away
     from the door and goes downstairs.

     Todd's lips are moving, as if he were speaking to himself.  He
     pauses.  Then, in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write
     furiously.  He finishes and stands up, catching his reflection 
     in the mirror above his desk.  In the eerie half-light, he
     stares at the ghost-like image of himself.  


 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD (GRADUATION) - DAY 
     Todd, in cap and gown, is seeing his parents to their seats in 
     the second row.  Ed French comes up to Todd and puts his hand on
     his shoulder.  Todd is startled.  

 TODD              Mr. French.  

 FRENCH              Hello, Todd.  It's your big day, isn't it?  

     They shake hands.  French sees Dick and Monica sitting behind
     Todd.  Before Todd can stop him, he introduces himself.  

 FRENCH (CONT'D)              These must be your parents.
                    (extends hand) 
             Hi, Ed French.  It's good to finally meet
             you.  

     Dick and Monica are the picture of happiness, hardly the
     dysfunctional drunkards that French believed them to be.  They 
     all shake hands.  

 DICK              Dick Bowden, nice to meet you.  This is my
             wife, Monica.  

 MONICA              Are you one of Todd's teachers?  

     French is a bit puzzled.  

 FRENCH              No.  I'm his guidance counsellor.  

     A WOMAN behind Monica taps her on the shoulder.  

 WOMAN              Monica, I thought that was you.  

     Monica turns away from French.  Suddenly, the band strikes up
     opening notes to "Pomp and Circumstance."

 TODD                     (to French)
             That's our cue.  

 FRENCH                     (to Dick) 
             It was nice meeting you.  

 DICK              You too.  
                    (to Todd)
             Good luck, son.  

 FRENCH              I'll talk to you and your wife after the
             ceremony.  

     Todd and French dash off in different directions.  


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - LATER 
     Standing at the podium is a black, female graduate, TASHA 
     LITTLE.  She is reading the end of a poem by Emily Dickinson.  
     Principal Morgan and Todd sit in chairs next to the podium. In
     the b.g. is the graduating class, Joey is among them.   French
     sits among the faculty, who are lined up to the right of the
     podium.  

 TASHA              Thy sacred emblems to partake -
             Thy consecrated bread to take 
             And thine immortal wine!  

     There is polite applause from the audience as she takes her seat
     and Morgan goes to the podium.  

 MORGAN              Thank you, Miss Little for that superb
             invocation.

     Pause.  More applause.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              And now it gives me great pleasure to
             introduce a young man who's academic 
             achievement at this institution stands as
             testament to the power of hard work and 
             determination.  Todd had a tough time a few
             months ago, so by God, he buckled down, hit
             the books, and pulled himself through it.  

     Todd's eyes scan the crowd indifferently.  He notices Becky,
     seated in the audience near some friends.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              Ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty,
             here to deliver the student remembrance for 
             the class of 1985, this year's valedictorian,
             Todd Bowden.

     The crowd burst into applause.  


 EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY 
     A half dozen police cars are in front of the house.  One OFFICER
     is blocking off the entire yard with yellow tape.  A news van
     pulls up.


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING 
     Todd shakes Morgan's hand and takes the podium.  The crowd
     quiets.  Todd begins: 

 TODD              We all have dreams that we carry with us.
             Perhaps it is a dream of prosperity, or 
             happiness.  But now, so early in our lives, 
             it seems that all we should ask for is to be
             at peace with the world, because only then
             can we be at peace with ourselves.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY 
     Weiskopf and Richler, both wearing rubber gloves, are carefully
     looking through the contents of Dussander's dresser.  They pour
     over everything, placing some items in clear plastic bags.  A
     few DEPUTIES are milling around.  Richler picks up a small
     photograph of a young woman.  Todd's voice comes in: 

 TODD (V.O.)              We learn from our education that we are the 
             master's of our own destinies.  We learn what
             it is that separates us from the others, why
             we are special.  

 RICHLER              What about this?  

 WEISKOPF              Yes.  All photographs.  

     Detective Getty comes in.

 GETTY              You boys better come down to the cellar.
             You're not going to believe this.  


 INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - DAY 
     Getty comes down the steps followed by Weiskopf and Richler.
     Weiskopf gazes across the cellar.  Whatever he sees disturbs
     him.  He turns away and goes back up the stairs.  

 TODD (V.O.)              Each of us have unique talents and interests
             unlike those of anyone else.  The challenge 
             now, as we stand at the doorway to adulthood,
             is to channel our abilities into our goals.  

     Richler, moves to the rail and looks out, disgusted.  He pulls a
     handkerchief from his pocket and covers his nose and mouth.  A
     DEPUTY, wearing rubber gloves, carries the shovel up to him.  


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING 
     As Todd speaks, he notices his parents, Becky, various teachers.
     His eyes stop on Ed French, who is looking oddly at something in
     the crowd.  

 ANGLE ON FRENCH 
     French notices an elderly couple walking down the aisles of
     seated spectators as if they are looking for someone.  

 TODD (O.C.)              We forge our own paths.  Our education is but
             a stepping stone to the world.  

     They are Victor and Agnes Bowden, looking for Dick and Monica.
     Todd sees them too.  He pauses almost imperceptibly.  He looks
     back at French.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Our.. Our true destinies await us.  There we
             become the...

     Todd's grandparents come down the aisle to see Dick and Monica
     in the second row.  They start to slide in, causing a slight
     ruckus.  Dick is surprised to see his parents, but smiles and
     makes room for them.  French watches all of this curiously.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              There we become the men and women that will
             make a difference.  But we must take away 
             from this place a sense of purpose for
             ourselves.  We now begin to see the road 
             ahead.  It is a road from which we cannot
             veer.

     A connection is made between French, Todd, and the Bowden
     family.


 EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - LATER 
     Morgan is reading the last of the names as the graduates file
     past and collect their diplomas.  

 MORGAN              Andrew Woodman... Donald Young... Karmisha 
             Youngblood... David Zedek... Kyle Zuckerman.
             The graduating class of 1985.  

     The crowd cheers as the graduates throw their caps into the air.
     The band begins to play.  

 MORGAN (CONT'D)              Now we invite all the friends and parents to
             join the students and faculty in the main
             courtyard for refreshments.  

     Todd, still pale, bolts off the stage.  He reaches his parents.
     French starts to walk down to the Bowdens.  Todd goes up to his
     mother.  

 MONICA              Honey.  

 TODD              Mom, I don't feel so good.  

 MONICA              What's wrong?  

 TODD              I don't know, I feel like I'm going to pass
             out.  Can we go home?  

 AGNES              You looked real good up there, Todd.  

     Todd ignores her.  

 DICK              Don't you want to see your buddies?  

 TODD              I want to go, Dad.  Right now.  

     Todd and his family start off.  As they leave the CAMERA MOVES
     to show Ed French working his way through the crowd past the
     spot where they had been standing.


 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
     The following series of images appear under music:

     The quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied 
     sea of reporters, cameramen, photographers, and police officers.
     Everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity
     through the window that looks into Dussander's room.  Inside, 
     Weiskopf and Richler are speaking to the doctors.  Getty stands
     to the side, instructing the DEPUTY who guards the door.  

     Through all of this Dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as
     the bodies whirl around him.  Darren enters the room to change
     Dussander's IV bag.  

     Suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in,
     snapping pictures wildly.  Getty and the other officers descend
     upon him.  The camera flashes.  Other photographers try to get
     in but are blocked.  Pandemonium.  

     Yet Dussander seems oblivious to the commotion.  His eyes are
     nothing more than glazed slits, his mouth hangs open.  Darren 
     runs toward the door to help.  Dussander's eyes open slightly.
     There is life behind them after all.  He turns his attention
     imperceptibly toward his IV bag...  

     The camera moves away from Dussander to the window.  Outside in
     the parking lot, groups of protesters have gathered.  Some hold 
     candles.  Others chant and wave signs.  News reporters surround 
     them.


 INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY 
     ANGLE on a ticking wall clock.  

     Todd appears apprehensive as he sits down on the couch next to 
     his mother.  She puts her arm around him.  He is pale and
     glassy-eyed.  His parents don't look much better.  Dick is
     especially nervous and stands off to the side, watching everyone
     intently.  Richler and Weiskopf sit across the room in chairs.  

 RICHLER              Todd, my name is Dan Richler.  I'm a special 
             agent with the FBI.  This is my associate, Dr.
             Weiskopf.  

 WEISKOPF              Hello.  

 DICK              What kind of doctor are you?  

 WEISKOPF              I'm a school teacher.  

 RICHLER              Dr. Weiskopf is a professor at the Judaic
             Institute in Munich.  He is assisting the 
             Israeli government in certain matters.  He is
             here today, only as an observer.  

     A moment passes between Weiskopf and Todd.  

 RICHLER (CONT'D)              Thanks for calling us up, Mr. Bowden.  You 
             saved us the trouble of tracking through the
             911 records.

 DICK              Actually, it was Todd's idea to call.  He 
             thought... we thought there might be some way
             we could help your investigation.  

 RICHLER              Todd, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to hear
             about your involvement with Dussander... but
             you knew him as Arthur Denker, right?

 TODD              Yeah.  I never knew of that other name till I
             saw it in the paper.

 RICHLER              How did you know him?  

     Todd starts to rub his stomach.

 TODD              I met him at the movies.  Last summer.  ...He
             asked me where to pick up the number seven
             bus.  He said his eyes weren't too good.
             ...Will you excuse me for a minute?  

     He gets up before Richler can answer walks toward the stairs.  

 MONICA              You okay, honey?  

 TODD              I just gotta use the bathroom.  I'll be right
             back.  

     He vanishes up the stairs.  They all watch him go.  Monica turns
     to Richler.

 MONICA              He's not feeling well.  

     ANGLE on Dick.

 MONICA (CONT'D)              Can I get you some coffee?  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
     The faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as Todd digs 
     through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of Pepto-
     Bismol.  He takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the
     bottle.  He finishes and takes a few deep breaths.  

     As he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror.  An
     empty bottle in his hand, a bright pink ring around his lips, a 
     few pink splotches down his shirt-- he looks totally ridiculous.
     Todd can't help but laugh.  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
     The interview continues.  The clock ticks on.  Richler drinks
     from a coffeee cup.  Todd is back in his seat.  

 RICHLER              Todd, let me tell you what we're really 
             interested in here.  You told the admitting 
             nurse that Denker had a heart attack while 
             you were reading him a letter.

 TODD              That's right.  I was.  That's what I was
             doing there.  It was in German but he 
             insisted I try to read it anyway.  Once or
             twice he got pissy about the pronunciation 
             but I asked him what did he want from me.  I
             don't speak German.  Mr. Denker...
             Dussander... got really excited at one point.
             He yelled out, "Yes, that's what you would do
             all right." but I didn't know what he was 
             talking about.  Then he grabbed his chest.  

 RICHLER              And that's when you called the ambulance,
             right?

 TODD              That's right.  

 RICHLER              Well, this is the part we can't figure out.
             The letter itself, Todd... do you remember
             what happened to it?  

 TODD              I guess it was still on the table.  I
             couldn't swear to it, but --

 DICK              Wait, I saw a letter.  It was in German.  I
             didn't think anything of it at the time.
             But, yeah, it was on Airmail stationery.  

 RICHLER              Then it should still be there.  This is our
             problem.  

 DICK              It isn't?  

 RICHLER              No.  

 MONICA              Maybe somebody broke in.  

 RICHLER              Why would somebody break into his house 
             simply to steal a letter? ...Unless... there
             was someone... someone right here in Santo
             Donato who would want to protect him for some 
             reason.  Maybe a close friend, or even 
             another fugitive.  I know it sounds like a
             bunch of Robert Ludlum stuff, but when
             Dussander was taken to the hospital, we think
             our Mr. X scooted over to the house and
             swiped the letter.  

 TODD              That doesn't make sense.  

 RICHLER              Why not, Todd?  

 TODD              Well, if Denk... if he had an old Nazi buddy
             in town, why didn't he come over himself and
             read the letter to him?  If you could have 
             heard the way he corrected me at every word--

 RICHLER              A good point.  Except maybe this other fellow 
             is in a wheelchair, or blind.  

 TODD              Guys that are blind don't normally go
             scooting out to steal letters.

 RICHLER                     (smiling) 
             True.  Did Dussander have any friends that
             you knew of?  

 TODD              No, not really.  

 RICHLER              How about phone calls?  

     Pause.  

 TODD              No, I heard his phone ring maybe five or six
             times in all the time I knew him.  It was
             never anything out of the ordinary.
             Salesmen.  Wrong numbers.  

 RICHLER              Did you ever hear him speak German on those
             occasions?  

 TODD              No.  He hardly ever spoke German.  He always
             said he would teach me someday, but he never 
             got around to it.  

 WEISKOPF              Did he ever talk about his past?  

     Todd looks at Weiskopf.  This is the first question he has asked
     and Todd is more wary of him than of Richler.  Todd shrugs
     innocently.

 TODD              Not really.  Little bits, I guess.  

 MONICA              Well, don't you remember what he told us at
             Thanksgiving?

     Todd looks at her.  

 MONICA (CONT'D)              He said he was in college-- 

 DICK                     (shutting her up) 
             Monica.  They don't care what we know, they
             care what Todd knows.  

     Silence.  Richler notices the tension in the room.  He looks at
     Weiskopf.  Finally, he speaks to Dick.  

 RICHLER              Look, I'm sure this whole thing has come as a
             terrible shock.  I think we've done enough
             for the day.  

     He and Weiskopf stand.  Dick is almost surprised that they are
     leaving so soon.  

 WEISKOPF              Thank you, Todd.  Mr. and Mrs. Bowden.  

     Weiskopf nods good-bye.  

 DICK              Wait a minute... Agent Richler, before you 
             go--  Todd's not a suspect in this, is he?  I
             mean he's just talking to you, right?  

 RICHLER              That's right.  

 DICK              Because Todd always thought he was helping 
             that old man.  We didn't know any of this
             before today.  

 RICHLER              Mr. Bowden, you and Todd have nothing to 
             worry about.  I assure you.  Your son has 
             been a great service to us.  Thank you, Todd.
             For now that's all we need.  Our next step is
             to turn that house upside down.  We're
             bringing in some special teams to look 
             through everything.  We may come up with 
             something.  We'll be in touch if we need you.  

     They are almost to the door, when Richler stops.  

 RICHLER (CONT'D)              Oh, Todd, by the way....
                    (casually, pulls a photo out of a
                    folder he is carrying) 
             Have you ever seen this man before?  

     He holds the photo up to Todd.  It is a picture of Archie in
     military dress, probably a blow-up of his military ID.  Todd
     stares at it for a moment.  His face shows no reaction.

 TODD              No.  

 RICHLER              Okay, thanks.  

     He smiles.  Weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave.  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY 
     From his window Todd sees Richler and Weiskopf talking by their
     gray sedan.  

 TODD              You'll be back, won't you boys?  Won't you,
             Special agent Jackoff.  You and the sheeny 
             professor. ...I know, let's show him an old
             army picture, that'll screw him up. ...Fuck
             you.  Fuck-You.


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
     Dick is half-way up the stairs when he hears yelling coming from
     Todd's room.  He pauses a moment.  Most of Todd's words aren't
     clear, but the profanity sure is...  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY 
     After a moment, the sedan pulls away.  Todd turns away from the
     window and we see that he is holding the barrel of the rifle in 
     one hand and the scope in the other.  

     He takes a few breaths, tries to calm down.  A burst of nervous
     laughter slips out of him.  

     There is a KNOCK at the door.  Two seconds later Dick comes in.  

     DICK'S POV: Todd stands in the middle of his room.  The gun
     pieces are nowhere in sight.  

 DICK              Everything all right, son?  

 TODD              Yeah... fine.  

 DICK              You sure?  

 TODD              I'm fine, Dad.  

 DICK              Your mother and I feel terrible... like we...  

 TODD              It's not your fault.  

     Dick grabs his son and pulls him close.  Todd doesn't know how
     to respond.  For Dick, it is like hugging a phone pole.  He 
     knows something is terribly wrong.  Todd stands stiff in his
     father's arms until he releases him.  

 DICK              You know we love you, don't you?  

 TODD              I know, Dad.  

     He smiles at his father, comfortingly.  Dick is not comforted.  

 DICK              Look, ahh, your mother and I are going to go
             down and talk to our lawyer.  I don't want
             you to worry about a thing.  It's just a 
             precaution.  I don't trust these cops.  We're
             not going to be gone long.

 TODD              Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.  

 DICK              Your old man is on top of things, all right?
             I am going to take care of this.  

 TODD              I know, Dad.  

     Dick kisses Todd's forehead.  He turns to leave and stops.  

 DICK              This afternoon, if you're up for it, we'll go
             do something.  How 'bout it?  

 TODD              Sure.  

     Dick tries to smile and goes out, the door, leaving Todd alone.


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     The garage door opens and Dick backs the Porsche into the
     street.  Monica is with him.  Todd, from the upstairs window, 
     watches them go.  


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 
     Todd is near the end of his rope, trying to hold himself
     together.  We see him splashing water on his face in the 
     bathroom.  He gazes into the mirror, transfixed by the ghost- 
     like image reflected back at him.  Todd pounds his fist against
     the sink.  He can stand it no longer.  He darts out of the
     bathroom.  


 EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY 
     Todd drives his mother's Honda wagon towards the entrance of the
     hospital and for the first time witnesses the scope of
     Dussander's discovery.  News vans are everywhere.  The 
     protesters have grown in number.  A line of cars wait for 
     admittance into the parking lot.  A policeman stands a few feet
     away from Todd, directing cars in, turning others away.  He is
     moving toward Todd.  Horns honk around him.  Todd sees that more
     police officers are standing by the door of the hospital.  The
     nearby policeman notices Todd and walks closer.  Todd doesn't
     wait.  He pulls the car out of line and drives off.


 INT. HONDA WAGON - DAY 
     Todd holds the steering wheel with a white-knuckled grip.  His 
     face is sweaty and flushed.  He rocks back and forth as he tries
     to reassure himself...  

 TODD              We're okay.  We're okay.  We're o-kay.

     He is almost calm when he nears his house.  But it doesn't last.
     He sees something he can hardly believe.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              You got to be fucking kidding me.


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     An old Vo1vo is parked on the street in front of the house.
     Standing on the porch, sneakers and all, is Ed French.  Todd 
     pulls into the driveway and gets out.  French has a cautious air
     about him as he walks toward Todd.  

 FRENCH              Hello, Todd.  

 TODD              Mr. French, what brings you to the wild side
             of town?  

     The two of them are standing on opposites sides of the car.  
     French pulls a folded newspaper page from his pocket.  He starts
     to move around the car toward Todd, but Todd circles the other
     way, keeping the car in between himself and French.  

 FRENCH              Todd... I found something troubling in the
             morning news.  Are your parents home?  

 TODD              No.  

 FRENCH              I know the man in this picture is the man who
             came to see me.  

 TODD              It's sort of a bad time right now.  Why don't
             you go home?  

 FRENCH              I will.  But first I need a couple of things
             explained to me.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Richler is speaking to the reporters.  Cameras and lights are in
     his face.  His words are low, serving as a backdrop, but we can 
     tell that he is telling them of the plans to relocate Dussander.
     Weiskopf stands close by...  

 FRENCH (V.O.)              Todd, why don't you tell me what happened?  


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     While Todd almost seems to be enjoying this odd dance around the
     car, French does not.  

 TODD              You know, Mr. French, sometimes one thing
             just leads to another and before you know 
             it... things get out of control.

 FRENCH              I'm afraid that's not much of an answer, 
             Todd.  When do you expect your parents home?  

 TODD              I don't know, Ed.  You want to come in and 
             wait?  I'll put on a pot of tea.  We'll talk
             about old times.  

 FRENCH              I think you might need some help, Todd.
             That's why I'm here.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander is alone in the room as Richler addresses the 
     reporters outside.  His eyes open wide and his movements are the
     liveliest they have been since he was discovered.  He reaches 
     over to his IV unit and begins to disconnect the tube from the
     bag...

 TODD (V.O.)              You know?  You're right.  I do need help.  I
             really do.  


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     Todd becomes more animated, more threatening with every word.
     Somehow it is as though French is now retreating from Todd as
     they circle the car.  

 FRENCH              Let me help you, Todd.  I want to.  You're
             too smart to do anything crazy.

 TODD              Can I ask you something, Ed?  You don't mind
             if I call you Ed, now that I'm out of your
             fucking school, do you?  

 FRENCH              What?  

 TODD              You know all this crap you see on TV about
             forensics... hairs and fibers, that stuff?  
             How much of it do think is true and how much
             is just bullshit?  

     French is puzzled by the question.  He has no answer.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              Oh, how would you know?  You're a fucking
             guidance counsellor.

     French stops.  

 FRENCH              Todd, this is silly.  Why don't we go inside?  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Liquid spills onto the floor as the tube comes loose from the
     bag.  Dussander sits back and pulls the free end of the tube up
     to his mouth.  His lips wrap around it and his face tightens as 
     he begins to blow....


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     Todd starts moving again.  French does the same.  

 TODD              Here's a little factoid for ya.  I'll bet you
             didn't know this one.  Hairs fall out of your
             head all the time.  But it's even worse when
             you're nervous.  And you know what?  I've
             been real fucking high-strung lately.  

     Todd comes around the rear of the car and stops at the door to
     the back seat.  He opens it.  

 FRENCH              Listen, Todd... Please.  

     Todd bends down to get something from the back seat.  His voice
     is muffled from the inside of the car.

 TODD              That's how it all happened, you know.  One 
             thing lead to another and before I knew it...

     Todd pops back up holding the rifle, fully assembled and aimed
     at French's chest.  

 TODD (CONT'D)              ...you showed up in my driveway, wearing
             those same fucking sneakers.  

 FRENCH              Whoa.  To--

     Todd rapid-fires.  French's chest explodes red as his lifeless
     body sails back onto the grass.  In the front yard, a dozen
     birds evacuate a tree in a panicked exodus.  Todd swoons back on
     his heels, overcome by something.  But it isn't pain, rather,
     it's a rush of pleasure.  A laugh slips out.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander takes the tube from his mouth and lets it fall to the
     floor.  The camera moves along the tube and stops at Dussander's
     arm, where it ends.  He lies back in his bed and waits...


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 
     Todd regains his balance.  French stares wide-eyed as Todd steps
     up to him, the muzzle aimed at French's head.  Todd grins
     widely.  For the first time he looks ...happy.

     A single round obliterates half of French's skull.  Todd chokes
     back a giggle like a drunk chokes back a belch.  


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     Dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic, contortive fit as
     the air embolism reaches his heart.  His arm flails against the 
     IV unit, sending it crashing to the floor.  The monitors next to
     him reflect a drastic turn in his condition.  The door flies
     open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of 
     journalists.  Richler and Weiskopf run in and the eager 
     cameramen follow.  The room is bathed in flash explosions as the
     nurses try to subdue Dussander.


 INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY 
     Todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the
     boxes and boxes of ammunition.  He lets out a beautifully wicked
     laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack.  He
     leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his
     shoulder.


 EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - STREET - DAY 
     Todd zooms out of the garage on his bike, the rifle slung over
     one shoulder, the backpack over the other.  He zips past
     French's body and out into the street.  In the distance, we hear
     the faint, but rising wail of sirens.  

     A front door or two slams shut as Todd passes.  Suddenly he cuts
     up between two houses.  A man standing in his back yard sees 
     Todd and freezes.  Todd ignores him.  He steers the bike through
     the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times 
     before.


 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY 
     From above we see Dussander's eyes, wide open, motionless.  Yet 
     the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction.  A doctor
     pounds on his chest, barks orders.  The trauma team prepares the
     defibrillator, but we know they are too late...


 EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY 
     Todd rides fast over the dry, rocky ground.  The wind streaks
     back his hair.  His excitement is as palpable as the grin
     dancing across his face.  

     An aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail 
     and up a steep embankment.  As the camera moves ahead of him, we
     see the crest of the hill, and beyond it...  

     The freeway, teeming with rush-hour traffic.  

 BLACK.

          As the conversation continues we see:
                         
          1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany
          table.
                         
          2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting
          room.
                         
          3. An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long
          winding staircase.

          And right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER
          (60) -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a
          CAMERA CREW, mid-interview. ELLEN MILLER (58) watches on a
          nearby MONITOR.
                         
                          ROBERT

                          (LAUGHING)
           Was this freshman econ?
                         
                          ROBERT
           This was fifth-grade econ.
           (smiles, off her laugh)
           But this is something we've seen
           over and over again, time and time
           again, that competition for this--
           limited amount of dollars out
           there, can make even the best of us
           manic. So it's not surprising that
           we see these asset bubbles, but
           when reality sets in of course,
           they burst.
                         
          CUT TO BLACK.

          FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH
                         
          And we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine,
          as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing...
                         
                         
          INT. FALCON
                         
          A sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas.
                         
          At the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed
          tones, pouring over a sea of red-inked paper.
                         
          In the galley, GAVIN BRIAR (42), pours a coffee. He brings it
                         BACK TO
                         
                         ROBERT
                         
          who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit,
          scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT
          DOCUMENTS. His effortless slouch, silver hair, and all-
          commanding mannerisms make one thing clear: Robert's our man.
                         
                          GAVIN
           (handing him the coffee)
           Here you go...
                         
          Robert sips it.

                          GAVIN (CONT'D)
                          (SITTING)
           You're disappointed.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Quants? Derivatives structures?
           What was that about?
                         
                          GAVIN
           It makes no sense.
                         
                          ROBERT
           That's what you said last week.
           Why'd we go down there?
                         
                          GAVIN
           To sign.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And did we sign?
                         
                          GAVIN
           No.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No. We did not. Instead I fly two
           thousand miles for a marketing
           meeting... And where was Mayfield?
           What was this "emergency"? What was
           that about?
                         
                          GAVIN
           (after a beat)
           Did you speak to the auditors?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Why?
                         
                          GAVIN
           What if... we don't don't close this
           week...
                         
          We push into a close-up of Robert, as he contemplates what
          this would mean.
                         
                         
          EXT. WESTCHESTER AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The ROAR of thirty million dollars landing near tall grass.
                         
                         
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Robert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac,
          followed by Gavin and the aides.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 4.
                         
          They approach a waiting MERCEDES MAYBACH. The aides hand file
          BOXES and BRIEFCASES to the Hispanic driver, RAMON, who loads
          them into the trunk.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The blur of city lights as the limo passes over bridges and
          towards the city and Park Avenue and finally approaches
                         
                         
          EXT. GRACIE SQUARE - ROBERT'S MANSION - CONTINUOUS
                         
          An enormous turn-of-the-last-century Stanford-White-designed
          red-brick MANSION- two already-giant townhouses combined.
          Robert and Gavin exit the limo and head inside.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS
                         
          It's our first glimpse of Robert's home, and it doesn't
          disappoint. It's an 1850's Tudor given a full once-over,
          maintaining period details but updated with a Modernist
          flair. It actually works.
                         
          A SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters,
          handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm.
                         
          We HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN
          laughing. Hold on Robert's face- some mixture of excitement
          and anticipation.
                         
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A party in progress, dinner already served.
                         
          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's
          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's
          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and
          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.
                         
          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (LIGHTING UP)
           Look, your grandfather's here!
                         
          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the
          table, hugging them all.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Hi, guys!
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.
                         
                          GRANDCHILD
           Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?
                         
          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a
          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to
          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.
                         
          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast
          to his behavior towards their kids.
                         
                          BROOKE
           It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.
           You're spoiling them rotten.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (GRINNING)
           It's my job! It's my job. You guys
           turned out fine!
                         
                          BROOKE
                          (HALF-SMILE)
           Debatable.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (to Peter, as they hug and
                          SMILE)
           How you doin', son? Good?
                         
          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as
          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.
                         
                          ELLEN
           We had to eat. The kids were
           starving...
                         
                          ROBERT
           (hugging her, happy)
           No, no that's okay. Where's my
           drink, is this mine, here?
                         
          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday
          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.
                         
                          ALL
           HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!
                         
          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a
          toast.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Thank you, thank you, thank you all
           very much, it's such a surprise, I
           didn't even know it was my birthday!
                         
          Everyone laughs a little.

           What did Mark Twain say about? He
           said-- old age... is clearly a case
           of mind over matter. If you don't
           mind, it doesn't matter.
                          (MORE LAUGHTER)
           I've done a lot of things in my life,
           worked very hard, but being here,
           looking around-- at all these shining,
           radiant faces, I know that my best
           work is right here in this room, right
           now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.
           That's the best gift your mother and I
           could have hoped for,

           ...and to have sold the company
           to Standard this morning!
                         
          They all LAUGH.

           That, too, Peter, but- no business
           tonight-- no business!
                         
                          ELLEN
           Oh, here we go!
                         
          More group LAUGHTER.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Although your one-track mind assures
           me you've got not only your mother's
           genes, but you've got mine, too!
                         
          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter
          across the room.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, I'm aware that may seem
           uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me
           sixty years to realize what's truly
           important -- and it's you guys so thank
           you all very much.

          Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests
          with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.

           Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel
           about that. Trash can.

           Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?
                         
          Brooke leans back and stares at him.

           Why sell our company? We make a

                          ROBERT
           My darling, you are still in your 20's.
           I am 60. That's a big difference in
           point of view.

                          (LAUGHS)
           It catches up alright. And maybe
           there's some other things I'd like to
           do. Maybe I would like to spend a
           little more time with you guys...

           What?
                         
          Staring at him, then

           Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.
                         
          She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.

          He kisses her and starts to exit. She stares as he walks out.
          Hold on her.

          entrance. Robert exits, paying the DRIVER through the window.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (into his phone)
           Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When
           you get this -- I want you to call

          INT. LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          JULIE CÔTE (32) sits at the head of a marble table in the
          exquisite space. It's the modern mirror of Robert's mansion,
          the lines carried through fully this time. And Julie is the
          modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home.
                         
          She's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack
          of INVITATIONS for the "Julie Côte Gallery - Paintings by Victor
          Rodriguez - April 10th" as she downs the last of a WHITE WINE.
          She's got a seating chart out that she's working on.
                         
          The INTERCOM RINGS. Julie heads over, sees Robert's face on
          the VIDEO MONITOR. She holds a beat.

          EXT. LOFT APARTMENT - SAME
                         
          Robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as Julie
          watches him from inside the loft, not moving.
                         
          After a second, the door BUZZES open.
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - SAME
                         
          Robert enters. Julie is already back at the table, writing.
          She's arranging 4 POLAROIDS of different paintings on a wall,
          along with a SEATING CHART. He walks down the long hall.
                         
          He comes up behind her, running his arms across her stomach.
                         
                          JULIE
           (standing in frustration)
           Okay...
                         
          She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine,
          lights a cigarette. Robert trails.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm
           late. I'm always late-- you know
           that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm
           always saying I'm sorry about being
           late.
           (crosses to her)
           It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather
           be here with you.
                         
          They stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette, then
          stubs it out. He gestures to the dining table.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           The show's gonna be beautiful.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (FINALLY--)
           You gonna be there?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (slight beat, then
                          DEFINITIVE)
           I will be there.
                         
          She stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge
          and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (LAUGHING)
           Oh wow, that's great.

                          JULIE
           I made this for you.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You made this? This is amazing. One
           candle, thank you very...
                         
          She reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her
          hand and... SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE.
                         
          The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they
          kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes
          him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love.
                         
                         
          INT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY
                         
          Robert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate
          18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark
          contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking
          British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive
          glass conference room. They arrive at
                         
                         
          INT. GREENBERG'S OFFICE - SAME
                         
          The receptionist escorts Robert in. Standing to greet him is
          JEFFREY GREENBERG (53), handsome and charming.
                         
                          JEFFREY
           Thank you, Diane.
                         
          She exits. Robert sits. A moment of silence.
                         
                          JEFFREY (CONT'D)
           So?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm here.

           hundred twelve million dollars that's
           sitting in your account so you can
           pass your audit, the four hundred
           twelve million that you needed, you
           said, for two weeks, and which has
           been languishing now for
           (looks down at paper)
           thirty-two days, while it could be
           elsewhere invested, earning an actual
           return, instead of couching the absurd
           lie that you're spinning.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What do you want me to say?
                         
                          JEFFREY
           That you're gonna get a signature
           from Mayfield, and that my hostage
           money and my fee are going to be sent
           to me promptly, say... by tomorrow?

           I am solving the problem. I am getting
           you your money and your fee. You will
           have them very shortly.
                         
                          JEFFREY
           When?
                         
                          ROBERT
           As soon as they sign the contract.
                         
                          JEFFREY
                          (BEAT)
           You know, I'm not the one with the
           liability, pal. I just made a loan.
           You're looking at jail for a
           thousand years for fraudulent

                          JEFFREY
           ...remember when you asked me if it
           was a good idea to divert half your
           liquid assets into a fucking copper
           mine? What did I tell you?

           Are we done here? I think we're
           done here.
                         
          Jeffrey stares at him contemplatively for a moment, then
          appears to reach some sort of conclusion.

                          ROBERT
           ...I need the money there until they
           sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?
                         
                          JEFFREY
           That's really not my problem, is it?

           morning on new housing starts to
           rise 132 points. Asian markets fared
           less well, especially in Russia,
           where further nationalization plans
           caused foreign investment to
           sputter, leading to various...

          His phone VIBRATES a TEXT, from Julie: "See you at 8!" He
          stares at it, breathes in deeply.

           Seven-thirty tonight at the Four Seasons.
           We'll get it straight with Mayfield then.

          Ellen stands tying Robert's TIE in front of a dressing mirror.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Is this too blue?
                         
                          ELLEN
           It's the third one you've tried.
                         
          She finishes tying it. He looks in the mirror.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Ay, yay yay. I look old.
                         
                          ELLEN
           You look regal, and wise, and granted
           a little worried. What is going on?
           Are you afraid of this meeting?
                         
                          ROBERT
           They haven't signed the papers.
                         
                          ELLEN
           I thought that's why you flew down there.

           (rubbing his eyes)
           So did I, but for some reason
           they're stalling. I didn't get any
           sleep on the plane and...
                         
                          ELLEN
           Now come on. It will all work out.
           Just follow the plan.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What plan is that?

           You sound like a fortune cookie.
                         
                          ELLEN
           They're your words, actually.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Then you married an idiot.

                          (BEAT)
           Okay, but I was thinking, idiot,
           that, after the deal is done, which
           it definitely will be, why don't we
           just take off? Pete's in the best
           place he's ever been, your daughter
           is always as brilliant, right? So,
           I wanna have some fun. I wanna have
           fun with you!

           Let's go to Ravello- the house there.
           We haven't been there forever..

                          ELLEN
           We have to make time. We go for a
           year. Let's take a year and get fat
           and have fun and go on an adventure. I
           mean-- seriously-- how much money do
           we need?. Do you wanna be the richest

           Oh, by the way, Mary called from St.

           I've had to move some things around
           for the merger.
                         
                          ELLEN
           It's only two million.

           EXT. JULIE CÔTE GALLERY - A LITTLE LATER
                         
           Robert exits his MAYBACH in front of a big scene in progress:
           trendy FOLKS overflowing into the street, cameras FLASHING...
                         
                         
           INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
           The space is cavernous, modern luxe -- a Liagre design with
           thirty-foot columns and slab granite. The ART COLLECTION on
           display is indeed beautiful- photo-realist paintings -- and
           each one tells a strange story.
                         
           Robert enters and scans the room. No Julie. He approaches the
           gallery ASSISTANT.
                         
                          ROBERT
           How're they doing?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Great. Everyone loves them.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, but how are they doing?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           So-so.
                         
           He scans the party further. No Julie.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Where's Julie?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           She's in the back.
                         
                         
           INT. GALLERY - OFFICE IN BACK - CONTINUOUS
                         
           We pick up on Julie bumping two rails of COCAINE.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 21.
                         
          She's dressed in a burnt red, form-fitting Lanvin dress, hair
          coiffed, perfectly made-up-- if we didn't suspect anything,
          we'd think she was the precise image of New York art-world
          success.
                         
          Julie pulls her hair back and straightens, enters the main
          gallery...
                         
                         
          INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Where she quickly sees Robert searching for her through the
          crowd. She stops dead, considers going back into the office...
                         
          But she stands firm. Robert finds her eyes. He stares at her.
                         
          She stares back, with a simple look that says, plainly:
          "Go away."
                         
          She turns and heads off to talk to a group of PATRONS,
          including the painter VICTOR. One of the group is a DASHING
          YOUNG MAN- is he flirting with her?
                         
          Robert approaches, staring at the young man, then at Julie.
          She's all smiles, but she doesn't immediately introduce him.
          He stands there, until--
                         
                          ROBERT
           Hey, Julie.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh...
           (to the group)
           This is Robert Miller, one of our
           collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and
           Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava,
           who is a talented young artist.
                         
          Robert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries,
          especially kind to young AVA (15).
                         
                          ROBERT
           Oh, really? Painter?
                         
                          AVA
           Drawings.
                         
          Julie begins to walk off, disappearing into the crowd.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LOOKING AROUND)
           Yeah, that's great.
           (as he notices Julie
           leave, to the group)
                          (MORE)
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22.
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk
           to you about them in a second.
                         
          Robert trails Julie, moving up to her quickly. He reaches out
          to touch her and she spins towards him violent, definitive.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           What? Why are you doing this?
                         
                          JULIE
           Go -- away.
                         
          Julie heads back to the buyers.
                         
          Dismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out
          towards the entry desk.
                         
          He approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier
          and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I will take
                          (POINTING)
           those two. And the Rubik's cube on
           the back wall.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           (pointing to list)
           Right there, number seven.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Don't tell her it was me.
           (off her nod)
           I mean it.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           You got it.
                         
          Robert walks out and hails his driver.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER
                         
          Off Robert, in bed with Ellen who is asleep. He gets up and
          stumbles to the bathroom, puts on a robe.
                         
                         
          INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR
                         
          He approaches the basement level carrying a folder of
          papers...
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 23.
                         
          INT. SERVICE KITCHEN
                         
          And sits at the counter, staring at a REPORT of some kind. He
          refills a glass of SCOTCH, downs it.
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - NIGHT
                         
          Julie's a touch worn from the evening, but she's still
          composed. She sits with five guests including her gallery
          assistant, the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN from earlier, TWO WOMEN,
          and TWO GUYS who look like painters. One does a line of
          COCAINE off a "Fantom" magazine.
                         
                          PAINTER
           ...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van
           Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it
           a "State of Contemporism..."
                         
          Julie's phone RINGS. She looks at the Caller-ID, (which shows
          her home line calling) confused.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Who's this?
                         
           ROBERT (O.S.)
           It's me.
                         
                          JULIE
           What do you want?
                         
           ROBERT (O.S.)
           I'm here.
                         
                          JULIE
           Where?
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM
                         
          Robert watches Julie through a crack in the doorway. He's on
          her CORDLESS phone. We INTERCUT.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm in your bedroom. Can you get
           those people out of here?
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you serious?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Look down the hall. Do you see me?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (LOOKING)
           I see you.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Okay, so I'm serious.
                         
          She hangs up and begins to clear out the guests.
                         
          Robert sits, unbuttoning his collar.
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - LIVING ROOM
                         
          The guests finally leave. Julie heads to the bedroom...
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM
                         
          And finds Robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable.
                         
                          JULIE
           You just come in and out whenever
           you want?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I thought we should talk...
                         
                          JULIE
           (laughs, then in a rage)
           One damn night in a month I told
           you was important to me, et tu es
           meme pas capable d'etre la...
                         
                          ROBERT
           ...I was working, do you
           understand? I'm under enormous
           pressure, I have obligations...
                         
                          JULIE
           ...I don't want to hear about your
           obligations. If you cared -- YOU
           WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!
                         
                          ROBERT
           I was there! I was there! I was
           late, but I was there. And I'm
           here now.
                         
                          JULIE
           No, no, no. You're here when it's
           convenient for you to be here.
           C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means
           YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 25.
                         
          She walks off into the
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she
          downs a red wine.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          JULIE
           Why did you buy those paintings?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Because I liked them.
                         
          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and
          her anger.
                         
                          JULIE
           Okay, thank you for helping me get
           started. But if I'm gonna fail--
           then let me fail!
                         
                          ROBERT
           Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why
           would you fail?
                         
          He crosses towards her.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           You know, I'm not the kinda guy who
           wants to throw money away but if
           you wanna start a business, you
           have to project a certain image.
                         
                          JULIE
           What image?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Success.
                         
          He sits down next to her.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           The market's a disaster right now;
           nobody's moving anything. That's
           why you gotta show sales. People
           look at you then and they say
           "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and
           that's what they remember. Always.
                         
          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (QUIETLY)
           You're never gonna leave her.
                         
          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
                         BEDROOM
                         
          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.
                         
          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Come away with me. Let's just take
           your car and go...
                         
                          JULIE
           ...Where?...
                         
                          ROBERT
           There's a place upstate. Very
           beautiful, on the water. We can
           wake up there together- just you
           and me. I'd like that.
                         
          She's keeps crying, but...
                         
                          JULIE
           Me, too.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT
                         
          A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards
          Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More
          Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie
          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.
                         
          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled
          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into
          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's
          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off
          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...
                         
          A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY
                         
          Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where
          the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,
          flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.

          INT. CAR
                         
          Robert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly
          injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement
          returns...
                         
          He looks over at Julie.
                         
          It is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly
          decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck.
                         
          Shock, followed quickly by panic.
                         
          We hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak...
                         
          Robert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at
          the phone just before pressing "Send"... and hangs up.
                         
          He tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still
          rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP
          BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.
                         
          He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger
          side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to
          touch her, then stops.
                         
          Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in
          his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.
                         
          Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.

          Robert walks and walks through tall grass.
                         
          In the distance behind him, A MASSIVE EXPLOSION lights up the
          sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches, incinerating
          the car and its contents.

          Robert cleans himself up in the sink, applying soap and water
          to his cut stomach, scrubbing frantically, He takes all the
          paper towels and puts them in his pocket.

          Robert picks up a PAYPHONE by the bathrooms, cradling it to
          his ear with his sleeve and dialing with his other finger
          through his shirt fiber.

          EXT. CAR WRECKAGE SITE
                         
          POLICE CARS flash lights. An EMT unloads Julie's charred
          CORPSE into a BODY BAG. INVESTIGATORS sift through rubble.
                         
          DET. MICHAEL BRYER (43) sits in a TAN SEDAN, drinking a cup
          of deli coffee. Barely awake, he stares out the window at a
          bunch of STATE TROOPERS arguing with his partner, MILLS.
                         
          MILLS breaks away from the uniforms and approaches, shaking
          his head. Bryer gets out of the car.
                         
                          BRYER
           You gotta be fucking kidding me.
                         
                          MILLS
           Catching detective wants us to rule
           before he calls it.
                         
                          BRYER
           We've been having the same fuckin'
           argument for twenty years.

           I'm not so sure about this...
                         
          Bryer heads over to the car, his interest piqued.
                         
          Mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side.
                         
                          MILLS (CONT'D)

           were down there.
                         
          Bryer immediately sees what he means-- dented metal, even in
          the burnt door.
                         
                          BRYER
           ... So who kicked out the door?
                         
          Bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side,
          looking off into the distance of the path Robert took just
          moments before.

          About twenty yards down the road, a BLACK SUV hums, waiting.
          Robert opens the passenger door and gets in.

           Let's go.
                         
          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty
          banged up.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You gonna tell me what this is?
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's better you don't ask.
                         
                          JIMMY
           So all you're sayin' is, you need a
           ride somewhere.

          That's correct.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Because I want to be very clear
          about this: you called me to give
          you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.
                         
                          ROBERT
          No, you're not. We're not here.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?
                         
                          ROBERT
          We're both alseep right now. At

          Right.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Because if anyone checks...
                         
                          JIMMY
          Why is anyone gonna check?
                         
                          ROBERT
          They're not, as long as we're not here.
          Anybody know you're here?
                         
                          JIMMY
          No.
                         
                          ROBERT

                          ROBERT
          But somebody knows-- you're not there.
                         
                          JIMMY

           Good. So you're at home, and I'm at

           Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not
           myself. I need your help.
                         
          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.
                         
          Robert winces in pain.

           You alright?
                         
          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees
          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)

           No, I just... have to get home...
           I'll deal with it in a couple of
           hours.

          The SUV stops a few blocks from Robert's house.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (through the window)
           Call me, alright, and let me know
           it's okay.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (as he exits)
           Better we don't talk for a while.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (can't believe it--
           through the window)
           So what you get in a bind and just
           call up the only nigger you know?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 33.
                         
          Robert looks at Jimmy, eyes tearing.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just
           go home.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.
                         
          Jimmy's car drives off. Robert hobbles up the block.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - NIGHT
                         
          Robert enters the basement. He runs into a security
          monitoring room. We see a street view of cameras outside the
          door he just entered. He pulls DISCS out of VIDEO RECORDERS.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - SERVICE KITCHEN
                         
          Robert stands in front of a bin marked INCINERATOR. He is
          wearing a new T-SHIRT and SLACKS.
                         
          He places all of his bloodied clothes and the video discs
          into the incinerator, pouring LIGHTER FLUID on top of them.
          Staring at the clothes, he notices one cuff link is missing.
                         
          He strikes a match, setting the items on fire and closes the
          hopper.
                         
          As he exits the burning area--
                         
                          SERVANT
           Everything okay, sir?
                         
          Robert turns, startled.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed.
                         
          The servant shuffles off.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Robert quietly undresses, leaving on the white UNDERSHIRT. He
          presses at his rib, winces again. Then he gets into bed and
          stares at the ceiling.
                         
                          ELLEN

           Where did you go?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 34.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What?
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (DREAMY)
           I woke up for a minute, you weren't
           here...
                         
                          ROBERT
           I just went to... eat some ice cream.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Was it good?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (pained, shifting his body)
           Yes...
                         
                          ELLEN
           Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in
           the morning...
                         
                          ROBERT
           Ellen...
                         
                          ELLEN
           What?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Do you still love me?
                         
                          ELLEN
           Of course I do...
                         
          She rolls over. Hold on Robert's face.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY
                         
          SYD FELDER (64) sits next to Robert.
                         
                          SYD
           Hypothetically, the situation
           you're describing would be
           involuntary manslaughter.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And such a person...
                         
                          SYD
           ...would be in a lot of trouble,
           especially if that person was closing
           a merger with a large public bank
           where any publicity or arrest could
           delay or derail the transaction.

           But that's only if there was some
           evidence that could link him to
           the crime.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Fingerprints, DNA?
                         
                          SYD
           Very hard to collect after an explosion.
           The real world's different from television.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What about cell phone records?
                         
                          SYD
           Did this person make any calls from the area?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Not from a cell phone, no.
                         
                          SYD
           Then they won't be able to place him there.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What would you advise such a person
           to do?
                         
                          SYD
           To confess immediately.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Failing which?
                         
                          SYD
           To put as much distance between himself
           and the event as possible, if possible.
           But let me tell you something, and I'm
           speaking to you as a friend now: there
           are about fifty things that person
           wouldn't have thought of. And the more
           time that passes, the more lies that
           are told, the worse it gets for him.
                         
          Robert stands.

           Yeah.

                          SYD
           An accident's not the worst
           trouble. If we talk to them now we
           can probably work it out.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You tell me what happens if the
           Standard deal does not close, and I
           gotta tell my investors about our
           real losses?
                         
                          SYD
           Nothing good.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And what'd you say about the Justice
           Department? Depending on what they
           decide to arrest me on-- fraud
           conviction gets me twenty years?
                         
                          SYD
           I did.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (laughs in pain)
           What choice do I really have?

          We follow CHRIS VOGLER (52) through the busy lobby out to the
          street. He crosses Park Avenue and gets into Robert's limo.
                         
                         
          INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Robert opens the Percocet bottle, downs four PILLS.
                         
          Chris enters and sits. Robert mimes a question.

           You're aware Congress plans to

                          ROBERT
           Of course I am aware. I gave

           Well, Standard wants to prepare for
           it now. So I was asked to go through
           every one of your trading books and
           reconfirm their assets.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.
                         
                          CHRIS
           Don't worry. I put the team on
           different books and I left "Old

                          (SMILES)
           Anyway, I'm here to tell you-- I
           cleared it.

           Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're

                          ROBERT
           See her with anyone-- what do you

                          BRYER
           Reason I ask, is, that we haven't

          So no boyfriend that you know of?

          Actually we didn't talk about

                          BRYER
          She was just an employee, right?
                         
                          ROBERT
          Well not an employee. I was an investor.
                         
                          BRYER
          Why'd you invest?
                         
                          ROBERT
          Why did I invest?
                         
                          BRYER
          Yeah, why'd you invest?
                         
                          ROBERT
          She had a great eye. She found me
                          (POINTS)
          those Bryce Marden's there. They
          went up in value very quickly, and
          on the basis of that I agreed to
          fund some of the gallery.
                         
                          BRYER

                          ROBERT
          Why would I mind?
                         
                          BRYER
          It's in your company's name.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,
          go ahead.

                          BRYER
          Why would you lease an apartment
          for Ms. Côte? Is that something you
          normally do for your employees?
                         
                          ROBERT
          Actually I said that she wasn't an
          employee, but-- I think she'd just come
          over from Paris if I remember, and she
          needed a place to entertain buyers.
                         
                          BRYER
          So you leased her this apartment.
                         
                          ROBERT
          It was through our holding company.
          You seem a little confused by all
          this...
                         
                          BRYER
                          (LAUGHS)
          I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Alright.
                         
                          BRYER
          Now, I don't mean to be
          indelicate...
                         
                          ROBERT
          But you're going to be
          indelicate...
                         
                          BRYER
          Well, from what I've been able to
          gather, she wasn't exactly an art
          star. I mean, she worked for a
          couple a dealers in Paris, but...
                         
                          ROBERT
          Oh, okay, I get it, so why would
          I invest in her and help her find
          a place?
                         
                          BRYER
          Something like that, yeah.
                         
                          ROBERT
          It's very simple, detective. I invest
          in people I believe in. I thought
          she'd do well, so I backed her, she

           And it's a wrong number.
                         
          Jimmy doesn't answer.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Why do you accept the charges on a
           collect call from a wrong number?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I don't think I wanna answer any
           more questions.
                         
                          BRYER
           And you stay on the phone a minute and
           a half on a wrong number? What the
           fuck do you talk about, area codes?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I want to talk to my lawyer.
                         
                          MILLS
           Listen, kid, we know you went out
           there. We ID'd your photo with your
           neighbor who saw you getting into
           your truck ten minutes after this
           call was made.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Well if you got all that, what the
           fuck you need me for, officer?
                         
                          BRYER
           I don't think you understand the
           gravity of the situation here,
           Jimmy. This is a homicide.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Lawyer.
                         
                         
          INT. SYD'S LIMO - DAY
                         
          Robert rides with Syd. He reviews a DOCUMENT entitled
          "MAPLE LANE TRUST - James L. Grant - Beneficiary."
                         
          Robert signs the document, closing the folder.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 52.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're gonna sign him out?
                         
                          SYD
           I called in Earl Monroe.
                         
                          ROBERT
           The basketball player?
                         
                          SYD
           Civil rights attorney. You remember
           Crown Heights?
                         
                          ROBERT
           He's the best?
                         
                          SYD
           He's the best above 96th Street- and
           that doesn't make him any cheaper.
                         
          Robert slumps back, staring out the window.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.
                         
                          SYD
           It might not be that easy. If he
           doesn't cooperate they're likely to
           indict him on obstruction.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What would he be looking at?
                         
                          SYD
           Hard to say. With his prior... Five
           years, maybe ten.
                         
          Robert's silent.
                         
                         
          INT. BOND RELEASE AREA - DAY
                         
          Jimmy stands at the counter as EARL MONROE (50s, Black) signs
          papers. Bryer waits.
                         
                          BRYER
                          (TO JIMMY)
           This is not going to go away.
                         
          Jimmy ignores him and exits with Earl.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jimmy and Earl exit the buidling.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 53.
                         
                          EARL
           I'll call you tomorrow if there's any
           news. Don't worry about anything. And
           don't talk to anyone else. You take care.
                         
          Jimmy nods and walks up the street towards Syd's limo in the
          distance.

           Come on, get in.
                         
          Jimmy enters. The limo drives off.
                         
                          JIMMY
           All you said was you wanted a
           fucking ride! You didn't tell me
           you killed that girl!
                         
                          ROBERT
           Jimmy...
                         
                          JIMMY
           I'm trying to put my life back
           together. Okay, I appreciate you
           helped us, but now you're pushing
           it too far.
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's gonna be okay.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Like it was your ass sitting in
           there? Like you know a fucking
           thing about how it's gonna be?
                         
                          ROBERT
           We've got you the best criminal lawyer--
                         
                          JIMMY
           --Don't you got your own son for this?
           Why the hell you didn't call him?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin'
           idiot, but that ain't my fault.

                          JIMMY
           Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd,
           what happens now?
                         
                          SYD
           We meet with Earl and we go from
           there. I understand that right now
           they don't have enough to charge
           you with anything.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Your under suspicion.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!
                         
                          ROBERT
           I am aware of that.
                         
                          JIMMY
           And what exactly would you like me
           to do about it?
                         
                          SYD
           (BUZZING the driver)
           Gentlemen, my driver will take you
           where you wanna go, but I cannot be
           a party to this conversation, so
           this is where I get out...
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET
                         
          Syd steps out of the limo and watches as it rolls away up
          Tenth Avenue.

                          JIMMY
           Why couldn't you have just stayed?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I couldn't.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Why not?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Because I have responsibilities.
           And if I stayed there, a lot of
           people would've been hurt.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Somebody was hurt.

                          ROBERT
           Other people, Jimmy. I've got business
           troubles, you understand...? People
           rely on me.
                         
          Jimmy chews on this, dissatisfied.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Listen... I want to talk to you a second.
           Come here. I wanna show you something.
                         
          Jimmy slides over to sit next to Robert.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, you know, your father asked me
           to look after you.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yeah.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, I know I messed up, alright?
           I'm sorry. But I do want to help
           you, you know that.
           (handing Jimmy the folder)
           So I've been able to set up a
           situation for you.
                         
                          JIMMY
           What's that?
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's a trust. In your name, assets
           of $2 Million dollars. Take a look
           at that.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (ASTOUNDED)
           Are you serious? You think money's
           gonna fix this?
                         
                          ROBERT
           What else is there?
                         
          Jimmy laughs, then rises and knocks on the limo's partition.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (to the driver)
           Yo, yo man, pull over.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (stares at him)
           What are you gonna do?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56.
                         
                          JIMMY
           I look like a fucking snitch to you?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know.
           Are you?
                         
          Jimmy laughs in disgust, begins to open the door.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just--
           read it. Just take it home and read
           it. It's not gonna hurt you.
                         
          Jimmy grabs the document and gets out. Robert stares ahead
          into space. His CELLPHONE RINGS.

           accounting, you asked me to

                          ROBERT
           Yeah, put him through...

           Chris...
                         
           CHRIS (O.S.)
           Robert, I've run into some problems.
           We're doing a "non-recommend."

                          (BEWILDERED)
           What...?
                         
           CHRIS (O.S.)
           They got compliance involved. I'm sorry.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Chris...
                         
           CHRIS (O.S.)
           I've gotta go.

          Brooke sits alone in the accountant's office we saw earlier.
          She reviews SPREADSHEETS on his COMPUTER and compares them
          with PRINTOUTS from a FILE CABINET that she has broken open.
                         
          Numbers from the screen reflect across her reading glasses as
          she stares in disbelief. She DIALS a number.

          Robert stands there a moment, staring at her.
                         
                         
          EXT. 5TH AVENUE - AFTERNOON
                         
          We see Brooke and Robert from overhead like little dots as
          they cross 5th Avenue towards Central Park.
                         
                         
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake.
          Robert sits, motions to Brooke.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You wanna sit?

           I'll stand.

                          ROBERT
          I made a bad bet.
                         
                          BROOKE
          No, you committed fraud.

                          ROBERT
          Because we were going broke!
          Everything was finished. We'd have
          nothing.

                          ROBERT
          You remember Alexanderov? Well he
          came to see me one day last year.
          He said "Robert, we've got a great
          opportunity- there's a copper mine,
          it's in Russia, it's under-
          exploited- there's billions under
          the ground, and to get it out, all
          we need is a couple hundred
          million, you put in a hundred,
          we'll put in a hundred- we'll
          triple it all in six months." So, I
          go check it out. And the geological
          survey's right, friendly
          government. And to lock it in, you
          hedge it, right? Sell the copper
          ahead on the commodities exchange
          and it all works, it's fine, and
          you're making a fortune.

          But then there's something I hadn't
          accounted for-- variation margin--
          and that friendly Russian
          government all of a sudden not so
          friendly anymore and they're
          blocking the export of the copper
          so I gotta make it up, I gotta put
          the cash in to cover the hedge. But
          I'm not worried about it because
          it's still springing money, there's
          so much money coming out of the
          ground you can't believe. You can't
          stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle,

          Nobody's getting arrested. That's why
          I borrowed the money from Jeffrey.
          Plug the hole, I put it there for a
          month, they see the books are fine, I
          transfer the company, I pay back
          Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all
          of our investors whole, and what's
          left we keep. At least we get to keep
          the house.

           `Cause you're disposable- you're
           the one person he could call that
           just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're
           a- you're a throwaway. You're just
           another part of his transaction.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (tries to open the locked door)
           Will you open the door?
                         
                          BRYER
           So what, what? You're his new
           nigger now?
                         
          Jimmy grabs at the door violently. It's locked.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Open-- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
                         
                          BRYER
           You didn't kill that girl. He did.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (containing his rage)
           Will you -- open -- the door?
                         
                          BRYER
           He's using you. I know it - you
           know it. Do the right thing. Now
           get outta my fuckin' car.
                         
          Bryer unlocks the door. Jimmy exits and walks up the block.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at
          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.
                         
                          SYD
           He's gonna walk.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're certain?
                         
                          SYD
           Courts aren't for certainty, but he
           says he was at home, why shouldn't
           he be? A phone call doesn't make
           him a liar.
           (off Robert's nod)
           But what's baffling to me, though,
           despite your sentimental history
           together, is why you would put your
           family's future in this kid's hands.

           Is that a good thing?

           I don't know.
                         
          Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE.

                          ROBERT
           She's good. Fine.
           (stops packing, looks up)
           Why?
                         
                          SYD
           I heard something...
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yes...?
                         
                          SYD
           She met with Gil Deuchman.
                         
                          ROBERT
           The estate lawyer?
                         
                          SYD
           Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Not to me.
                         
          They sit in silence.
                         
                         
          INT. CRIMINAL COURT - FELONY INDICTMENTS - THE NEXT DAY
                         
          We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The
          prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next
          to Jimmy.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           That was the early morning of April 11th.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.

                          DEFERLITO
           You received a phone call?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Who called you?
                         
          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.
                         
                          JIMMY
           It was a wrong number.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           You stayed on the phone one-and-a-
           half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it
           the case that you know exactly who
           called you and exactly why? Why are
           you lying to this court?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I'm not lying.
                         
          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He
          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           I'm going to introduce into evidence
           People's A. This is a toll booth
           photograph taken in the northbound ninth
           lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,
           directing your attention to the
           photograph, would you please read the
           date and time stamp indicated on the
           lower right hand corner?
                         
          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.
                         
                          JIMMY
           This is crazy.
                         
                          EARL
           (whispers in Jimmy's ear)
           You're gonna have to answer that.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Mr. Grant, please answer the question.

                          DEFERLITO
           Mr. Grant, directing your attention
           to the same photograph, would you
           please read the license plate
           number of the vehicle passing
           through the toll?
                         
                          JIMMY
           D D G five five four two.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           (handing in another sheet)
           This is People's B, a printout from
           the Department of Motor Vehicles
           plate registry... Mr. Grant,
           directing your attention to that
           printout, are those numbers on the
           toll photograph the same ones that
           are on your own license plate?
                         
          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.
                         
                          DEFERLITO (CONT'D)
           Mr. Grant?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Yes, the numbers are the same?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           How do you explain that?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I can't.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           But that is your car in this
           photograph, isn't it?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           No, that is not your car?
           (off his silence)
           Answer the question, Mr. Grant.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 74.
                         
                          JIMMY
           This is not my car in this picture.
           I don't know how you all did that,
           but this is not my car.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           You expect this grand jury to
           believe that that is not your car
           when there is a printout from the
           department of motor vehicles...
                         
                          EARL
           That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're
           not permitted to go on record.
                         
                         
          INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER
                         
          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.
                         
                          EARL
           Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?
                         
                          JIMMY
           They're lying!
                         
                          EARL
           Okay, now here's what...
                         
          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over
          to them.
                         
                          BRYER
           I can halt the decision.
                         
                          EARL
           We need a minute, Detective.
                         
                          BRYER
           What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?
                         
          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Cause if you do we could...
                         
                          JIMMY
           You can get the fuck outta my face.
           How `bout that?.

                          BRYER
           So you wanna keep playing games? Or
           you ready to tell me something?
                         
                          EARL
           Detective, I need to talk to my client.
           Now if you would just please...
                         
                          JIMMY
           How you- How you all just gonna lie
           like that? Huh? How you all just
           gonna lie?!
                         
                          BRYER
           We didn't lie. You lied.
                         
                          JIMMY
           That wasn't my car.
                         
                          EARL
           ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.
                         
                          BRYER
           Sure it wasn't. And it was a
           telemarketer called you from the pay
           phone? He stopped at the Chevron to
           make a late night sale?
                         
                          JIMMY
           That picture was some bullshit...
                         
                          EARL
           ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's
           going on?
                         
                          BRYER
           Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.
           Tell him. See how the boss'll like
           this one.
                         
          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Last chance.
                         
          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.
                         
                          EARL
           (rising, to Jimmy)
           Wait here.
                         
          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.
                         
                         CLOSE ON:

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards
          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.
                         
                         
          INT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY
                         
          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front
          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.
                         
          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art
          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at
          him quietly, then quickly looks away.
                         
          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to
          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and
          holds a moment at the casket.
                         
          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce
           you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.
                         
          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert
          approaches as she stands.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I am so, so sorry.
                         
                          SANDRINE
           (nods, then)
           I just wanted to thank you for what
           you did for my daughter.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (shaking his head softly)
           No...
                         
                          SANDRINE
           You believed in her, and you gave
           her a chance. She was happy. I know
           she was happy.
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's just...
                          (EMOTIONAL)
           not fair, is it?
                         
          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           This shouldn't have happened.
                         
          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          Close on Brooke's legs, running on a treadmill. Ellen
          exercises on a STAIRMASTER next to her. We hear the sound of
          Ellen's small talk begin to fade in.
                         
                          ELLEN
           ...she's rail thin. She's a blond.
           I would not have known who she was
           if she hadn't come up and
           introduced herself to me. She
           looked totally different... and...
           (notices Brooke increasing
           the machine's resistance)
           You're going straight to level six
           don't you think you better pace
           yourself a little bit?

                          ELLEN
           Everything okay with you and Tom?

           Are you worried about the deal closing?

                          ELLEN
           You want me to guess?
                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Brookie, come on, don't be silly,
           tell me what's...
                         
          Brooke stabs "Stop" on the machine, quickly cooling down.

           Why not?

           We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
                         
                          BROOKE
           I'm not lying to you. It's
           complicated; you wouldn't understand.
                         
          Ellen crosses closer to Brooke blocking her exit.
                         
                          ELLEN

           Uh, I know that a policeman showed
           up at the office? Do you know what
           that's about?

           I honestly have no idea.
                         
                          ELLEN
           What about your father's head-
           where he cut his head and the pain
           that he's hiding in his stomach
           and, now
           (starts to tear)
           For some reason that's way to
           complicated for me to understand,
           there's no money for a routine
           gift? Does that seem a little
           strange to you?
                         
                          BROOKE
           Of course it's strange.

                          ELLEN
           No. You have to do what's right for
           you. Not him, not me, not anyone.
           This is your life.
                         
          Ellen grabs Brooke and hugs her hard. Brooke hugs back,
          kissing her mother on the cheek, tearing.

          JAMES MAYFIELD (50s) waits alone at a table. Robert enters.
          They shake hands, then sit.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You keep sending people to my

                          MAYFIELD
           They're just getting acquainted.

                          MAYFIELD
           You remember what it was like on
           our side of the fence. Everything
           just moves... a little slower. Plus
           this whole audit mess doesn't help.
           You know, clearing that all up...

          No, no, no. Forget it, forget it...
          Forget the deal. I don't even care
          about the deal. No, I run a

          else you never would've called me in

           One other thing -- six months and I'm

           No, no. He doesn't have to do
           anything, he just gets the salary,
           he gets the office. Both of `em on

           I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it.
                         
          Mayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu.
          Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           I'll send over a draft of the press release.
                         
          As Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib.
                         
                          MAYFIELD (CONT'D)
           Are you all right?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm fine... Before I go -- how much
           would you have paid...?
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Six hundred. And you would've taken...?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Four seventy-five.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           So we made a good deal.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (as he heads away)
           Yeah.
                         
          Robert turns back to the table.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Actually, I lied. I would've taken four.
                         
          Mayfield shrugs and returns to his paper. Robert walks out of
          the restaurant, beaming.

          INT. MILLER CAPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
                         
          Peter, Gavin, and many of the various STAFF we have met are
          gathered around a long conference table. Robert stands at the
          front of the room.
                         
                          ROBERT
           ...Anyway I will be seeing most of
           you at the gala tomorrow night. But
           as the sale's official as of this
           afternoon, you are now free to talk
           about it. Any questions?
                         
                          PETER
                          (JOVIAL)
           Will we get new business cards?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (NODS)
           Yes, everyone but you.
                          (HEADING OUT)
           Alright, it's a great day. Your
           hard work made it happen
                         
          They all clap as Gavin and Robert exit the room.
                         
                          GAVIN
                          (SOTTO)
           So how'd you make Mayfield come around?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I met his price. I just took it out of
           your share.
                         
                          GAVIN
           Robert?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah.
                         
                          GAVIN
           Good work.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Well, thank you. Now go get me that
           fucking hospital check.
                         
          Gavin walks off. Robert's cell RINGS.

          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK
                         
          Robert heads through a dark service entrance towards a
          buzzer, then down a long hallway.
                         
                          ROBERT (PRE-LAP)
           Hello.
                         
                         
          INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT
                         
          Reina, Jimmy's girlfriend (24, Hispanic) stands at the door
          with Robert and Jimmy. She turns and heads to the bedroom.
                         
          Jimmy heads to the kitchen.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You want something to drink?
                         
                          ROBERT
           What you got?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Not much.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You got any milk?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'll take a water.
                         
          Jimmy starts running the tap. Robert notices the moving BOXES.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Where are you going?
                         
                          JIMMY
           What?
                         
                          ROBERT
           The boxes.
                         
                          JIMMY
           I was planning on Virginia, but it
           looks like I'm not going anymore.
                         
          Jimmy returns with the water. Robert take a drink.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
           You waiting for me to say something?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 85.
                         
                          ROBERT
          I told you not to take the toll.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Yes, you did.
                         
                          ROBERT
          I said "Listen to what I have to
          tell you and follow my directions,
          listen to me closely, do the
          following just like I say."
                         
                          JIMMY
          Yes. You said all that.
                         
                          ROBERT
          But you took the toll anyway.
                         
                          JIMMY
          No, I did not.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie
          to me...
                         
                          JIMMY
          I'm not lying! I took ninety-five all
          the Goddamn way there. I did what you
          said: I didn't stop. I didn't take
          the Triborough. I followed all your
          fucking instructions.
                         
                          ROBERT
          So where'd they get the photograph from?
                         
                          JIMMY
          You tell me.
                         
                          ROBERT
          So, you're saying... it's a fake?
                         
                          JIMMY
          How'd you get so fuckin' rich again?
                         
                          ROBERT
          Don't be such a wiseass...
                         
                          JIMMY
          Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man!
          Earl's telling me it could be ten
          years? Ten fucking years! How much
          are ten years worth, Robert?
           (off his silence)
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
          Look man, I told you, I ain't no fuckin
          snitch, but this is bad. This is real
          bad. Reina and I got a whole plan we're
          about to make happen next week!
                         
                          ROBERT
           (as Jimmy sits)
          What plan?
                         
                          JIMMY
          I got money saved up; I'm buying a business.
                         
                          ROBERT
          What business?
                         
                          JIMMY
          I bought an Applebee's.
                         
                          ROBERT
          What's an Applebee's?
                         
                          JIMMY
          It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's
          a chain restaurant.
                         
                          ROBERT
          You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?
                         
                          JIMMY
          Is this really what you came here to
          talk about? What are you gonna do?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SITS)
          It's not really that simple, Jimmy.
          I'm in a situation now.
                         
                          JIMMY
          What situation?
                         
                          ROBERT
          I told you... right now, if I were to
          speak, a lot of people would get hurt.
          Jobs, families. A lot of innocent
          people. Do you think you can
          understand that?
                         
                          JIMMY
          Yeah but what about me? What about my
          situation?
           (off his silence)
          They showed me pictures, man;
          that's fucked up what you did.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SOTTO)
           It was an accident.
                         
                          JIMMY
           And yeah, I know, all the people
           counting on you, whatever, but --
           you told me Earl was gonna make
           this right. Now you know I care
           about you, all the things you did
           for us, and for my father, but Earl
           said they're offering me a deal, no
           charges at all. I walk away. They
           just want to know who I went to
           pick up.
                          (BEAT)
           Why are you putting me in this
           position, man? Why are you putting
           me in this situation?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LEANS FORWARD)
           Can you just hang tight? Just a
           little longer?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's
           on the table for twenty-four hours.
           After that, they're filing the case,
           and Earl says we're gonna lose.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (nods, stands)
           Alright I hear you. I'll be back
           with you as soon as I can. Just
           hang with me a little bit.
                         
          Jimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the
          living room as he approaches the door and exits.
                         
                          REINA
           You gotta give him up.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You said take the money.
                         
                          REINA
           That was to keep quiet, not to go away.
                          (BEAT)
           What's he offering you now?
                         
                          JIMMY
           What can he offer me?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88.
                         
          Reina crosses to Jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry, then
          wipes away his tears.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - NIGHT
                         
          The limo drives down Fifth Avenue. Robert's on the phone.
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           We went to the toll authority. They
           said they gave the tape to the cops.
           I've requested our investigator go
           examine it at the evidence room, but
           honestly what's the point?
                         
                          ROBERT
           He says he didn't take the toll.
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           And you believe him?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (after a beat)
           Does Standard have clawback?
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           What? What do you mean?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Let's just say I decide to go in...
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           Have you lost your mind?
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, just listen, listen to me. If I
           were to surrender, now, could they roll
           back the deal?
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           (after a beat)
           No, what's done is done. There's no
           intent to defraud. You haven't warranted
           any behavior. So it's just money.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Four years, you think?
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           At this point- I dunno, they're not
           gonna make it easy.... I really suggest
           you think about this.

           Call the DA, get it started.
                         
          Robert hangs up. He stares out the window at Central Park.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - NIGHT
                         
          He enters the foyer and ascends the steps to his bedroom.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          No Ellen. He looks at his watch: "8:34PM."
                         
          He moves over towards the bed and dials the tableside PHONE.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where
           she was going tonight...? Aha... No,
           I'm sure... I'll try her cell.
                         
          He clicks off and DIALS another number, hears Ellen's voice
          mail come on the line, and hangs up.
                         
          He exhales and lies down on the bed in his clothes, staring
          at the ceiling. He lies motionless a moment.
                         
          And then he sits up, thinks, and shakes his head.
                         
          He quickly picks up the phone, stabbing at the keys.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call
           to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no,
           no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell
           him to get his car, tell him to meet
           us at my house in twenty minutes...
           And, Syd...? Bring a notary.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE - NIGHT
                         
          A steady stream of CARS passes through the toll. We follow a
          BLUE LEXUS as it approaches the far right lane.
                         
                         
          INT. LEXUS - SAME
                         
          Earl Monroe pays the TOLL CLERK through the window, getting a
          RECEIPT. Then he pulls his car to the side of the road, parking
          at a BUILDING labelled "Port Authority - Administration."
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 90.
                         
           He opens a LAPTOP on the passenger seat, typing numbers from
           the toll receipt into a little box on the screen. A portable
           PRINTER spits out pages. Earl stamps them with a NOTARY.
                         
                         
           INT. TOLL AUTHORITY - NIGHT
                         
           Earl waits at the front desk of the drab government office.
           BRENT, a balding man in his 30's, approaches.
                         
                          BRENT
           Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night
           supervisor. How can I help you?
                         
                          EARL
           (handing him some papers)
           Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm
           executing a criminal evidence request.
           I need to get a look at one of your
           lane tapes.
                         
           Brent looks over the papers, confused.
                         
                          BRENT
           I don't understand. This says you
           want to look at a tape made ten
           minutes ago...?
                         
                         
           INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS
                         
           Robert and Syd stare ahead, silently. Syd tries to say something.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (holding up his hand)
           Wait. Wait. Just wait.
                         
          121 Syd slumps back. They keep staring at nothing. 121
                         
           A RAPPING noise on the window startles Syd, who rolls it
           down, sees Earl, and opens the door.
                         
           Earl climbs inside, removing a FOLIO from his breast pocket
           as he talks.
                         
                          EARL
           Okay, they won't release tapes
           without a court order, but they did
           give me a print out, the same kind
           they used at Jimmy's indictment.
                         
           Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the PHOTOGRAPH he
           got from the toll authority. He lays it on the counter.
                         
           It's from a toll camera, showing his car and license plate.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 91.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (TO EARL)
           The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?
                         
          Earl nods.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (TO SYD)
           You got Jimmy's?
                         
          Syd lays the PHOTOGRAPH we saw earlier of Jimmy's car going
          through the toll onto the counter next to the one Earl has
          just placed there.
                         
          Robert picks up a high-end MAGNIFYING GLASS and leans over to
          look at the two photos.
                         
                         CLOSE-UP:
                         
          He scans the photograph of Earl's car, moving slowly
          through it left-to-right.
                         
          Then he scans the photograph of Jimmy's car, passing left-to-
          right until --
                         
          He passes back by the license plate area and stops --
                         
          The lines around the license plate of Jimmy's car are all
          slightly-pixelated.
                         
          He switches back to the plate on Earl's car. The lines are
          fine. Back to Jimmy's. Pixelated.
                         
          Robert puts down the magnifier, straightens, and smiles.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Son of a bitch.
                         
          Earl's dark laugh cackles across the soundtrack as we
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY
                         
          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE
          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Well they look a little different to me,
           too... Is there a reason you haven't
           allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to
           conduct his own analysis?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           We've had some issues regarding
           chain-of-custody...
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           ...You don't have them anymore.
           You're to meet him with the evidence
           in the next hour.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           I'm afraid that's not possible.
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Where's the tape?
                          (ANOTHER BEAT)
           Am I not speaking loud enough?
                         
                          BRYER
           Your honor...
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Yes?
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           It seems there's been...
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           ...Let him tell me.
                         
                          BRYER
           We don't know where it is.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Come again?
                         
                          BRYER
           It's not in the evidence locker.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Where is it?
                         
                          BRYER
           We don't know.
                         
          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           I'll ask you one last time,
           detective. Where is the tape?
                         
                          BRYER
           (after a beat)
           We lost it.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Hmmm... In light of these
           developments, and I would think you
           should be very happy to hear this,
           with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going
           to offer Mr. Deferlito the
           opportunity to voluntarily dismiss
           the indictment to save us all a
           bunch of embarrassment.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           I don't feel comfortable with that,
           your honor.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Further I'm going to put all charges
           against Mr. Grant under seal.
           (Bryer starts heading to
                          THE DOOR)
           This case is dismissed with prejudice
           and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,
           Detective.
           (Bryer stops.)
           If you have another suspect in the
           automobile death then you are to present
           him, but Mr. Grant is free from any
           further inquiry in this matter. This is
           over. Do I have your understanding?
                         
                          EARL
           Thank you.
                         
          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Close the door, detective,
           please...
                         
          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.
                         
                          RITTENBAND (CONT'D)

           You finessed these, didn't you...?
                         
                          BRYER
           I'm sorry?
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           ...You finessed it. I know it, and
           you know it.
                         
          No response.

                          RITTENBAND (CONT'D)
           I know who you're after. I saw all the
           evidence, not just the toll photo. You
           gotta get him the right way.
                         
                          BRYER
           Oh, okay.
           (approaches the judge)
           So let me get this straight: What
           you're telling me is I'm supposed to
           sit around with my thumb up my ass
           and my fingers crossed hoping that
           one of these fucking days, somewhere
           down the line, one of these rich
           assholes is gonna say the wrong thing
           LOUD enough so that we can't choose
           to ignore it anymore?
                         
                          RITTENBAND
                          (BEAT)
           Get the fuck outta of my office.
                         
                          BRYER
           Yes, your honor.
                         
                         
          INT. COURTHOUSE HALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Mills waits on a nearby bench, watching as Bryer exits the
          chambers dialing his phone. DeFerlito walks up to Bryer, and
          grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.
          Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.
                         
                          BRYER
           (on the phone)
           Well when do you expect her...? When
           do you expect her? Okay, well so I
           don't have to call a ninth time, will
           you take down what I'm sayin', word
           for word...? Okay, you got a pencil?
           You ready? Okay, here goes: "Mrs.
           Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do
           you really think I am?"

          Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You didn't hurt anybody. You helped
           a lot of people.

                          JIMMY
           And this piece of paper makes
           everything okay?
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, it makes it easier.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (BEAT)
           You worried I'm gonna say something?
                         
                          ROBERT
           No.
                         
          Jimmy keeps staring at the document.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Robert, look: you asked me to come
           meet you and I'm here, but I came
           because I wanted to get something
           straight between us: we're even.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Okay, we're even. But just for the
           record though, what you did...
           (picks up the trust document)
           Was way beyond the money.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (LAUGHS)
           Nothing's beyond money for you.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LAUGHS BACK)
           Thanks a lot.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (pointing to the document)
           And if I take this, then what does
           that say about me?
                         
          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in
          his pocket.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
           Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money
           and do something good with it.
                         
          Hold on Jimmy.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa
          finishing a drink.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 96.
                         
          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna
           get there...? I don't wanna get
           there too soon...
                         
          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           (tying his tie)
           You okay? What is it?
                         
                          ELLEN
           You spoke to Brooke?
                         
          He slows... Something's brewing.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Did she tell you that?
                         
                          ELLEN
           No. She didn't have to.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...
                         
                          ELLEN
           ...you explained, did you?
                          (A BEAT)
           Did you tell her everything?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yes.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Everything?
           (off his silence)
           Lift up your shirt.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What?
                         
                          ELLEN
           Lift up -- your shirt.
                         
          He doesn't move.
                         
          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a
          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.
                         
          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.
                         
          It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 97.
                         
                          ELLEN (CONT'D)
          Did you tell her about that?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LONG BEAT)
          Ellen I don't know what you think
          you know...
                         
                          ELLEN
          Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.
          You've been sneaking off to see her for
          months. You don't think I know that?
                         
                          ROBERT
          What do you think you know?
                         
                          ELLEN
          I never cared, really, about your
          secretaries, your- gallerists,
          whores, whatever you wanna call them.
          I cared about our home. And now you
          have brought this to our door.
                         
                          ROBERT
          I did what was necessary.
                         
                          ELLEN
          No you did what was necessary for
          you, Robert, for your interests.
                         
                          ROBERT
          For my interests?
                         
                          ELLEN
          Yes.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Everything I do is for us, for this
          family, and now you're gonna tell
          me how to run my business.
                         
                          ELLEN
          This isn't about your business,
          this is our life! Where do you
          think we're going tonight? Why do
          you think I've even tolerated this
          for so long?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (he's had enough)
          What you've tolerated? Wow!
                         
                          ELLEN
          I'm glad you find that funny.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What about me? What about the
           complaints? The unhappiness? The
           drinking? The shopping? The
           trainers? Everything! But yes, the
           charities, the wonderful sainted
           charities, you know, all the
           wonderful works that you do. How do
           you think I've paid for them?
                         
                          ELLEN
           I didn't ask you because I didn't
           want you to lie.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (WALKS OFF)
           It's cause you didn't want to give
           `em up!
                         
                          ELLEN
           But I thought that we had an
           understanding. And you broke that
           understanding when you brought
           Brooke into it.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, I kept her out.
                         
                          ELLEN
           When you made Brooke complicit-- when
           you risked her future-- and I'm done.
                         
          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides
          them toward him.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What is this?
                         
                          ELLEN
           Read it.
                         
          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the
          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a
          few brief seconds until...
                         
                          ROBERT
           "All ownership and voting rights
           transfer to the Miller Charitable
           Foundation, to be administered by
           Brooke Miller?" Did you really
           expect me to sign this thing?
                         
                          ELLEN
           You're not following.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 99.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Apparently not, no. No.
                         
                          ELLEN
           (like talking to a child)
           Okay, uhm, the police have been
           trying to talk me. I assume they
           want to know where you were that
           night. And you know what? I'm not
           gonna lie for you anymore. Not
           unless you sign that.
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.
                         
                          ELLEN
           I think you'll find a way to
           manage. I'm sure you have all kinds
           of things offshore for a rainy day.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           This is fuckin' crazy.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (FAST)
           No, if you sign, then I'll tell your
           lie. I'll say you were at home with
           me that night, all night, together,
           here, and you'll be free and clear.
           And the people who need our money
           will get it. That's my price.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're out of your mind. I am not
           signing that. I will not sign that!
                         
                          ELLEN
           Well then... I'll have to tell them
           that you came home at four-thirty
           bruised and bleeding...
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's fucking ridiculous! What...
           (crosses close to her)
           Are you trying to blackmail me?
                         
                          ELLEN
           I think we call it negotiating.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 100.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're not gonna win that one.
           There's no fucking way.
                         
                          ELLEN
           You know what, it'll cause just
           enough trouble- the kind of trouble
           that you don't want-- In fact,
           according to my lawyer
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (PACES)
           Fucking lawyer...
                         
                          ELLEN
           It's enough to give them probable
           cause and then they can subpoena
           your cell phone, GPS, DNA,
                         
                          ROBERT
           Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!
                         
                          ELLEN
           And whatever else they can think of.
           So really Robert what you have is a
           choice: you can spend the next three
           years in court and in the tabloids
           or-- you can be at your business.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           You won't do it. You won't do this.
           You won't do it to the kids.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Just try me.
                         
          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.
                         
                          ELLEN (CONT'D)
                          (FINALLY CRIES)
           You broke -- our little girl's heart.
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's how it all works, Ellen. You
           know that.
                         
                          ELLEN

          INT. MAYFIELD'S LIMO - NIGHT
                         
          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of
          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN
          AIMES, sits nearby.
                         
                          AIMES
           There's just one more thing... And
           I hate to mention it now, but I
           just received it...
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Speak, John.
                         
          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.
                         
                          AIMES
           I had Stern Marling run a secondary
           audit on the Miller financials.
                         
          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:
                         
          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have
          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to
          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412
          Million..."
                         
          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the
          spreading realization.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Who authorized this?
                         
                          AIMES
           I did.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           (after a beat)
           And what did you conclude?
                         
                          AIMES
           It's in front of you.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
                          (LAUGHS)
           I didn't ask you what the paper said,
           John. I asked you what you thought.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 102.
                         
                          AIMES
           (after a beat, carefully)
           Well... what do you think?
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           I think... I think... that I don't
           see anything wrong here.
                         
          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his
          papers. Aimes nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. PLAZA HOTEL
                         
          They arrive at the Plaza Hotel and exit the car
                         
                         
          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
                         
          We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to
          the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:
          "Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."
                         
                         
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER
                         
          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,
          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.
          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.
                         
          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the
          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the
          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.
                         
                          BROOKE
           ...and to receive this prestigious
           award, I invite now to the stage
           the man who led this generous
           effort, and whose financial trading
           firm, Miller Capital, has just this
           morning been acquired by Standard
           Bank and Trust, a dedicated
           businessman, family man, scholar,
           philanthropist and all-around
           humanitarian, a man I am lucky to
           call -- my mentor, my friend -- and
           my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...
                         
          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way
          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,
          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.

          After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.
          It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.

          1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1

          Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
          chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika! Fists in the
          air.

          SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
          YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
          with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
          chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
          Ayatollah Khomeini.
          PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
          were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
          Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH -- JUSTICE
          FOR MURDER. A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
          bystanders than peacekeepers.
          A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
          An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.

          2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2

          From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

          3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3

          Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
          Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

          MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the
          window.

          4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4

          Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
          simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
          and makes it to the other side.
          And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
          isn't archive footage anymore.
          We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA
          station chief here.

          5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5

          From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY
          SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors
          break across the lawn.

          MARINE SGT. SICKMANN
          (into his radio)
          ... Fort Apache is breached -- 
          please advise --

          6 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 6

          The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier --
          its energy and numbers swelling.
          A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
          bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
          the front of the protest --
          WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
          As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
          WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
          underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT
          -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate

                         CLOSED --
          When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket
          raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed
          PISTOL in his clothes.
          More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
          to the other side, one after another.

          THEY'RE COMING OVER THE WALLS --

          8 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 8

          But a moment later no more climbing is required, because
          the GATE CHAIN IS CUT and protestors FLOOD through the
          embassy gates, a human dam breaking --

          9 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 9

          Mounting chaos in here, the nerve center of the embassy.
          Everyone on a different phone. It's like an emergency
          room where the patient is the whole building.
          ANN SWIFT, 31, Deputy Political Officer, has the phone by
          her ear -- trying to hear reports from D.C.

                         ANN SWIFT
          There are hundreds of people out

                         THERE --

           No, thousands... There are 

                          THOUSANDS -- 

          10 IN THE CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 10
          Mark Lijek and Bob Anders look out windows, nervous, but
          not like the Iranian VISA APPLICANTS who are close to
          panic.

                         BOB ANDERS
          Are these supposed to be 
          bulletproof?

                         MARK LIJEK
          Well, they've never been tested.

          11 INT. CHANCERY (MARINE POST ONE) - MORNING 11

          Six MARINES watch images from closed-circuit television
          cameras on chunky 1970's monitors. Crowds of protestors
          from every part of the embassy campus.
          AL GOLACINSKI, 30, chief of security for the embassy,
          shouts into a radio.

          PROTESTORS come running, turning the corner to reach the
          building. They use bats and crowbars to smash the
          windows of the building.

          13 INT. CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 13

          please?

          14 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 14

          One by one, the security monitors are going black -- or
          smashed. The Marines stare.

          15 EXT. TALEGHANI AVE. - MORNING 15

          An IRANIAN POLICE CAPTAIN smokes a cigarette, watching
          the mayhem, impassive.

          16 INT. MARINE POST ONE - MORNING 16

           MARINES are putting on armor, gas masks, riot gear. AL

          Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and

           after the release of some there, because everything --
           women and Afro-Americans it seems like everything
           but little activity in the they're trying to do is
           weeks since, and the images just backfiring, it's not
           of bound Americans under working --
          armed guard have many

          PRESIDENT CARTER (V.O.)
          The United States shall not
          purchase oil from Iran. Iranian
          assets shall be frozen and the

          nothing sleek or sexy about the interior. An open area
          of desks where Woodward and Bernstein might be spilling
          coffee on their thick 70s ties. Papers and files
          everywhere. Trash emptying happens only once a week.
          Cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays. Everything is
          perpetually a mess. And typewriters. The constant
          percussive sound of telexes and typing is the metronome
          that beats out the day here.

          Mendez walks through the terminal of a crowded 1960s-era
          airport. Newly-hung portraits of the Ayatollah Khomeini
          watch over the duty-free shops.

          SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - JANUARY 26
          The MOBS OF PEOPLE WITH BOXES OF THEIR WORLDLY BELONGINGS
          puts in high relief that Tony is going into a place that
          everyone else is desperately fleeing.

          172 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT IMMIGRATION - DAY 172

          Tony fills out a white form. It makes an impression on a
          YELLOW form.
          Tony presents his passport to a REVOLUTIONARY GUARD
          IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Official looks at it, Tony hears
          the sound of a woman screaming in Farsi.
          Three lanes away, at the outgoing immigration station, a
          Revolutionary Guard is dragging away the woman's HUSBAND.
          The Immigration Official stamps Tony's passport -- takes
          the white form, gives Tony the yellow one -- and waves
          him through.

          173 EXT. TEHRAN - DAY 173

          Archive footage may be mixed with new footage. Normal
          city life mixed with men with automatic weapons. The
          contradictions of Tehran at this moment.

          A Massive HELICOPTER SHOT OF TEHRAN. We TILT DOWN to see
          a traffic jam SPRAWLS AROUND THE AZADI MONUMENT. Bikes,
          mopeds, pedestrians, peddlers and old, patched together
          cars compete for space. No one gets anywhere.

          174 INT. TAXI - DAY 174

          Mendez sits in the back of a taxi in the Tehran traffic,
          some of the worst traffic in the world. We see the AZADI
          MONUMENT out his window.

          ANGLES OUT HIS WINDOWS
          The Ayatollah looks down from everywhere.

          MEHDI BEHROUZ, 33, is the newly appointed Deputy Minister
          of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Like many of the stars
          of the Revolution, he was educated in the U.S. Right now
          he's looking at the ARGO script.

                         BEHROUZ
          This film crew is just yourself?

                         MENDEZ

          A TAXI pulls away.
          Mendez, carrying his luggage, stands at a wrought iron
          gate with MAPLE LEAVES worked into the iron. Ken Taylor
          comes out of the building, opens the gate himself.

                         MENDEZ

          He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's
          car.

                         TAYLOR
          I was expecting more of a G-Man

          These are blank, y'know. The
          stamps?

                         MENDEZ
          I'll take care of that.

          How long?

                         MENDEZ
          A day to prep them with their
          cover stories. Two if they need
          it.

                         TAYLOR
          And you'll fly out with them?

          figured out who they are. We
          don't know if we can trust her.
          Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the
          window. Tony joins him.

                         TAYLOR

          whose envelope remains sealed.

          190 INT. SHERATON HOTEL - NIGHT 190

           A TELEFAX MACHINE spells out a message, letter by letter:

          Tony is PREPPING the CANADIAN PASSPORTS -- expertly
          copying Farsi stamps with a small sharpened stick. A
          KNOCK on the door. Tony hides the passports. Answers

          193 INT. SHERATON ROOM - NIGHT 193

          Mendez takes a small 1978 model radio out of his
          suitcase. He unscrews the casing and from inside takes
          out what looks like a 6-inch transistor board for the
          radio.
          On either side of the board: telephone jacks.
          He detaches the cords from the hotel phone and plugs them
          into the jacks on the transistor board. It's a phone
          scrambler.

          MENDEZ (V.O.)

          Mark Lijek is studying pages from the envelope Tony gave
          him. J Stafford is sitting near him, having a drink,
          watching Iranian State Television footage of the
          Ayatollah. J Stafford translates out loud.

          and... many of these people are

          nine months ago. She begged for
          us to leave. She packed our bags.
          I said, A little longer.' And
          what I was thinking was, This is

          Behrouz stands next to ALI KHALKALI, 30s, a Revolutionary

          We won't do it.

          She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin,
          which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter
          hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making
          subtle efforts to disguise themselves.

          a man talking fast in Farsi.

          203 EXT. CAR RENTAL - DAY 203

          It's a CAR RENTAL MAN, 60s, speaking. Tony is looking at

          Tony drives the minivan through streets of Tehran. The
          Houseguests sit in silence, looking out the windows.
          There is a vehement DEMONSTRATION going on -- stars-and-
          stripes burning in Molavi Square -- and it's taking place
          right in their way.
          They stop at the demonstration, then realize people
          aren't passing by as much as celebrating in the street.
          Tony is forced to nose his way through the crowd --
          chanting and yelling -- some SLAPPING THE WINDOWS.
          They finally get through and pull away. With the
          demonstration receding behind them, Tony tries to regain
          their focus.

          trucks, chaos.
          A YOUNG MAN IN SUIT WITH NO TIE waits. This is REZA, mid-
          20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of

          Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The

          They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a
          narrow street toward the bazaar.

          Reza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests
          through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the
          world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys.
          Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers,
          fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded
          down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older
          Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and
          rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like
          Bourbon Street.
          Bob Anders walks toward the front.

          It all just changed. They called
          the game. You've got to come
          back.
          ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing.

                         O'DONNELL
          (quiet, fast, clear)
          Joint Chiefs are planning a
          military rescue of the hostages in
          a month. Delta Force started
          training to storm the grounds. So
          if the six of them get brought
          down there, they won't be held for
          long.

                         MENDEZ
          I never would have exposed them if
          I wasn't authorized to take them
          out.

                         O'DONNELL
          It's over, Tony.

                         MENDEZ
          They will be taken. Probably not

                         ALIVE --

                         O'DONNELL
          LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's
          changed. Six Americans get pulled
          out of a Canadian diplomat's house
          and executed, it's another world
          outrage. Six Americans get caught
          playing movie make-believe with
          the CIA at the airport and
          executed, it's a national
          embarrassment. They're calling
          the operation.

                         MENDEZ
          We're responsible for those
          people.

                         O'DONNELL

                         (GENUINELY SAD)
          What we are is required to follow
          orders. I'm sorry.
          Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial
          tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver.

          Mendez sits at Taylor's desk, numb. Cora Lijek knocks
          but dsn't get a response. She tentatively opens the
          door and sticks her head inside.

                         CORA LIJEK
          We're ready to try again.

                         MENDEZ
          (after a beat)
          I think the most important thing 
          you can do to be ready for
          tomorrow is rest.

          Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter. Bob
          Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, puts
          them down on a table. Music plays on a record player.

                         BOB ANDERS
          Scorched earth policy tonight.
          Nothing gets left.
          Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at
          Tony.

                         MENDEZ

          Mendez looks at the Houseguests, setting the table.

                         TAYLOR
          If we tell them, they'll panic.
          It's better if you just don't
          show.

          Kathy and Cora are cracking each other up.
          No one sees Mendez take a bottle of Macallan from the
          table and put it in his bag.

          226 INT. CAR - NIGHT 226

          Mendez drives through nighttime Tehran, back to the
          hotel.
          There is a dangling TOTEM from the rearview mirror. It
          reflects light.

           A beat on Lester. He's devastated but he's not showing

          Ken Taylor watches in the hall.

          He's late.

          235 EXT. SHERATON BALCONY - DAWN 235

          Tony comes out to the balcony with a hotel ice bucket in
          one hand and the Canadian passports in the other. He
          puts the passports in the bucket, LIGHTS A MATCH.
          He looks down at the match, at the passports. The first
          stirring of the morning calls-to-prayer echo in the
          distance.
          HOLD for a long beat ON Tony. Thinking.
          Then, HE BLOWS OUT THE MATCH.

          O'Donnell is packing up for the night. Paper towels sit

          His phone rings. He picks up.

          Jordan is in a meeting with two staffers, his feet up on
          the desk. His secretary opens the door without knocking,
          hurries to Jordan, whispers something in his ear. He
          immediately grabs the phone.

                         JORDAN

          261 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - FIRST CHECKPOINT - MORNING 261

          The PASSPORT OFFICIAL is looking at the Canadian
          passports of the six and waving them through. Mendez has
          already passed. Everyone except Kathy Stafford.
          The Passport Official looks at Kathy, who is doing her
          best to look friendly and casual. Then he looks at
          Kathy's passport, in which she looks stern and angry.
          Kathy Stafford smoothes down her hair, frowns like she 
          ds in the passport photo. The Passport Official half
          smiles and waves her through. They've all cleared the
          first checkpoint.

          Bob Anders stands in front of a rough-voiced IMMIGRATION
          OFFICER. He's holding Bob Anders' YELLOW IMMIGRATION
          FORM and leafing through a file of hundreds of WHITE
          IMMIGRATION FORMS, the duplicates. Without success.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER #2
          (in Farsi; to Officer
          #1, re: his own

                         WHITE PILE)
          Nothing.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          (to Bob Anders)
          When did you say you arrived in

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          What was the purpose of your
          visit?

                         BOB ANDERS
          We were looking at locations to
          make a film. I'm the director.
          Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the
          six other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational
          as Tony acted in rehearsal.

                         BOB ANDERS

                         (VERY CALM)
          We have a letter from the Minister
          of Culture ... 
          The Immigration Officer gestures for the letter. Bob
          takes the letter inviting them on their location scout
          out of a folder. Tony, barely perceptibly, nods.

          266 INT. KOMITEH HQ - MORNING 266

          Khalkali is now speaking with MORADI, an older Komiteh
          official. They speak Farsi and it's untranslated, but we
          get it. He is showing the photograph of Mark Lijek from
          the bazaar and comparing it to the U.S. diplomatic
          photograph.
          Moradi picks up the phone as Khalkali heads out.

          Officer #2 as they look at the letter from the Minister
          of Culture. The Houseguests and Mendez wait.
          Finally, Immigration Officer #2 shrugs.

                         IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Okay -- Yes -- Okay --
          He waves them through. Second checkpoint done.

           Siegel and Chambers are walking back to the Argo office.
           They are within sight of the Argo bungalow, but a P.A. 
           steps in front of them.

           P.A.
          (a stage whisper)
          I'm sorry, we're shooting.
          He motions for them to wait. A movie -- it looks like a
          police procedural -- is shooting on the lot between them
          and the office.

          Mendez checks in with the Houseguests with his eyes.
          They are now in sight of the airport gates. And here are
          six Komiteh. Young men -- none more than 33 or so --
          holding automatic weapons.
          They have created their own checkpoint. It looks recent,

          A SCREENED-OFF AREA WITH TABLES.

                         KOMITEH #1
          Passports.
          He looks at the Canadian passports and then almost
          immediately speaks.

                         KOMITEH #1
          You come.
          He directs Mendez and the Houseguests into the screened-
          off area. Speaks in Farsi to another Komiteh.

          A young man with a beard -- AZIZI, late 20s -- arriving
          on the scene, speaking in Farsi to the others and then in
          very good American English. He looks at the six and the

          J Stafford reaches into his pocket and gives Azizi a
          copy of the Argo Variety ad.

          (to Mendez; English) 
          Kevin, where's your briefcase?
          A beat on Mendez. Who then opens his accordion folder
          and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. J Stafford
          spreads them out on the table.
          Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their
          AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the
          STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack
          Kirby's drawings.

                         J STAFFORD

          the hers... in the spice
          market...
          J Stafford points at the various drawings. He speaks
          with an ease and confidence that we didn't know he had.

          Mendez watches. It's a performance. The three young
          Komiteh are now wide-eyed, pointing, whispering in Farsi,
          like teenagers around a comic book.
          Azizi says something to another Komiteh in the room.

          One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another
          Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider
          in the storyboards. He's miming the thing crashing.
          J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can
          see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight
          dwindling.

          Azizi comes back into the screened-off area. Looks at

    Silent film, illustrated musically, with some title cards to
    indicate the dialogues, with actors whose lips move when they
    speak although we never hear their voices. The images are in
    black and white, in format 1.33.

    The letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of
    the 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and,
    in the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent
    of the light beams of a film première. Behind is a stylized
    town. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date
    appears on the screen: 1927


2   INT. LABORATORY - DAY                                        2

    In a "futuristic" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and
    bow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his
    ears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming.

    Title card:
    I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!!

    His torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually
    increase the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume
    reaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out!


3   INT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY                                 3

    Guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a
    cell!

    As the man is lying there on the ground, a dog wiggles
    through the bars at the window. The dog, a Jack Russell,
    jumps on top of the man - visibly his master - and begins to
    lick his face. The man opens one eye! When he sees his dog,
    he can't help cracking a smile...

    The man, now on his feet, looks in pain. Despite the pain, he
    motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion.

    Outside the cell, the guard looks curious about the noise. He
    goes to the door, opens the spy flap and finds himself face
    to face with the man, eye to eye just a couple of inches
    apart! The man moves his eyes in such a way that he
    hypnotizes the guard! Superimposed on the screen: a spinning
    black and white spiral, until the dazed guard take his keys,
    opens the door and releases the man and his dog.
                                                                 2.


    The man (the hero, thus) imprisons the guard without harming
    him, then runs over to the guard's desk. His ears are still
    causing him pain, but he opens a drawer and takes out his
    belongings: a top hat which he snaps open, and a mask, which
    he puts over his head to conceal his eyes.

    We catch up with the masked man walking down corridors. He
    suddenly stops, copied by his dog who follows him like his
    shadow. The man, on his guard, has spotted another guard
    where two corridors meet.

    With a look, he orders his dog to move forwards into the
    guard's line of sight. The guard looks over at the animal.
    Using his fingers, the hero pretends to shoot his dog. The
    dog collapses, plays dead. The guard, increasingly curious,
    gets to his feet. He slowly approaches the motionless dog.
    When he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero,
    who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch!

    The masked man then rushes to another cell, and releases a
    young female prisoner. She too is wearing evening dress. As
    she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in
    pain. She's concerned.

    Title card:
    Can I help you in some way?

    He refuses.

    Title card:
    No. I don't get helped.   I give the help around here.

    He composes himself. She casts him an admiring glance. Then,
    in view of the urgency of their situation, they escape at a
    run.


4   EXT. HOUSE/LABORATORY - DAY                                       4

    They come out of a house that is lost in the hills, climb
    into a Bugatti sports car that the man starts by rubbing two
    wires together, and speed off.


5   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                   5

    The car speeds along the road. Its occupants turn round to
    check they aren't being followed.
                                                              3.


6   INT. HOUSE/LAB - DAY                                           6

    The guard who got knocked out picks himself up, realizes what's
    happened and dashes over to his office. He grabs a radio
    emitter and begins sending a message.


7   EXT. AIR FIELD - DAY                                           7

    The hero, the young woman and the dog come to a halt in the
    Bugatti on the air field, by a telegraph pole whose wires
    lead...to a watch tower.

    In the watch tower, a radio receptor is vibrating. A soldier
    approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of
    his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the
    fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but
    the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before
    climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him.

    The airplane begins to move.

    The soldier shoots.

    The airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the
    soldier continues to fire!

    The aircraft gains speed.

    The soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls
    back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky...

    The soldier is furious, but the hero is all smiles as he looks
    back towards the ground and shouts something.

    Title card: Free Georgia forever!!!

    The airplane flies away into the evening sky.


8   EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                          8

    A little later in the night, still at the controls, the man is
    fighting not to fall asleep. Behind him, the women is sleeping,
    the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by
    explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't
    understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly
    notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and
    inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel
    that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and
    bursts into laughter.

    Title card: We've arrived, welcome to France!!!
                                                               4.


     As the music picks up the tune of The Marseillaise, the
     airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks...

     The words "The End" appear on the screen.


9    INT. WINGS MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                   9

     From the moment they parked the car onwards, we become
     absorbed by what's happening around the screening of end of
     this film.

     Behind the screen, we've seen the actor who plays the hero -
     his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions
     of the audience. He was standing close to his dog, motioning
     to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack.

     In the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name
     is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto
     the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on
     a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely
     the producer.


10   INT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                     10

     In the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited,
     immobile and often wide-eyed.

     In the pit, a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film.

     (9) Now that the film is ending, and the last note is
     sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict,
     which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into
     thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the
     people around him, especially the actress and the producer,
     who kiss each other on the lips.

     Two theater hands bring down the curtain.

     (10) The lights come on. George Valentin comes onto the stage
     and acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. He
     is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then
     he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to
     someone in the wings to join him. Jack the dog trots over in
     response. The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the
     dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people
     are loving it!

     In the wings, Constance is fuming with rage, but on stage,
     George is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who
     fakes death. Thunderous applause again.
                                                               5.


     Behind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and
     this enrages the actress still more.

     Suddenly, George, hamming it up, remembers something he'd
     forgotten, and asks someone from the other side of the wings
     to join him. It's Constance. She comes over, smiling to the
     audience, and says something to George with a smile.

     Title card: I'll get you for that.

     She waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her
     teeth. She isn't feeling comfortable. George motions firing a
     gun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely
     casts him a "very funny" glance. George looks at his fingers,
     not understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes
     throwing them away behind him, as though they've become
     useless. Constance stalks back off into the wings in
     annoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. Once in the wings,
     the actress sticks up her middle finger at George, and
     exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: "Put this up
     your ass." George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his
     hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few
     more dance steps as he does so. The audience is delighted.

     As he comes off stage, George gets soundly told off by
     Constance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the
     audience who are still asking for more. The producer,
     although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak
     attempt to calm the actress down. As for George, he returns
     to the stage, the audience roars. He pretends to want to
     leave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall
     just as he's leaving the stage. George holds his nose, the
     audience goes wild, Constance gets even madder, and while
     George carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks
     into a beaming smile. He's probably realized that George has
     the audience on his side... Constance, furious, storms off. She
     is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her,
     although it looks like he's got his work cut out for him.


11   EXT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                      11

     Outside, we are in front of a typically American movie theater
     decked out with all the accessories of a grand première. The
     entrance is lit up, there are crowds gathered on the sidewalk,
     cops are guarding the red carpet with a cordon of bodies, etc.

     George comes out, causing the crowds, mainly young women, to
     press forwards - and the photographers' flashes to spark into
     life. The cops are struggling to maintain control of the
     situation as George poses for the photographers and waves at
     his many fans.
                                                               6.


     In the crowd, a young woman right at the front is staring at
     him in rapture. She drops her bag and, as she bends to pick it
     up, a swell in the crowd pushes her underneath the arms of the
     policeman in front of her, out of the crowd and into George.
     She stares at him, more in love than ever, delighted to be
     there. The police wait for someone to give orders. George
     doesn't quite know what to do. Nobody moves. The young woman
     finally bursts out laughing, which, after a moment of shock,
     causes George to laugh too, thus placating the cops and tacitly
     signaling to the photographers that they can take pictures of
     the scene. The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence
     who, in a very carefree manner, begins to clown about in front
     of them. George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene
     and, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss. Flash. The
     image becomes static, then dissolves into the printed picture
     on the front page of "The Hollywood Reporter" newspaper, along
     with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHO'S
     THAT GIRL?


12   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           12

     The very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman
     sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table. We are in the large
     dining room of an ultra-luxurious Hollywood villa. All around
     her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets
     d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its
     eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third
     obscuring its mouth. George comes into the room and kisses
     his wife. She responds with cold indifference. You could cut
     the atmosphere with a knife. The woman hands George the
     newspaper. He knows what's up but tries to laugh it off. She
     doesn't find it funny, is as cold as stone and barely looks
     at him. She is obviously extremely annoyed with him. George
     picks up his dog and puts it on the table. Jack drops his
     head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her
     forgiveness. It's the exact expression of someone asking to
     be loved, but Doris is implacable. She gets up, walks away
     and does not turn back. Left on his own, George has a closed
     expression on his face. He seems unhappy to have hurt his
     wife's feelings. Then he realizes that Jack is on the table
     in a ridiculous pose, and signals to him to get down. The dog
     obeys. George looks at the paper, the cause of his problems.


13   EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET BUS - DAY                            13

     Thirteen white letters placed on a hillside.

     HOLLYWOODLAND.

     Below, in town, a bus.
                                                               7.


14   INT. BUS (DRIVING)/HOLLYWOOD - DAY                           14

     Inside the full bus is the young woman from the day before. Her
     name is Peppy Miller. She is proudly holding "The Hollywood
     Reporter" with her face on the front page, and is more or less
     discreetly making suggestive glances, hoping that someone
     recognizes her. But the people around her - from working and
     middle class backgrounds - are visibly on their way to work and
     remain impervious to her game.

     She - carefully - puts the paper away in her bag, in which four
     or five copies of the newspaper are already carefully tucked
     away, then gets off the bus at the next stop.


15   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 15

     She goes through the main gates of Kinograph Studios, and
     heads towards where they hire extras.

     In a courtyard, fifty-odd people are waiting, some sitting on
     wooden crates, others standing. There are mums with kids,
     guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. Peppy is
     among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is
     dressed in a highly stylized fashion. His job is obviously
     that of a butler. Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the
     newspaper. The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the
     newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back
     up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting
     the headline: Who's that girl ?

     Peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but
     deep down she knows he's right. Nobody knows who she is. She
     puts the newspaper away.

     A man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or
     other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes
     an announcement.

     Title card: Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance!

     All the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels,
     leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. The man says
     something to one girl, who begins to dance. He motions to her
     that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section.
     He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too.
     Then it's Peppy's turn. She puts a lot of energy into a few
     top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent
     that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired.

     Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy
     heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she
     pauses in front of the butler.
                                                                  8.


      Title card: The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller!

      She finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on,
      leaving behind the impassive butler.


16A   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                            16A

      In the lobby, George is preparing to leave the house. He
      waves at the huge, full-length portrait of himself waving and
      smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo. He looks great in the
      painting, and George is delighted to see and to wave to
      himself.


16    EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 16

      Later, George, in a luxurious car driven by his chauffeur,
      arrives at the Kinograph studios with his dog. The guard at the
      entrance smiles broadly at them and waves.


17    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY       17

      As he walks towards his dressing room, everyone smiles at him.
      He's not always fooled by these signs of respect, and apes a
      few smiles himself.


18    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY        18

      In his dressing room, wearing a tailcoat and top hat, George
      is finishing putting his make up on. He has a white face and
      dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for
      him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his
      dog. George says to him:

      Title card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice
      piece, to make it up to her.

      The chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George,
      picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it.
      As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph. He's
      written Woof Woof on it, and signed it with the paw print of
      a dog.


19    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY          19

      We're on a film set, the crew is setting up a shot. The
      director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay
      window and he sends it off.
                                                           9.


Title card: Remove that screen and bring me another one!    On
the double!

Two hands pick up the screen and carry it away. George
arrives on set, everyone smiles at him. He sits down on the
chair which bears his name. The producer whom we saw the
previous day at the première arrives. His name is Zimmer, and
he's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by -
two secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The
Hollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a
halt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is
visibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello
and vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still
pointing at the newspaper.

Title card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's
nothing about the film before page 5!

Behind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen
of sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As
they are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath.
While the producer is talking to him, George's attention is
drawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to
stand behind the screen, the top half of the body being
hidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and
is about to bring his attention back to the on-going
discussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a
noise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making,
presumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and
responds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs
instantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back,
but with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap
dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set
hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their
screen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away
and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a
young woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of
course it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who
she is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at
all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable.

Her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject
apology, but George is roaring with laughter.

After a short pause, Zimmer makes the connection. He checks
the front page of the paper, and recognizes her!

Then he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower
her head, unable to reply. He gestures that she's fired and
for her to get out, and she starts to go, completely
distraught. She's just made a couple of steps when George
stops her and tells her to come back. Everyone is surprised,
most of all him. Zimmer can't believe it, and so doesn't
respond at first.
                                                              10.


     There's bad feeling between them, as though neither wanted
     this sudden conflict, but like it had always been there,
     tangible. Everyone on the set seems to be waiting for Zimmer
     to react, but to their surprise, after a long moment of
     hesitation, he walks away without saying a thing. Peppy looks
     at George gratefully, smiling, but seems a little preoccupied
     as though she might have made a mistake.

     Everyone on set gets back to work.


20   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY        20

     They're about to start shooting. The director is showing
     George what he has to do. The scene is happening in a cabaret
     restaurant. George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he
     is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to
     change dancing partner. George finds himself dancing with
     Peppy one moment, and in the arms of a very fat man the next,
     the director finds the gag hysterical. The scene is shot
     several times from three different angles. Each time, George
     dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport
     changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then,
     with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then
     things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the
     sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the
     eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from
     the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no
     flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious
     beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing.
     It's probably love.


21   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     21

     Later on, in the dressing room corridor, Peppy, holding an
     envelope, goes up to George's door. She knocks, waits for a
     reply, then enters. There's nobody there. She hesitates, not
     sure whether to leave or stay...


22   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      22

     Finally, she goes into the room and places the envelope
     addressed to George Valentin on the dresser. Then she
     attentively looks around the dressing room. She looks at the
     objects and photos and notices, hanging from a coat stand,
     George's jacket on a hanger, and his hat which sits on a hook
     above it. The way the clothes are disposed looks like George's
     silhouette, except that the clothes are empty. She goes over,
     strokes the jacket and little by little brings George to life
     through his clothes.
                                                              11.


     She puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own
     waist. As it's George's sleeve, she makes it look like his arm
     has come to life, as though George has come to life. Even more
     so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though George
     were inside. She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when
     George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without
     any rush. George sees her, they look at each other. He closes
     the door but doesn't go over to her, instead going over to the
     mirror. He looks at her, she at him... He motions to her to
     approach. She does. He stares at her face for a while before he
     speaks.

     Title card: If you want to be an actress, you need to have
     something no one else has.

     He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her
     upper lip. She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. She
     likes it. She turns towards him and, quite naturally, folds
     into his arms. The dog watches them curiously with its head
     leaning to one side. They are probably about to kiss when
     George's chauffeur comes into the room and catches them.
     George swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of
     discomfort. The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a
     large and beautiful pearl necklace. George is intrigued by
     the necklace, and turns away from Peppy. She understands that
     George has his own life, that their embrace was just a stolen
     moment and slowly leaves, looking back at George as she does
     so. He does not look at her. She leaves the room. Once he has
     studied and necklace and is satisfied, George turns back
     towards Peppy but she is no longer there. The chauffeur exits
     the room.

     When he is alone, George looks at himself in the mirror. His
     expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in
     the world. He mimes shooting himself in the temple with his
     fingers, but it's the dog which collapses into its play-dead
     pose.


23   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             23

     The next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife. The
     atmosphere is still dreadful but this time he's not making any
     effort either. He disdainfully watches Doris eat. She is
     cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork. George watches
     her, smiles and continues to watch. Except it's not Doris he's
     watching. Instead it's Peppy who's tucking into her food and
     talking and laughing vivaciously. George is with her with an
     expression of love on his face. He's laughing with her when,
     suddenly, reality bites. He's still sitting opposite Doris,
     and she's staring at him because she doesn't understand why he
     is laughing. She visibly finds him ridiculous. He stops
     laughing and breakfast carries on as normal.
                                                                 12.


24   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              24

     We see several quick sequences which indicate time passing:

     Breakfasts with George and Doris where the atmosphere is
     increasingly dreadful. Doris scribbles on photos of George in
     the press, draws on moustaches, large spectacles, etc.


25   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PIRATE/COWBOY/ETC. - DAY                 25

     Short extracts of George in various films, in which he portrays
     a pirate, then a cowboy, then William Tell, etc. We also see
     him in "Someday in July" in the sequence he shot with Peppy and
     the fat male dancer.


26   INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDIENCE, ETC. - DAY                       26

     Movie-goers reacting to the films, but the way the images are
     edited - cut with breakfast images - could mean they are
     reacting to them too.

     Among the audience is Peppy Miller. She's trying to
     concentrate fully on the film and is pushing away the handsome
     young man she's with, who is trying to kiss her. We see her
     later, at the movies again, but this time alone.


27   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PEPPY AS A SERVANT/DANCER/ETC. - DAY     27

     We see her playing some bit parts, maid, dancer, etc. Her roles
     seem to get a little bigger. We notice that she now wears the
     beauty spot that she'll keep forever.

     Her name climbs up the ranks in the title sequences of films,
     until it appears on its own.


28   INT. OFFICE - PEPPY/CONTRACT/1927 - DAY                       28

     We see her signing a contract in a small office, she seems
     happy.


29                                                                 29
     INT. OFFICE - GEORGE/ZIMMER/CONTRACT - DAY

     George signs a big contract with Zimmer as photographers take
     pictures. He smiles broadly, whereas Zimmer looks like his
     smile is a little forced.

     The date appears on the screen: 1929
                                                                13.

     INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR - DAY

     George, dressed as a musketeer, is sword-fighting with three
     middle-ages thugs in a tavern. He kills two of them, but
     unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third. But when
     the third man attacks, George merely dodges with a sleight of
     body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook!
     Calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a
     mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape.
     The man stands up, throws aside his cape and reveals himself to
     be... Napoleon! He puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly
     thanks an astonished George. Napoleon says something to him
     and George respectfully bows, walks away from him still bowing
     then turns and runs. Once out of the decor, he bumps right into
     a worried-looking Zimmer who is followed by his loyal
     assistants. George is in a playful mood. Zimmer tells him:

     Title Card: I want to show you something.     Right now.

     George seems astonished that Zimmer is leaving the set and
     not filming, but agrees. Napoleon walks past them very
     imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him
     a chair. The technician doesn't miss the chance to remind the
     man that he is only an extra, and not Napoleon.

     INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

     Zimmer, his guards, and George - still dressed as a musketeer -
     come into a screening room in which a dozen or so very serious-
     looking people are waiting. They sit down and Zimmer, very
     proudly and self-confidently, gestures to an assistant who
     passes on the message to the projectionist. The room goes dark.
     The screening begins.


32                                                                32
     INT. VOICE TEST STUDIO - DAY

     On screen we see a card that indicates it's a sound shooting
     test for a talking scene. Then Constance appears, the actress
     from the spy film. She's standing in front of a mic and she
     tests it, delighted to be there. Cut. We see her again, the
     microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene. It's a
     monologue. Her acting is terrible, very theatrical, but the
     audience can hear her. It is however, awful.

     (31) In the screening room, the audience seems stunned by
     what they see/hear. They are fascinated. They then begin to
     congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back. Zimmer's
     pride seems to grow by the second.

     George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a
     snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the
     actress earnestly ends her monologue.
                                                              14.


     When the lights come up, George is laughing uncontrollably
     way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is
     obvious. The people present are embarrassed, and Zimmer is
     deeply put out. George, still laughing, leaves the room,
     waving an apology with his hands as he goes, but also
     pointing to the screen to explain why he's laughing. Zimmer
     feels even more humiliated. Fade to black on his face.


33   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      33

     We're back with George in his dressing room. He's removing his
     make up. He moves some ordinary object and the object, as he
     moves it, makes a noise. We hear the noise it makes. Really
     hear it. It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes
     from within the film itself. One second later, George realizes
     that the object made a noise. He moves it again, the object
     makes a noise again. George is worried. He tries another object
     and obtains noise again. His dog barks and we hear it! He gets
     up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no
     sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. He realizes
     this... Panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking
     again, but still no sound comes out. Not understanding what's
     happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his
     dressing room!


34   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     34

     Noisy, laughing dancers pass in the corridor, others are
     talking or shouting and even if we can't make out what they are
     saying, they are all making sound. George tries to talk to them
     but his voice remains silent. One dancer, seeing his fright,
     bursts into throaty laughter. George rushes through the
     milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly
     loud...


35   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - COURTYARD - DAY                   35

     ...and bursts out into the courtyard of the studio that is now
     suddenly deserted and silent. In front of him a feather eddies
     slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze. It finally lands,
     making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like
     that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion.
     George screams, but again his cry is silent.


36   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT               36

     George awakes with a start! He's in bed and is having trouble
     shaking off his nightmare.

     The film continues as normal: in other words, silent.
                                                               15.


     His wife is sleeping by his side. He gets up, taking care not
     to make a sound.


37   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            37

     George calms down as he sits in the living room, alone in the
     darkness. Jack, still sleepy, has just curled into a ball
     next to him to fall back to sleep. George smiles and gives
     him a pat.


38   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY     38

     Driven by his chauffeur, George crosses town heading for the
     studios.


39                                                               39
     EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY

     The car goes through the studio gates. There's nobody there.
     George gets out. He goes into the courtyard. There's nobody
     there either.


40   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR SET - DAY             40

     He goes into the studio and heads for the set. There is still
     no one about. He doesn't understand and goes back outside.


41   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                41

     Outside in the deserted courtyard, a feather eddies towards
     the ground, carried by the breeze. George is watching it drift
     to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring
     back into the sky. George follows it with his eyes and notices
     a man crossing between two sets. He looks like some kind of set
     hand or assistant; a working man in any case. George calls to
     him. The two men draw close and George asks him what's
     happening. The man takes the day's newspaper out of his pocket
     and hands it to George before walking off. George reads:
     Kinograph Studios stop all silent productions to work
     exclusively on talkies.


42   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY           42

     Despite the secretary's attempts to stop him, a furious George
     storms into Zimmer's office.
                                                              16.


43   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY                43

     Zimmer is in a meeting with some men. They are probably
     engineers in view of the attention being given to the plans
     lying on the desk. Everyone is surprised by George's rude
     entry. The engineers seem embarrassed, but Zimmer smiles and
     politely asks them to leave, as though asking for their
     understanding. As they head for the door, some of them drop
     their heads so as not to meet George's eyes, whereas others
     look him right between the eyes but without any love lost. This
     exchange causes a strange, unpleasant feeling within him. He
     seems embarrassed. It's perhaps due to the rudeness of his
     eruption into the office, but it's more likely due to the looks
     he's been given. For the first time for ages, he has not been
     looked at how a star is normally looked at - with respect,
     desire and admiration - but like any ordinary man is looked at
     or, worse still, how a superfluous man is looked at.

     As George realizes that his status has just changed, Zimmer
     invites him to sit down. Then speaks to him, in a friendly
     manner.

     Title card: We belong to another age, you and I, George.
     Nowadays, the world talks.

     He talks to him, looks a little embarrassed, while George
     takes it on the chin, not knowing how to respond.

     Title card: People want to see new faces. Talking faces.

     George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to
     bring up a smile.

     Title card: Paramount will be delighted. They still want me.

     Zimmer responds with a pursing of the lips that is more
     damning than any counter argument could be. As though he's
     telling George he can always give it a go... George understands
     what's happening. Zimmer is sorry.

     Title card: I'm sorry. The public wants fresh blood. And the
     public is never wrong.

     George gets to his feet.

     Title card: It's me the people want and it's my films they
     want to see. And I'm going to give them to them.

     Zimmer nods with another pursing of the lips, as though he
     can't wait to see that. George seems very sure of himself.

     Title card: I don't need you. Go make your talking movies.
     I'm going to make them a beautiful film!
                                                              17.


     As George leaves in disgust, his eyes are drawn to an
     advertising feature representing the "new faces of Kinograph
     Studios". Among the medallion framed young portraits, George
     recognizes that of Peppy Miller. He glances up at Zimmer.

     Title card: Fresh blood...

     The two men exchange a last glance, then George exits.


44   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS, SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY            44

     Outside he feels a few seconds of discouragement but, as he
     meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretary's
     antechamber, he puffs up his chest and walks tall out of the
     office.


45   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - STAIRS - DAY                       45

     Going down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing
     Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect
     specimens of America's golden youth. She is coming up, he is
     going down. When she notices him, she stops, already one step
     above of him. She has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to
     see him. He is delighted too, although his mood is very
     different.

     Title card (him): How are you?

     Title card (her): Fantastic! I've been given a lead role!
     Isn't it wonderful?!

     He nods, we see in his eyes that he's terribly happy for her.
     They look at each other, she laughs.

     Then she fumbles in her bag for something with which to note
     down her telephone number on a piece of paper. It takes a
     while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly
     takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her. She finally gets
     the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her -
     to really call her. In response he casts a glance over to the
     young men waiting for her higher up the stairs, and she
     bursts out laughing. She leans towards him to say something.

     Title card: Gadgets!

     She looks at him flirtatiously. Then she gestures again for
     him to call her, and he nods, even though we think that he
     probably will not do so. She leaves and he watches her go
     before beginning his decent once more. Once at the top, she
     turns back to call out to George, he too has turned to look.
     She smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's
     sake, then blows him a kiss.
                                                              18.


     He catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it
     disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her
     the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's
     keeping it safe and warm. She laughs loudly and goes on her
     way. He watches her walk away with admiration in his eyes.
     She vanishes and George's smile takes on a note of
     melancholy, and then he leaves too.

47   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           47

     George comes home. Doris is there scribbling on a magazine but
     he takes no notice of her. When the dog jumps into his arms
     however, he greets it affectionately. Doris is vexed.


48   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             48

     A while later he's running Jack through his tricks when Doris
     arrives.

     Title card: We have to talk, George.

     George smiles.

     Title card: Or not.

     She insists but he doesn't listen. He's with his dog. She
     gets annoyed, he doesn't answer, she ends up throwing Jack.
     George cannot forgive her for doing so, he looks at her in
     disgust. She starts to cry.

     Title card: I'm unhappy, George.

     He answers without looking at her.

     Title card: So are millions of other people, me for instance.


49   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              49

     Thanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings,
     we see George begin making his film, the first clap of the
     board that shows he's both the film's producer and director.
     The film is called Tears of love, and it tells the tale of an
     English adventurer - played by himself - accompanied by a young
     woman, an old man who looks like a professor and who is
     probably the father of the young woman and, lastly, an African
     tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be
     proven.
                                                              19.


     We see George in the various stages of preparation: writing, re-
     writing, directing, acting, signing a lot of checks, but also
     leaving very early in the morning to set up shots with his
     collaborators, etc. He looks fulfilled, like he truly believes
     in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling. His dog
     has a role in the film too, doing tricks. George looks very
     happy, very committed. He takes a supple branch, feeds it
     through the sleeves of a woman's blouse and, by holding the two
     ends of the branch out in front of him, dances with the
     imaginary woman. Everyone around him is happy and laughing.
     He's not shooting a comedy, however, it's obviously a drama of
     some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors
     play their role.

     Then appear on screen the mock ups of posters, they are shown
     on the set to George.

     He chooses the one in which he is most prominent, it's a poster
     depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date
     October 25th.


50                                                              50
     OMITTED


51   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET (POSTERS) - DAY                    51

     In the street, at the entrance to a movie theater, George sees
     a large "Beauty Spot" film poster. The poster shows Peppy close
     up, wearing a magnificent and jauntily positioned chapka over
     one eye. She is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish, more
     the image of a young comedy debut... George looks at her, Peppy
     seems to be smiling at him. He smiles back. Then his smile
     becomes strained. He's noticed something. The two theater
     employees are sticking a banner over the poster that reveals
     the release date of Beauty Spot - it's also October 25th.


52   INT. ANIMATION STAND - DAY                                 52

     Then we see advertising inserts and full page press articles
     appearing one after the other, creating a montage of images
     with a very 1920's feel. "Get some Peps with Peppy!" and a
     close up on her smiling, mischievous face. "The girl next
     door", "The girl you'll love to love" "Young and pretty", etc.
     with a photo of Peppy each time, posters of the film and then,
     everywhere, the face that it's a talking movie! Talking,
     talking, talking!

     As for George, his image is a lot more austere, the photographs
     show him as very serious. And the captions are like: "I'm not a
     muppet anymore, I'm an artist!"
                                                              20.

54   INT. RESTAURANT INTERVIEW - DAY                              54

     We're in a smart restaurant. George has his back to the room
     and is eating with his chauffeur. Peppy comes into the
     restaurant and comes to sit just behind George. They are back
     to back. She is with several young men, two of whom are
     journalists and they are interviewing her.

     Title card: Your first film doesn't come out until tomorrow
     and yet you're already the new darling of Hollywood! How do
     you explain that?

     She starts by bursting into laughter, which draws George's
     attention. He turns round to listen to the rest of Peppy's
     answer.

     Title card: I don't know, maybe it's because I talk. And
     people hear me.

     She continues talking, obviously happy that people are
     interested in her. She doesn't see George smiling behind her.

     Title card: People are sick to death of those old actors who
     pull faces to make themselves understood.

     She continues talking with the casual arrogance of youth.
     Behind her, George's smile vanishes.

     Title card: Anyway, it's normal for the young to take over
     from the old, that's life. Make way for youth!

     George is hurt. He gets up and, before he leaves, gestures
     silently that if she wants his place all she has to do is
     take it. She watches him leave and immediately regrets what
     she's just said.


55   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             55

     It's the day of the films' release, October 25th.

     It's morning. George opens his front door. His chauffeur is
     outside. The man's expression announces bad news. He's holding
     the day's press. The huge headlines talk of a stock market
     crash, a black Thursday, a catastrophe.

     Dressed in a robe, George is on the telephone in the living
     room. He nods. The atmosphere is stifling. He hangs up. His
     chauffeur looks at him inquisitively. George replies as though
     lost in thought:
                                                              21.


     Title card: It would seem that we're ruined.

     The chauffeur takes it on the chin with as much reserve as he
     can muster, but George continues.

     Title card: That's the best case scenario...

     He almost laughs - not so the chauffeur.


56   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           56

     Now wearing a suit, George is sitting at his desk. Lying in
     front of him are the front pages of newspapers reporting the
     Crash. He looks for something on the inside pages of one paper
     and reads. Next to a large picture of Peppy there's a review of
     his own film, beginning "Tears of Love, Old and Boring". He
     shuts the paper and searches for something in the drawer of his
     desk. He takes out a piece of paper. It's the telephone number
     that Peppy had scribbled down for him. He looks at it, moves
     closer to the telephone, hesitates, looks at the paper again,
     then puts the scrap of paper back in the drawer without making
     the call.


57   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                         57

     Peppy awakes in bed with a start. She doesn't know what has
     woken her up. She looks around, looks at the phone, seems
     perplexed. Then a man's arm invites her to lie back down; she
     does.

     (56) Still at his desk, George gets up and goes to the
     window. He seems lost in thought.


58   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              58

     An extract from "Tears of Love" in which we see George, holding
     the young woman in his arms, take part in a cliché-d African
     dance with shields, spears and all the African accoutrements
     attributed by Westerners at the time. George and the woman are
     complacently watching the dance, when George says to the young
     woman.

     Title card: Let's go back, Norma. They've never seen a white
     woman before and I don't want to take any risks.


59   INT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" SCREENING - DAY       59

     There's hardly anyone in the theater. The people that are there
     look bored more than anything. At the back smoking a cigarette,
     George takes the failure on the chin.
                                                               22.


     One couple gets to their feet and leaves the theater. As the
     man reaches George, he recognizes him and casts him a glance
     that seems to say "goodness old chap this one's not up to
     much..." George doesn't know what to say in reply.


60   EXT. MOVIE THEATERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                       60

     Outside, George comes out still smoking his cigarette. On the
     sidewalk, people are cheerfully waiting in line. George walks
     up the line and comes to a movie house that's playing the
     "Beauty Spot" talking movie. A huge poster depicts Peppy and
     the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going
     to see the film. It's visibly a success. George takes it on the
     chin.


61   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY       61

     Inside the car, behind the implacable chauffeur, George is
     talking to himself, as though he's re-running the story in
     his head and searching for what he might have done better, or
     differently.


62   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              62

     Once home, he finds a photo of himself on the floor. It has
     been defaced with a scribbled moustache, spectacles and a big
     nose. There's a note to him scribbled on the back. We read it
     at the same time as him.

     It's over, George. You've got a fortnight to collect your
     souvenirs together and get out of the house.

     Doris
     P.S.: You should go see Beauty Spot, it's incredible.

     George takes it on the chin and leaves, revealing behind him
     the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo, smiling and waving.


63   INT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" SCREENING - DAY          63

     As for Peppy, she's in the theater, watching Tears of love.
     She's with a handsome young man who seems bored.


64   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                             64

     George is wearing shorts and an explorer's hat. He is sinking
     in sinking sand. The young woman is screaming and the dog
     barking.
                                                                23.


     The Africans are panicking but there's nothing anyone can do.
     George stops struggling, and looks deep into the eyes of the
     young woman. He says gently:

     Title card: Farewell, Norma.    I never loved you...

     It's obvious he's only saying that so that she can forget him
     and move on with her life, but it doesn't wash and the young
     woman weeps all the more, terribly moved by this last
     sacrifice on his part.

     (63) In the balcony, Peppy is speechless and her face
     impassive.

     (64) On screen, George and the young women exchange a last
     glance as George's face gradually sinks into the sand.

     (63) Next to Peppy, the young man sits watching her. She sees
     sad.

     (64) On screen, George has disappeared into the mire. Only
     one hand stays in the air for several seconds more in a
     tortured pose, that of a dying man trying to hold on to the
     wind.

     (63) Peppy's companion seems to find the film far too long
     and doesn't understand why they haven't already left.

     (64) The hand has disappeared. The young woman is in a state
     of shock, rigid with a look of horror on her face. She is no
     doubt about to be put to certain death. The dog turns round
     and walks off with head and tail lowered...

     The End appears on the screen.

     (63) Peppy seems moved. She is shaking her head from side to
     side.


65   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - PICTURE OF GEORGE - EVENING        65

     Evening has fallen on the town. It's raining. On the ground
     lies an old page from a newspaper that bears a picture of
     George. A man's feet trample the picture.


66   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - NIGHT                           66

     George is   at home. Two bottles are apparent and, obviously
     drunk, he   is staring out the window. The projection of
     raindrops   sliding down the window look like tears running down
     his face.   And Jack's face too. George is pulled out of his
     stupor as   he hears something.
                                                              24.


67   EXT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - TOP STEP - NIGHT                 67

     He opens the door. It's Peppy. She immediately notices that
     George is drunk. Her smile tenses a little.

     Title card: I wanted to talk, I...

     George looks at her. She continues.

     Title card: I saw Tears of Love.

     George nods, and answers.

     Title card: And so you've come to get your money back?

     She smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.   He continues.

     Title card: Too much face-pulling?

     She stops smiling because it's not funny at all. It's bitter,
     even. There's an embarrassed silence. Softly, she tries to
     explain.

     Title card: About last night...

     She stops because George is not looking at her anymore. He's
     watching the arrival of the young, smiling, handsome and
     wholesome man who is with Peppy. George bears a melancholy
     smile.

     Title card: You're right. Make way for youth...

     The young man shakes George's hand. He's obviously a nice
     lad, and very polite.

     Title card: I'm so happy to meet you. My Dad just loves you.

     He says it very nicely, with no ulterior motive, but George
     is cut to the quick. The comment wounds him and Peppy
     notices. She cuts short the meeting by smiling and upping the
     cheerfulness stakes, as though to kid George she hasn't
     noticed any embarrassment or perceived anything that might
     have shocked or hurt him during their encounter.

     Title card: OK! Well, we'll be off now.   I'll call you soon.
     Bye!

     George smiles politely. She leaves, taking the handsome jock
     with her. George watches them leave. As does his dog, who
     sits with his head and ears hanging low as though very
     disappointed. George watches Peppy walking away, then steps
     forwards and sits down on the steps leading up to the house.
                                                              25.


     As she gets into the car, Peppy seems surly, unhappy even,
     for the first time. She turns her back on her companion.

     Title card: Take me home. I'd like to be alone.

     George watches the car leave, then goes and sits on a bench
     next to the front door. But the bench breaks and George finds
     himself on the ground next to the dog. George remarks evenly
     to Jack:

     Title card: See, could be it just wasn't my day...

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.


68   EXT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" - DAY                    68

     In the rain, a worker is taking down letters from the facade
     of a theater. Of Tears of Love, only the word Tears remains.


69   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          69

     Peppy is facing her mirror and putting her make up on. She
     takes a break, looking a little sad. Someone (some kind of
     assistant) opens the door to her dressing room and says
     something like you need to hurry up. She nods and gets back
     to work.


70   EXT. MOVIE POSTERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                        70

     Alternate shots of three or four film posters and frames from
     them which illustrate Peppy's rising fame. Her name moves
     higher up the posters and into bigger letters. The films are
     called "The Rookie", "The Brunette ", "The Girl Next Door" and,
     finally, "On the Roof ".


71                                                                 71
     OMITTED


72   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          72

     We catch up with her in a close up, applying her make up. The
     camera pulls back and we see that not only is she not putting
     the make up on herself - a make up artist is doing that - but
     there are in fact four pairs of hands getting busy around her;
     two make up girls, a hairdresser and a wardrobe assistant.
     Peppy, fortunately, has stayed completely natural and doesn't
     seem to take any of it seriously. As the last touch is put in
     place, Peppy gets to her feet and turns round.
                                                              26.


     At her feet lie a dozen pairs of shoes, each pair as
     magnificent as the next, and all in their swanky boxes. Peppy
     tries on a pair. Close up of her feet.


73   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE (1931) - DAY                              73

     Crossfade to a man's pair of shoes with used heels and uppers.
     George's dog comes to sit at his feet. The date is superimposed
     on the screen: 1931.

     The camera climbs up his legs to reveal George lying fully
     dressed in his bed, obviously at home in view of his attitude.
     He's changed. And even if his suit is still pretty smart, he's
     become more "common", less unattainable. He seems to have lost
     whatever it was that made him so superb. Primarily he's a bit
     drunk, somewhat hesitant. George gets up and closes his Murphy
     bed, the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a
     closet. Then he walks across the living area. His home has
     changed too, it's fallen in class and is a lot more modest than
     the one we were used to seeing him in. We do however recognize
     some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old
     house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling. He goes into
     the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment.
     There's nothing in the refrigerator. He looks for something to
     drink but there's only one bottle left in the rack. He lifts it
     up. It's empty.

     He opens a closet. Inside, a tuxedo hangs among a number of
     bare hangers.


74   INT. PAWNSHOP - DAY                                           74

     In a pawnshop, George, still a little drunk, is selling his
     tuxedo. The pawnbroker and he are visibly disagreeing on the
     price, but of course it's George who folds first and hands
     over the tuxedo. The pawnbroker counts out the bills and
     hands them to George who, in a fit of pride, leaves a tip as
     he leaves - his dignity intact even in the face of adversity.


75   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     75

     At home, George is drinking and watching his chauffeur fix some
     food. He seems preoccupied.

     Title card: How long's it been since I paid you last,
     Clifton?

     The chauffeur answers as he carries on doing what he's doing.

     Title card: Been one year now, Sir.
                                                              27.


     George gets up, visibly thinking that he shouldn't have done
     that, that it's wrong. He go gets the keys and a jacket,
     comes back and gives them to the chauffeur.

     Title card: You're fired. Keep the car. Get yourself a job
     someplace else.

     The chauffeur refuses, George insists. They don't agree but
     George ends up throwing him out, even though we've understood
     that he's doing it for Clifton's benefit and not through any
     unkindness.


76   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     76

     Once outside, the chauffeur doesn't move. He stays next to the
     car. George watches him through the window. The chauffeur
     still doesn't budge. George pulls the curtains.


77   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EVENING                                 77

     In the evening, George looks out between the curtains, the
     chauffeur is still there. George turns on his heels and gets
     into his Murphy bed.


78   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         78

     Night time. George is in bed with his eyes open.


79   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   79

     Outside, the chauffeur is still in the same position.


80   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     80

     The next morning, George gets up and goes to look from the
     window. The chauffeur has gone. George is a little sad, but
     that's just the way it is... He looks around at his home.

     A little later, George looks at himself in a mirror. We pass
     from him to his reflection, which he hides by placing his drink
     against the mirror.


81   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - DAY                                      81

     A sign says that the effects of George Valentin are to be
     auctioned. Furniture, costumes, objets d'art and paintings on
     September 14th. There aren't many people in the room, just five
     or six. George is standing at the back, smoking a cigarette.
                                                              28.


     His position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching
     the screening of Tears of Love, from the back of the room with
     the verdict of failure in the air...

     He's looking a little unsteady on his feet, probably due to the
     hip flask he's necking that seems to contain liquor. The
     objects go under the hammer one by one. We see the three
     monkeys go by, notably, hear no evil, speak no evil, see no
     evil. Two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding
     against each other, a distinguished and reserved-looking man,
     and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe, to the
     point of bigotry. They don't seem perfectly comfortable, but
     they are the only two buying.

     A few crossfades (the display table emptying, faces, hands
     being raised, hammer falling, "sold" labels) show us the lots
     disappearing - every single item is sold.


82   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - CORRIDOR - DAY                           82

     George is now with the auctioneer, he's studying the list of
     items as auction assistants busy themselves around him,
     carrying and packing the sold lots. The auctioneer, who is
     putting on his coat, congratulates George.

     Title card: Well done! It all sold, there's nothing left!

     George nods but his smile seems a little ironic. He leaves
     the room.

     On the stairway, as he's leaving, he is joined by the
     distinguished-looking man who puts on his coat and leaves.


83   EXT. AUCTION ROOM'S STREET - DAY                              83

     They leave at the same time. The man crosses the street, we
     follow him.

     He gets into a car. Peppy is sitting in the back. She's alone
     and watching George walk off with his unsteady gait. She's sad.
     The man casts a glance to ask her what he should do next.
     Peppy, with a forced smile, motions that they can leave. As the
     man starts up the motorcar, George is walking away. The car
     sets off and overtakes him. Peppy does not turn round. She's
     crying.


84   INT. CLANDESTINE BAR - NIGHT                                  84

     George, dressed differently, is drinking in a clandestine bar
     that has made the effort of putting up a few Christmas
     decorations. George is visibly smashed.
                                                              29.


85   INT. STUDIO JUNGLE ENCRUSTED LITTLE GEORGE - NIGHT            85

     A small version of him appears superimposed on the bar, dressed
     as an explorer and discovering the life-size version of
     himself. The big version watches the little version load his
     rifle. Then the little version shoots at the big version, but
     the big version just smiles.

     Little version runs off shot to get help, and he comes back
     with a tribe of African warriors, all bearing spears. They
     attack.

     Big version tries to defend himself, staggers as he gets to his
     feet, tries to gesture to the barman, but he is so drunk that
     he falls straight backwards without making the slightest
     attempt to stop his fall. The Africans leap about with joy.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

     (84) George's chauffeur comes into the bar. He motions to the
     barman who jerks his head in one direction. The chauffeur
     follows the indication and finds George lying on the floor,
     totally smashed. He slaps him gently around the face a few
     times in a vain attempt to wake him, then lifts him over his
     shoulder, pays the check and leaves.


86   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   86

     At George's house, his chauffeur puts him to bed and hangs his
     suit carefully before leaving the room. He sees the dog, goes
     over to it and strokes it. They look at each other. We can tell
     that the chauffeur is worried about George.


87   EXT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - DAY                           87

     Peppy Miller is "The Guardian Angel". It's a huge poster on the
     façade of a movie theater. George goes inside. With Jack.


88   INT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - DAY                           88

     The auditorium is full. George sits down in the first row. To
     watch the film he has to look upwards, and sees a huge and
     magnificent Peppy rising above him. She's playing a scene with
     a young actor we recognize, it's Humphrey Bogart. He's become a
     spectator: he laughs, is absorbed and cries along with the
     others.
                                                               30.


89   INT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - CORRIDOR & LOBBY - DAY       89

     Coming out of the theater several young people bump into him.
     They don't recognize him. There's a lot of people milling
     about, so he picks Jack up. A woman exclaims an Oh! of
     admiration as though she's recognized George. He smiles
     modestly but soon realizes that it's just because she thinks
     Jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any
     other dog. She is totally under Jack's charm, and says to
     George.

     Title card: If only he could talk!

     George still has the smile on his lips, but it has become one
     of resignation.

     He looks away as the woman strokes the dog.


90   EXT. MEXICAN VILLAGE - DAY                                   90

     George is playing Zorro. He performs stunt after stunt and the
     close ups show his devastating smile to its best advantage. In
     fact, it's an extract from The Mark of Zorro with Douglas
     Fairbanks, into which we'll insert close ups of Jean we've shot
     ourselves.


91   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    91

     The Zorro sequence is being screened on a wall in George's
     apartment. George is watching himself, slumped in an easy
     chair. His sluggish attitude and listless air are in sharp
     contrast with the image of himself projected by the film.

     Then the image jumps and goes white. George gets up, still half-
     smashed. His shadow is clearly delineated on the white screen.
     He sees it, looks it up and down and then starts to look at it
     sideways.

     Title card: Look what you've become...

     He carries on shouting at it, obviously very annoyed with it.

     Title card: You were very nasty! And stupid! And arrogant!

     He doesn't even want to look at it anymore. He looks
     disgusted. Suddenly his shadow separates itself from him and
     moves independently from him. As he shouts at it, it lowers
     its head and doesn't reply.

     Title card: You acted very badly! You were thoughtless!
                                                               31.


     He carries on as though it's normal until his shadow walks
     off with its head bowed. He watches it go, trying to
     understand what's happening, but it's gone and he's still
     there. He begins to holler.

     Title card: COME BACK! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!

     Totally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels
     against the wall as he hollers. The cans split open and the
     film bursts out all over. George is becoming more and more
     frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He
     stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a
     moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider
     what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of
     the reels.

     There's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold.
     We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's
     very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an
     instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and
     barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He
     doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is
     spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where
     the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins
     throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's
     looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness
     of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible.
     On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs
     off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with
     the cans of reels.


92   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    92

     The dog comes out of the house and makes a dash for the
     sidewalk as fast as he can.

     (91) In the room, among the flames and the smoke, George -
     now breathless - picks one of the reels and tries to turn
     round. He collapses, still holding on to the can.


93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93

     Jack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's
     trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards
     George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and
     pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but
     the cop just wants to be left in peace.

     (91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke
     is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face.
                                                              32.


     (93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels
     uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively.
     Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be
     silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George
     miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has
     no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog
     to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but
     stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with
     him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who
     tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a
     moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack
     encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin
     with. Little by little though, as though realizing the
     seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more,


94   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    94

     until he finally arrives flat out at George's home. The cop
     sees the smoke coming out of the house. He runs into the smoke.


95   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    95

     A completely unconscious George, overcome by the fumes, is
     dragged out of the fire by the policeman.


96   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    96

     They come out the house. George is still clutching the reel. A
     crowd has formed, people recognize him. One woman feels sorry
     for him, a man runs for help. George is unconscious.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.


97   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY              97

     We see Peppy on a shoot, sitting in a chair with her name on
     it, smoking a cigarette. Everyone about her is busy preparing a
     shot. Suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone. She takes
     the receiver with a smile and listens. Her expression tightens
     a little. She hangs up, pensive for a moment. On set,the
     director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and
     they are good to go. The assistant goes towards Peppy to let
     her know but, as he gets to where she should be, her seat is
     empty. He looks everywhere for her, but she has disappeared.


98   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             98

     In her car, and still in costume, she urges her chauffeur to go
     quick as he can.
                                                                 33.


99    EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - DAY                                99

      The car pulls into the hospital courtyard.


100   INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY AND STAIRS - DAY                      100

      Peppy bursts into the lobby, talks to a woman at the desk who
      directs her with a raised hand that Peppy immediately follows.

      She bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a
      corridor,


101   INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR AND GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY            101

      and then to a door through the window of which she sees
      George lying down. His dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep.
      George is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. A
      doctor is in the room with a nurse.

      Peppy enters. She's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring.

      Title card: He's not in any danger now. He just needs to
      rest.

      Peppy goes up to George. She notices that his burnt hands
      seem to still be clutching something. She's intrigued. In
      response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in
      a corner of the room.

      Title card: He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it
      away from him.

      Peppy picks up the can. The label is too damaged to be able
      to read the title of the film. She opens it and unrolls some
      of the film in front of the window. We see random photograms
      run by. It's the only sequence they ever shot together, years
      before. Peppy is moved. Without turning round, she asks the
      doctor:

      Title card: Do you think he could come rest up at my place?

      The doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye.

      Title card: It's probably the very best he could have hoped
      for.


102   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    102

      An ambulance takes George, still unconscious, to Peppy's
      house. Jack is with him.
                                                                 34.


      It's a large, beautiful house, very expensive and very
      Hollywood. But it's also very inviting.


103   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM & CORRIDOR - NIGHT    103

      It's night time. George is in bed. He opens one eye. Then he
      wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is.

      Jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. A nurse who had been
      dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then
      goes over to George. She reassures him, motions to him not to
      get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down
      the corridor. She knocks at a door then goes back to George's
      room. Peppy is close on her heels. She comes into the room in
      her nightgown. When he sees her, George smiles and she rushes
      over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. She is
      terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk
      to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and
      so was not sharing the same special moment as she. She pulls a
      face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over
      at the nurse, then lays George's head back on his pillow.


104   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                 104

      The next morning, Peppy brings breakfast into George's room
      and they eat it together. She laughs, talks, eats, drinks and
      is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years
      before. He looks at her with a smile on his face. Then she
      looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry.

      Title card: I've got to go. I have to be on set for nine
      o'clock.

      George smiles kindly at her. She returns the smile but we can
      tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is
      working, and he is not. They exchange a last glance before
      she leaves the room.

      George, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. He picks up
      a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. It's his jacket
      and pants, both half burned. On the floor, his shoes are in
      exactly the same state of disrepair.


105   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    105

      A little later, and alone, he's exploring the house. It's
      richly and tastefully decorated, highly personal. He goes
      along a corridor and down a wide stairway. Jack begins sniffing
      outside of one door, as though he wants to go inside.
                                                               35.


106   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                        106

      George opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of
      storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. He
      closes the door behind him. The room has a ghostly quality to
      it. Jack sniffs about everywhere. George too seems troubled by
      the strange pervading atmosphere. His curiosity is spurred by
      a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. A ray of
      light surges into the room. The door has opened and, standing
      against the daylight, is a maid.

      Title card: You should go back to your room, Sir.

      George nods with a smile. The maid leaves pretty swiftly, we
      haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange.
      George is intrigued but leaves the room. He has to call Jack
      to him. Jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.


107   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY             107

      A screenplay lies on a table. Peppy and Zimmer are seated
      either side of the table and are talking animatedly. We're on
      the set we saw the previous day, and Peppy seems to be trying
      to convince Zimmer of something. She seems to be describing a
      film poster or the façade of a movie theater she'd love to see.
      He doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative
      shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to
      Peppy. She finally stops talking and gives him a determined
      look. Zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies.

      Title card: George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the
      past. Today he's a nobody.

      As Zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat.
      Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking.

      Title card: What are you doing?

      She looks him straight in the eyes, and answers:

      Title card: I'm stopping work. It's him or me.

      She looks determined. He's looking unsure of himself. He
      visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. She drives her
      point home.

      Title card: What I mean is it's either him AND me! Or neither
      of us!

      Zimmer still isn't sure he's understood. He just looks at
      her.

      Title card: I'm blackmailing you, get it?!
                                                                36.


      Even when she's blackmailing, she's still pretty, and Zimmer
      looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time it's
      obvious that he's going to back down. The people around them
      are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting
      for his decision. There's an element of déjà-vu to the
      situation, and Zimmer, who already backed down a few years
      before, gives in.

      Title card: And why not...

      She smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and
      leaves. As he moves away she whistles at him. He turns round
      and she vigorously blows him a kiss.


108   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             108

      The screenplay lies on the front seat of a car. The camera
      pulls back, it's Clifton who is in the driving seat.


109   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                  109

      George is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in. At
      first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into
      astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. The
      chauffeur answers:

      Title card: I work for Miss Miller now.

      George visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he
      remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. It's as though
      something has come between them. The chauffeur places the
      screenplay on the bedside table. George seems to greet it
      with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm.

      The chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts
      on a plate for George. George doesn't want any, it's all too
      much...

      Before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual
      reserve for the first time and says to George:

      Title card: She's been good to you. She's always looked out
      for you.

      The chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George
      further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.
                                                               37.


110   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  110

      From the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and
      drive off. We recognize the car as being the one that belonged
      to George.

      (109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems
      to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.


111   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      111

      George goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes
      straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up
      the sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the
      three monkeys "hear no evil", "speak no evil" and "see no
      evil". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to
      reveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used
      to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the
      auction room.

      After taking off several other sheets, George realizes that
      she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture,
      paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets
      one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his
      suits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting
      depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks
      stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's
      interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room
      once more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid.

      George walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets
      to them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize
      that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking
      man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid
      is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale
      prices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has
      recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks
      off, still shocked by what he's just realized.


112   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY               112

      He finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room, and leaves.


113   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  113

      He goes down the stairs and flees the house.
                                                               38.


114   EXT. BEGGAR STREET - DAY                                  114

      George is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged
      shoes. He is shirtless. With Jack by his side, he walks along
      the sidewalk. There are a few other people walking along. About
      twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. He holds out his
      hand to passers-by. George approaches and, when there are no
      other passers-by between him and George, the beggar glances at
      him and lowers his hand. He doesn't raise it as George
      approaches. George stops in front of him and looks at him, but
      the beggar motions to him to scram. George continues on his
      way. For that moment at least, he has become one of them.

      He buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the
      fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses
      himself in the crowd. Some distance later, he stops to check
      his reflection in a shop window. The image he sees is that of a
      bum. It's even more striking because the in the window there is
      a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf.
      The image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed.

      A cop comes up to George and begins talking to him in a
      friendly manner. He speaks but we don't know what about. There
      is not Title card. George visibly has no idea what the cop is
      talking about. The cop seems to be talking about nothing
      important, just chatting... He talks and talks... George
      doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand
      why he's talking to him. He's lost.

      Title card: What did you say?

      The cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. He thinks
      he's talking to a madman. He doesn't persist, merely sizes
      George up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop
      walks off. George, totally bewildered by the incident, seems
      to lose his grip on himself a little more.


115   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  115

      Peppy gets home in the evening, arms laden with flowers. She's
      happy.

      She quickly goes up the stairs and into George's bedroom. He's
      not there. She looks for him but can't find him. The maid says
      that he has left. She drops the flowers.


116   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           116

      George goes into his house that has been disfigured by the
      fire. The flames have changed everything and the atmosphere,
      here again, seems ghostly and sad.
                                                               39.


      George sits down in an armchair in the darkness. Jack sits down
      facing him. He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground.


117   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      117

      In the room with all the sheets, Peppy is with the maid. The
      maid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he
      removed all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable
      expression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible
      thought, she rushes outside.


118   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  118

      She runs out of the house and over to the car, but the
      chauffeur isn't there. She honks the horn to call him but
      there's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not
      wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the
      dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and
      pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she
      doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full
      speed - more or less successfully. Just as she passes through
      the gate, the chauffeur turns up. Too late. He sees her drive
      away.


119   EXT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                          119

      Peppy is driving as fast as she can through town, but she's
      pretty reckless and almost causes an accident.


120   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           120

      Outside George's house, the wind is slamming one of the
      shutters with the regularity of a metronome. George takes a
      gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box
      and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of
      him. He picks up the glass for another gulp. Jack doesn't like
      what he sees. He barks.

      (119) As for Peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring
      even the most basic of road safety requirements.

      (120) George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol.
      Jack isn't happy at all. He barks and bites George's trouser
      leg, pulling on it.

      (119) Peppy speeding along.

      (120) George puts the pistol into his mouth. Jack is barking
      like mad. George, still in the same position, closes his
      eyes.
                                                                40.


      Title card: "BANG!"

      George is in the same position. He still has the pistol in
      his mouth. Visibly, he's heard a BANG from outside, because
      he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the
      window.


121   EXT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            121

      Outside, we see Peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is
      still shuddering. Peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't
      care. She jumps out the car and runs into the house.


122   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            122

      She rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look
      at George. George awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind
      him. She bursts into tears.

      Title card: I feel so awful. I only wanted to help you. To
      take care of you...

      He seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got
      nothing to feel bad about. He opens his arms towards her,
      still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself.
      Fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes Peppy
      laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws
      herself into George's arms. They hug for a long time. Peppy
      says into his ear,

      Title card: You've got so much that no one else has...

      And into her ear, George replies:

      Title card: No, I'm nothing but a shadow. No good for
      anything but silence.

      Peppy doesn't reply. She just holds him tighter still and
      closes her eyes. Jack is sitting close by, watching them and
      wagging his tail.

      Outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still
      shuddering. Peppy opens her eyes. Visibly, she's had an idea.

      Jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. The shutter
      slams. The car shudders. Peppy smiles at George.

      Title card: I know what you have that no one else does.

      Peppy moves away from George and motions to him to listen.
      The shutter slams. Jacks tail thumps. The car shudders... Peppy
      does a few tap steps. George doesn't understand.
                                                               41.


      Peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his
      response. George does a few tap steps himself, basic ones,
      without any great enthusiasm. She smiles at him and does a
      few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. He smiles
      back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his
      feet. He looks at Peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his
      face.


123   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS (1931) - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY     123

      Music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in
      another decor. Except that from now on we actually hear the
      sound of the tap steps. We pull back to find Peppy and George
      in Zimmer's office. They're dancing for him. Little by little,
      Zimmer is convinced by them, and, when they finish their
      demonstration, he has a broad smile on his face.


124   INT. STUDIO - PEPPY & GEORGE - DAY                        124

      We find Peppy and George on a film set, still dancing. The
      piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now
      everyone wants to get up and dance! They are dancing a tap
      number facing the camera, in a décor representing a stylized
      New York. The choreography is incredible, in the grand style
      of the old Hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee
      slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on
      their faces. The music stops on a powerful blast from the
      brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy.
      In the ensuing silence, Peppy and George stay exactly where
      they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their
      faces. It goes on for a little too long, they are out of
      breath.

      Then they look at someone off-shot. They are facing a film
      crew (from their era of course). The director smiles. Zimmer,
      sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. The director speaks and
      we hear what he says.

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut! Excellent!

      Zimmer has both his thumbs up. The director says to Peppy and
      George.

                          DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                Once more? Please?

      George laughs and replies, and we hear him too.

                          GEORGE
                With pleasure!
                                                       42.


                           THE End

The credits run while Peppy and George go back to their
positions. The camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come
all the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair,
make-up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming
into position, the director coming over to say a few words to
the star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for
another take. And, when everyone is in position, the director
speaks into his megaphone and we hear "OK, Camera! Sound!
Rolling... and... Action!"

Fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the
credit sequence.

FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My father, who was well-known to the
	best circles in this kingdom under
	the name of roaring Harry James, was
	killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
	years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother, after her husband's
	death, and her retirement, lived in
	such a way as to defy slander.  She
	refused all offers of marriage,
	declaring that she lived now for her
	son only, and for the memory of her
	departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day.  But if she was
	proud of her beauty, to do her
	justice, she was still more proud of
	her son, and has said a thousand
	times to me that I was the
	handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The good soul's pleasure was to
	dress me; and on Sundays and
	Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
	coat with a silver-hilted sword by
	my side, and a gold garter at my
	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land.  As we walked to church on
	Sundays, even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My uncle's family consisted of ten
	children, and one of them was the
	cause of all my early troubles; this
	was the belle of the family, my
	cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  That first affair, how well one
	remembers it!  What a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one!  A lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private.  So it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
	instance, was always practicing, and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the exciseman, when he came
	his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the young apothecary's lad
	from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
	beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

			RODERICK
	I accept, but I insist on a wager.
	The loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases.

			DOROTHY
	Agreed.

			RODERICK
	Do you see the gate at the end of
	the field?  The first to touch it
	will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was certain to win, but I meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

			DOROTHY
	Your penalty is to find a cherry-
	colored ribbon which I have hidden
	somewhere on my person.  You are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will, and I will think very little
	of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

			RODERICK
	I feel the ribbon.

			DOROTHY
	Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

			DOROTHY
	Why are you shaking?

			RODERICK
	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	About this time, the United Kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a French invasion.  The noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders.  How I envied
	them.  The whole country was alive
	with war's alarums; the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music, while poor I was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I have endured torments in my life,
	but none like that.  Some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me, for I was the best
	dancer in the room, but I was too
	wretched, and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony.  I did
	not care for drink, or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days; but I thought of killing
	myself and Dorothy, and most
	certainly of making away with
	Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, and at morning, the ball
	was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

			DOROTHY
	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
	dear, and you'll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

			DOROTHY
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a
	pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
	were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
	throw me, you careless creature,
	you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

			RODERICK
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
	And I only danced with her because
	-- because -- the person with whom I
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night.

			DOROTHY
	I had not been in the room five
	minutes before I was engaged for
	every single set.

			RODERICK
	Were you obliged to dance five times
	with Captain Best, and then stroll
	out with him into the garden?

			DOROTHY
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
	he dances prettily to be sure, and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
	looks well in his regimentals, too;
	and if he chose to ask me to dance,
	how could I refuse him?

			RODERICK
	But you refused me, Dorothy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
	Best's a man, and you are only a
	boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
	world.

			RODERICK
	If ever I meet him again, you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two.  I'll fight him with sword or
	with pistol, captain as he is.

			DOROTHY
	But Captain Best is already known as
	a valiant soldier, and is famous as
	a man of fashion in London.  It is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers'
	boys, but to fight an Englishman is
	a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

			DOROTHY
	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
	such a hero, was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side.

			RODERICK
	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
	through them.

			DOROTHY
	What, with me on the pillion?  Would
	you kill poor me?

			RODERICK
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
	do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
	and swim you both across, where no
	enemy could follow us.

			DOROTHY
	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
	to do any such thing on Daisy.
	There's the captain's horse, Black
	George, I've heard say that Captain
	Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

			RODERICK
	Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I went home, and was ill speedily of
	a fever, which kept me to my bed for
	a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dorothy visited me only once, but I
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than I had been
	ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

			RODERICK
	Whose horse, fellow, is that?

			ORDERLY
	Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
	to my captain, and he's a better
	fellow nor you any day.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I did not stop to break his bones,
	as I would on another occasion, for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me, and I made for the garden as
	quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The fact is that, during the week of
	my illness, no other than Captain
	Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
	and making love to Miss Dorothy in
	form.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	No, Dorothy, except for you and four
	others, I vow before all the gods,
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame.

			DOROTHY
	Ah, you men, you men, John, your
	passion is not equal to ours.  We
	are like -- like some plant I've
	read of -- we bear but one flower,
	and then we die!

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another?

			DOROTHY
	Never, my John, but for thee!  How
	can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I pulled out a knot of cherry-
	colored ribbons, which she had given
	me out of her breast, and which
	somehow I always wore upon me, and
	flung them in Captain Best's face,
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn.

			RODERICK
	She's a liar -- she's a liar,
	Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
	yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

			DOROTHY
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
	spare the child -- he is but an
	infant.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	And ought to be whipped for his
	impudence, but never fear, Miss
	Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
	favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

			CAPTAIN BEST
	When ladies make presents to
	gentlemen, it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire...

			DOROTHY
	Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
	and don't signify any more than my
	parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

			RODERICK
		   (roaring)
	I'm a man, and will prove it.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
	many yards as you like.

			DOROTHY
	Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
	will!  Roddy, will you see me
	insulted?

			RODERICK
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
	have his blood as sure as my name's
	Roderick.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll send for the usher to cane you,
	little boy, but as for you, miss, I
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

			MICHAEL
	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
	matter here?

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
	I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
	and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
	to 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

			DOROTHY
		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (whisper to Dorothy)
	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (in a soothing tone
		    to Roderick)
	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

			RODERICK
		   (shouts after
		    Michael)
	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
	must first kill me -- do you mind
	that?

			MICHAEL
		   (shouting back from
		    a distance)
	Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
	you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
	huntsman to do it.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	You are a gallant lad, and I like
	your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
	true.  It's a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far-
	gone state as you; but, believe me,
	I know the world, and if you will
	but follow my advice, you won't
	regret having taken it.  Dorothy
	Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
	whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
	don't you see -- though it's a hard
	matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
	and does not care a pin for you or
	Best either?

			RODERICK
	Dorothy might love me or not, as she
	likes, but Best will have to fight
	me before he marries her!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Faith, I think you are a lad that's
	likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
	for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
	at three o'clock, which wakened me
	from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

			MAID
	The Englishman's still there, Master
	Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
	Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
	you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

			UNCLE
	Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
	That's right.

			AUNT
	He'd better be home with his mother.

			UNCLE
	Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast -- didn't
	agree with her.  Take a glass of
	spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
	health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

			UNCLE
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought
	with the captain!  See who'll be
	married first.  Jack Best, my dear
	boy, never mind a clean glass for
	the claret, we're short of crystal
	at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
	the wine will taste none the worse.
	Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
	please; this is a sort of toast that
	is drunk a great deal too seldom in
	my family, and you'll please to
	receive it with all the honors.
	Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
	Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
	her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
	you've got a treasure.

			RODERICK
		   (spring up)
	His already?!

			HARRY
	Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
	your tongue!

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	He has already been slapped in the
	face this morning, Captain John
	Best; he's already been called a
	coward, Captain John Best; and this
	is the way I'll drink his health.
	Here's your health, Captain John
	Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

			HARRY
	You fool!  You great blundering
	marplot -- you silly beggarly
	brat --
		   (a thump at each)
	Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

			UNCLE
	In Heaven's name, what does all the
	row mean?  Is the boy in fever
	again?

			HARRY
		   (turning to his
		    father)
	The fact is, sir, that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	Dorothy, and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today, he was for murdering Jack
	Best.

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (bristling up)
	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
	I've been insulted grossly in this
	house.  I ain't at all satisfied
	with these here ways of going on.
	I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
	of property; and I -- I --

			HARRY
	If you're insulted, and not
	satisfied, remember there's two of
	us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

			RODERICK
		   (in dignified tone)
	Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases, by calling on
	Roderick James, Esquire, of
	Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

			RODERICK
	Captain Grogan, I beg you to
	understand that, for my cousin
	Harry, who has been my best friend
	through life, I could put up with
	rough treatment from him; yet, even
	that sort of treatment I will bear
	from him no longer; and any other
	person who ventures on the like will
	not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
	that fact very well; and, if he's
	man, he'll know where to find me.

			UNCLE
	It is getting late, and your mother
	will be anxious about you.  One of
	you had better go home with him.
		   (turning to his sons)
	Or the lad may be playing more
	pranks.

			HARRY
	Both of us ride home with Best here.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
	man is armed, and so am I.

			HARRY
	You know the use of arms very well,
	Best, and no one can doubt your
	courage; but Michael and I will see
	you home for all that.

			UNCLE
	Why, you'll not be home till
	morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
	ten miles from here.

			HARRY
	We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
	We're going to stop a week there.
	And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A pretty day's work of it you have
	made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
	uncle to be distressed for money,
	and try and break off a match which
	will bring fifteen hundred a-year
	into the family?  Best has promised
	to pay off the four thousand pounds
	which is bothering your uncle so.
	He takes a girl without a penny -- a
	girl that has been flinging herself
	at the head of every man in these
	parts these ten years past, and
	missing them all, and a boy who
	ought to be attached to your uncle
	as to your father.

			RODERICK
	And so I am.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And this is the return you make for
	his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
	in his house when your father died,
	and hasn't he given you and your
	mother, rent-free, your fine house
	of Jamesville yonder?

			RODERICK
	Mark this, come what will of it, I
	swear I will fight the man who
	pretends to the hand of Dorothy
	Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
	the church, and meet him there.
	I'll have his blood, or he shall
	have mine.  Will you take my message
	to him, and arrange the meeting?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
	young fellow, you are the most
	bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
	officer, bearing His Majesty's
	commission, can receive a glass of
	wine on his nose, without resenting
	it -- fight you must, and Best is a
	huge, strong fellow.

			RODERICK
	He'll give the better mark.  I am
	not afraid of him.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	In faith, I believe you are not; for
	a lad I never saw more game in my
	life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
	You're after my own soul.  As long
	as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
	never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
	afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
	thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
	know what is in store for us, and
	that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In spite of my precautions to
	secrecy, I half-suspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival,
	and received our guest, Captain
	Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But she would not say a word about
	the quarrel, for she had a noble
	spirit, and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never slept sounder in my life,
	though I woke a little earlier than
	usual, and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day,
	for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And now I sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters; they might be the
	last, thought I, that I should ever
	write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then I went down to breakfast, where
	my mother was waiting for me, you
	may be sure.  We did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

			MOTHER
	Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  They have their faults, those
	mothers; but are there any other
	women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

			RODERICK
	Have you taken my message to him?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	The meeting is arranged.  Captain
	Best is waiting for you now.

			RODERICK
	My mare is saddled and ready; who's
	the captain's second?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
	The curtains of her bedroom-windows
	were down, and they didn't move as
	we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	That's a very handsome sword you
	have there.

			RODERICK
	It was with this sword that my late
	father, Harry James, God rest his
	soul, met Sir Huddelstone
	Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
	and was fatally run through the
	neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
	having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
	when in liquor, at the Brentford
	Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
	scorned to apologize.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And now you risk the same fate.  If
	you are killed, your mother is all
	alone in the world.

			RODERICK
	I am Harry James' son, and will act
	as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

			RODERICK
		   (to Captain Grogan)
	I hope to spoil this sport, and
	trust to see this sword of mine in
	that big bully's body.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
	are no match for Best with the
	sword.

			RODERICK
	I'll match any man with the sword.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	But swords are today impossible;
	Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
	knocked his knee against the
	swinging park gate last night, as he
	was riding home, and can scarce move
	it now.

			RODERICK
	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
	has been off the hinges these ten
	years.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I have just explained to Mister
	James that Captain Best is lame, and
	that swords are impossible.

			HARRY
	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

			HARRY
	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for
	he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
	he, Grogan?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
	the man who stood to Captain Best.

			HARRY
	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

			HARRY
		   (with a laugh to
		    Grogan)
	There's nothing else for it.  Take
	your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
	I suppose?

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (in a big voice)
	Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
	do you hear, Captain Grogan?

			HARRY
	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
	pistols.
		   (with some emotion
		    to Roderick)
	God bless you, my boy; and when I
	count three, fire.

			RODERICK
	This is not one of my pistols.

			HARRY
	They are all right, never fear.
	It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
	if they are needed, for the next
	round.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
	him there under the gorget; see how
	the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

			THE SECONDS
		   (crying out)
	He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

			MICHAEL
	He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

			HARRY
	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

			RODERICK
	It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

			RODERICK
	There!  Take her those ribbons.
	She'll know what they mean; that's
	all that's left of her of two lovers
	she had and ruined.

			MICHAEL
	And now, in Heaven's name, get the
	youngster out of the way.

			HARRY
	I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I need not tell you how great was my
	mother's pride and exultation when
	she heard from Harry's lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

			HARRY
	The boy must go into hiding, for a
	short time anyway.  Dublin is the
	best place for him to go, and there
	wait until matters are blown over.

			MOTHER
	Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
	been away from home.  He will be as
	safe here as in Dublin.

			HARRY
	I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
	but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure, in which
	argument, as I was anxious to see
	the world, I must confess, I sided
	with him; and my mother was brought
	to see that, in our small house, in
	the midst of a village, escape would
	be impossible, and capture would be
	impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

			MOTHER
		   (gravely)
	Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one.  I spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel, and
	all signs betoke a separation.  Here
	is twenty guineas -- all that I have
	in the world -- and I want you to
	keep your father's sword and
	pistols, which you have known to use
	so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She hurried my departure now, though
	her heart, I know, was full, and
	almost in half-an-hour from my
	arrival at home, I was once more on
	the road again, with the wide world,
	as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	No lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time, and
	twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
	rode away, thinking, I confess, not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone, and of the home behind me, as
	of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
	would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had no doubts of the future;
	thinking that a man of my person,
	parts, and courage, could make his
	way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
	to myself, or chatting with the
	passersby; and all the girls along
	the road said, "God save me, for a
	clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
	there seemed to be a gap of a half-
	a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Where are you bound for?

			RODERICK
		   (after a long look at
		    his companion)
	That is none of your business.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel?

			RODERICK
		   (pulling out a
		    pistol)
	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			FOOTMAN
	Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	O the coward!  To let the Captain
	bate you, and he only one eye!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #3
	The next time my lady travels, she'd
	better leave you at home!

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

			FOOTMAN
	Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	That fool didn't know what was the
	meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
	which was in the pocket-book that
	the fellow took from me.

			RODERICK
	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you, I shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	But I shouldn't like to put you to
	such trouble, Mister...?

			RODERICK
	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

			RODERICK
		   (very gallantly)
	As you have been robbed of your
	purse, may I have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home?

			MRS. O'REILLY
		   (smiling)
	That's very kind of you, Mr.
	O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
	assemblies.  In every sentence, she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality.  To the lady's question
	about my birth and parentage, I
	replied that I was a young gentleman
	of large fortune, that I was going
	to Dublin for my studies, and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	You must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in Dublin, where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound.
	I hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house,
	where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
	with delight, my gallant young
	preserver.

Paying the bill.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Perhaps had I been a little older in
	the world's experience, I should
	have begun to see that Madame
	O'Reilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be; but, as
	it was, I took all her stories for
	truth, and, when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner, paid it
	with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so we rode on slowly towards
	Dublin, into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
	and splendor of the coaches, the
	flare of the linkboys, the number
	and magnificence of the houses,
	struck me with the greatest wonder;
	though I was careful to disguise
	this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance, and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
	grateful I am for your timely
	assistance to my wife.

			RODERICK
	I am only sorry that I was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyship's money and
	pearls.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
	and rest assured, sir, you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in Dublin.
		   (pours a glass)
	Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
	your good father?

			RODERICK
	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
	of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
	was a close friend of my wife's dear
	father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

			RODERICK
	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
	are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	My love, I wish I had known of your
	coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty, which His Grace the Lord
	Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar.  You
	know the wine, my dear?  But as
	bygones are bygones, and no help for
	them, what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
	things from the table, and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
	don't seem to have any small change.
	May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
	give to the girl?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	I have some money, my dear.  Here,
	Betty, go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper, and mind you
	get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our supper was seasoned, if not by
	any great elegance, at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes,
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city, with whom, according to
	himself, the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
	behind hand with him, I spoke of my
	own estates and property as if I was
	as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Had I been an English lad, the
	appearance of the chamber I occupied
	might, indeed, have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust.
	But we are not particular in Ireland
	on the score of neatness, hence the
	disorder of my bed-chamber did not
	strike me so much.

Broken door.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was there a lock to the door, or a
	hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
	O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And my cracked toilet-glass not much
	bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
	used to these sort of ways in Irish
	houses, and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was no lock to the drawers,
	which, when they did open, were full
	of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
	stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I needn't ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed.  Young Fred
	Pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months, during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me, and if he was
	satisfied, I don't know who else
	wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After breakfast, we drove out to
	Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to Mrs.
	O'Reilly, to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that, before half an hour, I had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had little notion then that I had
	got amongst a set of impostors --
	that Captain O'Reilly was only an
	adventurer, and his lady a person of
	no credit.  The fact was, a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which I
	now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which, you
	may be sure, that cards were not
	wanting, and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company?  And in a very, very
	short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

			RODERICK
	I shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

			COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
	Master Roderick, you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune; let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
	regular gang of swindlers; and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company.  The captain has been a
	gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
	of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
	your valise, pay the little trifle
	you owe me, mount your mare, and
	ride back again to your parents --
	it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Into a pretty nest of villains,
	indeed, was I plunged!  When I
	returned to my bed-chamber, a few
	hours later, it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Whom have I been harboring in my
	house?  Who are you, sirrah?

			RODERICK
	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
	gentleman as any in Ireland!

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	You're an impostor, young man, a
	schemer, a deceiver!

			RODERICK
	Repeat the words again, and I run
	you through the body.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
	well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
	Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
	secret is known, is it?  You come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families; you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis; I take
	you to my tradesmen, who give you
	credit.  I accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds, and what do I
	find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
	but Roderick James of the devil only
	knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
	you why I was obliged to alter my
	name, which is James and the best
	name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
	because, on the day before I came to
	Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
	combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
	Captain in His Majesty's service;
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way, the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
	O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
	child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
	Heaven's name, let him go.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
		   (sulkily)
	He may go hang for me, and he's
	better be off quickly, for I shall
	go to the magistrate if I see him
	again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Where was now a home for the
	descendant of the James?  I was
	expelled from Dublin by a
	persecution occasioned, I must
	confess, by my own imprudence.  I
	had no time to wait and choose.  No
	place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

			RODERICK
	I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
	a young gentleman in difficulties; I
	have killed an officer in a duel,
	and I am anxious to get out of the
	country.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I needn't have troubled myself
	with any explanations; King George
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came -- and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
	chosen my time better.  A transport
	was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
	wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company, and hate all
	descriptions of low life.  Hence my
	account of the society in which I at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short.  The
	reminiscences of the horrid black-
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined, of the wretched
	creatures with whom I was now forced
	to keep company, of the plowmen,
	poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
	refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
	in truth, I had done myself, is
	enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

			RODERICK
	Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

			MR. TOOLE
	Get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands, and serve him a basin of
	turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	If you want to vex him, ask him
	about his wife, the washerwoman, who
	bates him.

			RODERICK
	Is it a towel of your wife's
	washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
	wiped your face often with one.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	Ask him why he wouldn't see her
	yesterday, when she came to the
	ship.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so I put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
	pecking, and flat-irons, which set
	the man into a fury, and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	This victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom I
	formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our passage was very favorable, and
	in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
	and before I had been a month in the
	Electorate, I was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier, and,
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise, was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	There's only six Miss Dugans now...
	poor Dorothy.

			RODERICK
	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
	died of grief?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	She took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband.  She is now
	Mrs. John Best.

			RODERICK
	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
	Mr. John Best?!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	No, the very same one, my boy.  He
	recovered from his wound.  The ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
	Do you think the Dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
	of the family?  The plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way, for the cowardly
	Englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you.  But hit him
	you certainly did, Roderick, and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow,
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to.
	We told your mother the story
	afterwards, and a pretty scene she
	made.

			RODERICK
	The coward!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	He has paid off your uncle's
	mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
	and-six.  That coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncle's
	family.  Faith, the business was
	well done.  Your cousins, Michael
	and Harry, never let him out of
	their sight, though he was for
	deserting to England, until the
	marriage was completed, and the
	happy couple off on their road to
	Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
	boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
	a couple of hundred out of Master
	Best for my share and, while they
	last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our regiment, which was quartered
	about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the Rhine, where we would
	fight the famous battle of Minden.
	It would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than I am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	Seven Years' War in which Europe was
	engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated, and the books written
	about it so amazingly hard to
	understand, that I have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning, and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal
	disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Were these memoirs not characterized
	by truth, I might easily make myself
	the hero of some strange and popular
	adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I saw no one of the higher ranks
	that day than my colonel and a
	couple of orderly officers riding by
	in the smoke -- no one on our side,
	that is.  A poor corporal is not
	generally invited into the company
	of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
	you, some very good company on the
	French part, for their regiments of
	Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
	charging us all day; and in the sort
	of melee high and low are pretty
	equally received.  I hate bragging,
	but I cannot help saying that I made
	a very close acquaintance with the
	colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And finished off a poor little
	ensign, so young, slender, and
	small, that a blow from my pigtail
	would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And in the poor ensign's pocket
	found a purse of fourteen louis
	d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
	plums, of which the former present
	was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If people would tell their stories
	of battles in this simple way, I
	think the cause of truth would not
	suffer by it.  All I know of this
	famous fight of Minden, except from
	books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

			CAPTAIN
	Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
	your company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	That was all the epitaph my brave
	patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I should have left you a hundred
	guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
	run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When we came back to our ground,
	which we presently did, he was lying
	still, but he was dead.  Some of our
	people had already torn off his
	epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
	his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After the death of my protector,
	Captain Grogan, I am forced to
	confess that I fell into the very
	worst of courses and company.  In a
	foreign country, with the enemy
	before us, and the people
	continually under contribution from
	one side or the other, numberless
	irregularities were permitted to the
	troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
	talk of the age of chivalry; but
	remember the starving brutes whom
	they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
	entirely ignorant, made to take
	pride in deeds of blood -- men who
	can have no amusement but in
	drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
	It is with these shocking
	instruments that your great warriors
	and kings have been doing their
	murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The year in which George II died,
	our regiment had the honor to be
	present at the Battle of Warburg,
	where Prince Ferdinand once more
	completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	During the action, my lieutenant,
	Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
	struck by a musket-ball in the side.
	He had shown no want of courage in
	this or any other occasion where he
	had been called upon to act against
	the French; but this was his first
	wound, and the young gentleman was
	exceedingly frightened by it.

			LAKENHAM
	Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
	pay you five guineas if you will
	carry me into the town which is hard
	by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We put the patient to bed, and he
	paid me the stipulated reward.  A
	young surgeon, who desired nothing
	better than to take himself out of
	the fire of the musketry, came
	presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

			PRIVATE
	I should get half.

			RODERICK
	Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

			PRIVATE
	He gave you five guineas, and I
	bloody well expect half.

			RODERICK
	Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

			LAKENHAM
		   (languidly, in pain)
	Who are you putting into that bed?

			LISCHEN
	We have the Corporal, wounded, to
	you bringing.

			LAKENHAM
	A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
	sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I found Lischen the tenderest of
	nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
	to be provided for the wounded
	lieutenant, a share was always sent
	to the bed opposite his, and to the
	avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor was I the only person in the
	house to whom the worthy gentleman
	was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
	Lischen hither and thither, made
	impertinent love to her, abused her
	soups, quarreled with her
	omelettes, and grudged the money
	which was laid out for his
	maintenance, so that our hostess
	detested him as much as, I think,
	without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For if truth must be told, I had
	made very deep love to her during my
	stay under her roof, as is always my
	way with women, of whatever age or
	degree of beauty.  Do not think me
	very cruel and heartless, ladies;
	this heart of Lischen's was like
	many a town, which had been stormed
	and occupied several times before I
	came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I began to reflect how pleasant my
	quarters were to me, and that I was
	much better here than crawling under
	an odious tent with a parcel of
	tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
	rounds, or rising long before
	daybreak for drill.  I determined
	that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

			RODERICK
	I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
	to take my leave of you.  I intend
	to have your papers and purse.

			LAKENHAM
	You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
	dog!  What do you mean by dressing
	yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
	as my name's Lakenham, when we get
	back to the regiment, I'll have your
	soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
	are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My companion treated me with great
	civility, and asked me a thousand
	questions about England, which I
	answered as best I might.  But this
	best, I am bound to say, was bad
	enough.  I knew nothing about
	England, and I invented a thousand
	stories which I told him; described
	the king and the ministers to him,
	said the British ambassador in
	Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
	acquaintance a letter of
	recommendation to him.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What is your uncle's name?

			RODERICK
		   (slowly)
	O'Grady.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (with a laugh)
	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
	O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It hurts my feelings to be obliged
	to commune with such wretches, but
	the stern necessities of war demand
	men continually, and hence these
	recruiters whom you see market in
	human flesh.  They get five-and-
	twenty thaler a man from our
	government for every man they bring
	in.  For fine men -- for men like
	you.
		   (he adds laughing)
	They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	This is a very good inn.  Shall we
	stop for dinner?

			RODERICK
	This may be a very good inn for
	Germany, but it would not pass in
	old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
	league off, let us push on for
	Corbach.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Do you want to see the loveliest
	woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
	influence you.

			RODERICK
	The place seems more a farm than an
	inn-yard.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The people are great farmers, as
	well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (explaining the gate)
	Parties of French horsemen are about
	the country, and one cannot take too
	many precautions against such
	villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
	a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (when she leaves)
	Where's the beauty you promised me?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (laughing and looking
		    hard at Roderick)
	It was my joke.  I was tired, and
	did not care to go farther.  There's
	not prettier woman here than that.
	If she won't suit your fancy, my
	friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (sternly)
	Upon my word, sir, I think you have
	acted very coolly.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I have acted as I think fit.

			RODERICK
	Sir, I'm a British officer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
	You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
	and folly have confirmed this to me.
	You pretend to carry dispatches to a
	general who has been dead these ten
	months; you have an uncle who is an
	ambassador and whose name you don't
	know.  Will you join and take the
	bounty, sir, or will you be given
	up?

			RODERICK
	Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Advance a step, and I send this
	bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

			RODERICK
	I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the close of the Seven Years' War,
	the Prussian army, so renowned for
	its disciplined valor, was
	officered and under-officered by
	native Prussians, it is true, but
	was composed for the most part of
	men hired or stolen, like myself,
	from almost every nation in Europe.
	The deserting to and fro was
	prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life the private soldier led was
	a frightful one to any but the men
	of iron courage and endurance.  The
	punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was not near so unhappy, in spite
	of all, as I had been on my first
	enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
	there will be no one of my
	acquaintance who will witness my
	shame, and that is the point which I
	have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
	you are caught, there is no use in
	repining -- make the best of your
	situation, and get all the pleasure
	you can out of it.  There are a
	thousand opportunities of plunder,
	offered to the soldier in war time,
	out of which he can get both
	pleasure and profit; make use of
	these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I do not intend to make a history of
	battles in the Prussian any more
	than in the English service.  I did
	my duty in them as well as another,
	and there was not a braver,
	cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
	own, wickeder soldier in the
	Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

			RODERICK
	I had formed myself to the condition
	of the proper fighting beast; on a
	day of action, I was savage and
	happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

			COLONEL BULOW
	You are a gallant soldier, and have
	evidently come of good stock; but
	you are idle, dissolute, and
	unprincipled; you have done a deal
	of harm to the men; and, for all
	your talents and bravery, I am sure
	you will come to no good.

			RODERICK
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
	regarding my character.  I have
	fallen into bad company, it is true;
	but I have only done as other
	soldiers have done; and, above all,
	I have never had a kind friend and
	protector before, to whom I might
	show that I was worthy of better
	things.  The Colonel may say I am a
	ruined lad, and send me to the
	devil; but be sure of this, I would
	go to the devil to serve the
	regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Soon after the war ended, our
	regiment was garrisoned in the
	capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
	all the towns of Prussia; but that
	does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

			RODERICK
	Private Roderick James.  First
	Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
	Galgenstein sent for me.

			PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
	You may wait.

			RODERICK
	Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

			PRIVATE
	Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
	the Captain's furniture, but the
	driver says he is not supposed to
	unload it.  Is it possible for you
	to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
	Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
	You are a model of probity!  You'll
	never succeed to my place, my dear
	nephew, if you are no wiser than you
	are just now.  Make the fellow as
	useful to you as you please.  You
	say he has a good manner and a frank
	countenance, that he can lie with
	assurance, and fight, you say, on a
	pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
	for good qualities.  As long as you
	have the regiment in terrorem over
	him, you can do as you like with
	him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
	is likely to give you the slip.
	Keep on promising him; promise to
	make him a general, if you like.
	What the deuce do I care?  There are
	spies enough to be had in this town
	without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Good morning, Private James.  Please
	come in.  I should like you to meet
	my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
	Galgenstein.

			RODERICK
	How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The captain was the nephew and heir
	of the Minister of Police, Herr
	Galgenstein, a relationship which,
	no doubt, aided in the younger
	gentlemen's promotion.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well -- and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us; if you
	succeed, depend on it, your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

			RODERICK
	What is the service, sir?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	There is lately come to Berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	Empress Queen, who calls himself the
	Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	pope's order of the Spur.  He is
	made for good society, polished,
	obliging, a libertine, without
	prejudices, fond of women, of good
	food, of high play, prudent and
	discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	He speaks Italian and French
	indifferently; but we have some
	reason to fancy this Monsieur de
	Belle Fast is a native of your
	country of Ireland, and that he has
	come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Naturally, your knowledge of English
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service.  Of course, you will
	not know a word of English; and if
	the Chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent, say
	you are Hungarian.  The servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today, and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you.

Roderick nods.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You are a Hungarian; you served in
	the army, and left on account of
	weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
	great deal, and wins.  Do you know
	the cards well?

			RODERICK
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I had thought you more expert.  You
	must find out if the Chevalier
	cheats.  He sees the English and
	Austrian envoys continually, and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house.  Find out
	what they talk of, for how much each
	plays, especially if any of them
	play on parole.  If you are able to,
	read his private letters, though
	about those which go to the post,
	you need not trouble yourself -- we
	look at them there.  But never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes, and by what channel
	or messenger.  He sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatch-box with a
	string around his neck -- twenty
	frederics, if you get an impression
	of the keys.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Does this assignment interest you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, Minister, I am interested in
	any work in which I can be of
	service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	You are the young man who M. de
	Seebach recommended?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

			CHEVALIER
	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.

			CHEVALIER
	You come highly recommended by Herr
	Seebach.

			RODERICK
	Herr Seebach was a very kind
	employer.

			CHEVALIER
	For whom else have you worked?

			RODERICK
	No one, sir.  Before that I served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins.

			CHEVALIER
	Who else can give me information
	about you?

			RODERICK
	Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

			CHEVALIER
	You will do.  I will give you 30...
	a day.  I do not provide your
	clothing; you will sleep at home,
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

			CHEVALIER
	Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was very imprudent of me; but
	when I saw the splendor of his
	appearance, the nobleness of his
	manner, I felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him.  You, who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity; and there's a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

			RODERICK
		   (as he speaks,
		    bursting into tears)
	Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
	am an Irishman, and my name is
	Roderick James.  I was abducted into
	the Prussian army two years ago, and
	now I have been put into your
	service by my Captain and his uncle,
	the Minister of Police, to serve as
	a watch upon your actions, of which
	I am to give information to the same
	quarter.  For this odious service, I
	have been promised my discharge, and
	a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

			CHEVALIER
	The rascals!  They think to catch
	me, do they?  Why, young man, my
	chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
	But the king is so jealous, that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital, in
	the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And I think he was as much affected
	as I was at thus finding one of his
	kindred; for he, too, was an exile
	from home, and a friendly voice, a
	look, brought the old country back
	to his memory again, and the old
	days of his boyhood.

			CHEVALIER
	I'd give five years of my life to
	see the old country again, the
	greenfields, and the river, and the
	old round tower, and the burying
	place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			CHEVALIER
	My lad, I have been in every
	service; and, between ourselves, owe
	money in every capital in Europe.  I
	have been a rolling stone.  Play --
	play has been my ruin!  That and
	beauty.  The women have made a fool
	of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
	hearted creature, and this minute,
	at sixty-two, have no more command
	of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
	made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

			CHEVALIER
	The cards are now my only
	livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
	and then I lay out my money in these
	trinkets you see.  It's property,
	look you, and the only way I have
	found of keeping a little about me.
	When the luck goes against me, why,
	my dear, my diamonds go to the
	pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
	you understand the cards?

			RODERICK
	I can play as soldiers do, but have
	no great skill.

			CHEVALIER
	We will practice in the mornings, my
	boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
	or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I carried my little reports to
	Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous.  These reports, of
	course, were arranged between me and
	the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
	instructed, and it is always the
	best way, to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

			RODERICK
	He goes to church regularly -- he is
	very religious, and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner, which is served at
	noon.  After dinner, he writes his
	letters, if he has any letters to
	write; but he has very little to do
	in this way.  His letters are to the
	Austrian envoy, with whom he
	corresponds, but who does not
	acknowledge him; and being written
	in English, or course, I look over
	his shoulder.  He generally writes
	for money.  He makes his party with
	Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
	the Russian attaches, two from the
	English embassy, my lords Deuceace
	and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
	and a few more.  He wins often, but
	not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
	fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
	the English Minister, sometimes
	comes, on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was agreed that I should keep my
	character of valet, that in the
	presence of strangers I should not
	know a word of English, that I
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when I was serving the
	champagne and punch about; and,
	having a remarkably fine eyesight,
	and a great natural aptitude, I was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Simplicity was our secret.
	Everything successful is simple.
	If, for instance, I wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin, it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
	ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
	wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
	If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
	blew my nose, it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary; and then,
	I warrant you, some pretty trials of
	skill would take place.  The Prince
	of Turbingen, although so young, had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way; and it
	was only from hearing Ritter von
	Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
	three times when the Chevalier had
	the ace of trumps, that I knew we
	were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
	I believe you have cheated me.

			CHEVALIER
	I deny your Grace's accusations, and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated?

			PRINCE
		   (glaring at Roderick)
	I don't know.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics, which I have honorably
	won.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, if you will have your
	money now, you must fight for it.
	If you will be patient, maybe I will
	pay you something another time.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
	take this, then I must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation.

			PRINCE
	I have said all there is to be said.
	I am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Was he cheated?

			RODERICK
	In so far as I can tell these things
	-- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
	the money fairly.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Hmm-mmmm.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What are the Chevalier's intentions?

			RODERICK
	I am not sure.  The Prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money, he would have to
	fight for it.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	A meeting with the Prince of
	Turbingen is impossible.

			RODERICK
	The Prince left him only that
	choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	Tell them I intend to demand
	satisfaction from the Prince.

			RODERICK
	But they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost.

			CHEVALIER
	Have no fear.  It will come out well
	for me.

			RODERICK
	I believe they will deport you.

			CHEVALIER
	I have faced that problem before.

			RODERICK
	But, if they send you away, then
	what is to become of me?

			CHEVALIER
		   (with a smile)
	Make your mind easy, you shall not
	be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
	take a last look at your barracks,
	make your mind easy, say a farewell
	to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
	souls, how they will weep when they
	hear you are out of the country,
	and, out of it, you shall go.

			RODERICK
	But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	The King has determined to send the
	Chevalier out of the country.

			RODERICK
	When is he to go?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Has he sent the challenge yet?

			RODERICK
	Not yet, but I believe he intends
	to.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Then this must be done tomorrow.

			RODERICK
	What is to be done?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You say he drives after breakfast
	and before dinner.  When he comes
	out to his carriage a couple of
	gendarmes will mount the box, and
	the coachman will get his orders to
	move on.

			RODERICK
	And his baggage?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
	have a fancy to look into that red
	box which contains his papers, you
	say; and at noon, after parade,
	shall be at the inn.  You will not
	say a word to any one there
	regarding the affair, and will wait
	for me at the Chevalier's rooms
	until my arrival.  We must force
	that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
	or you would have got the key long
	ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At ten o'clock the next morning, the
	carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
	Fast drew up as usual at the door of
	his hotel, and the Chevalier came
	down the stairs in his usual stately
	manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (standing by the
		    carriage)
	I will let down the steps for your
	honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

			CHEVALIER
	Good gracious!  What is this?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (touching his hat)
	You are going to drive to the
	frontier.

			CHEVALIER
	It is shameful -- infamous!  I
	insist upon being put down at the
	Austrian ambassador's house.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	I have orders to gag your honor if
	you cry out, and to give you this
	purse containing ten thousand
	frederics if you do not.

			CHEVALIER
	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
	owes me seventy thousand.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Your honor must lower his voice.

			CHEVALIER
		   (whispering)
	All Europe shall hear of this!

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
	only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Hearing the sound of the alarm
	cannon, the common people came out
	along the road, with fowling-pieces
	and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
	the truant.  The gendarmes looked
	very anxious to be on the lookout
	for him too.  The price of a
	deserter was fifty crowns to those
	who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

			CHEVALIER
	I have no luggage.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	The gentleman has nothing
	contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

			CHEVALIER
	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
	Will you please go to the house from
	whence we set out this morning, and
	tell my man there to send my baggage
	on to Three Kings at Dresden?

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then ordering fresh horses, the
	Chevalier set off on his journey for
	that capital.  I need not tell you
	that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
	Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
	Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
	Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
	Roderick -- This comes to you by a
	sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
	of the English mission, who is
	acquainted, as all Berlin will be
	directly, with our wonderful story.
	They only know half as yet; they
	only know that a deserter went off
	in my clothes, and all are in
	admiration of your cleverness and
	valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	As I lay in my bed two and a half
	hours after your departure, in comes
	your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (in his imperious
		    Dutch manner)
	Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Straightaway he makes for the red
	box where I keep my love letters, my
	glass eye which I used to wear, my
	two sets of Paris teeth, and my
	other private matters that you know
	of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
	but none of them fit the English
	lock.  Then he takes out of his
	pocket a chisel and hammer, and
	falls to work like a professional
	burglar, actually bursting open the
	little box!  Now was my time to act!
	I advance towards him armed with an
	immense water-jug.  I come
	noiselessly up to him just as he has
	broken the box, and, with all my
	might, I deal him such a blow over
	the head as smashes the water-jug to
	bits, and sends the captain with a
	snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
	I ring all the bells in the house;
	and shout, and swear, and scream,
	"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
	-- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
	household comes tumbling up the
	stairs.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my servant?  Who dares to
	rob me in open day?  Look at the
	villain whom I find in the act of
	breaking my chest open!  Send for
	the police, send for his Excellency
	the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
	shall know of this insult!

			LANDLORD
	Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
	three hours ago.

			CHEVALIER
	Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
	all morning.  I am ill -- I have
	taken physic -- I have not left the
	house this morning!  Where is that
	scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
	are my clothes and wig?

			CHAMBERMAID
	I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
	off in your honor's dress.

			CHEVALIER
	And my money -- my money!  Where is
	my purse with forty-eight frederics
	in it?  But we have one of the
	villains left, Officers, seize him.

			LANDLORD
		   (more and more
		    astonished)
	It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

			CHEVALIER
	What!  A gentleman breaking open my
	trunk with hammer and chisel --
	impossible!

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Herr Galgenstein was returning to
	life by this time, with a swelling
	on his skull as big as a saucepan;
	and the officers carried him off,
	and, to make a long story short,
	poor Galgenstein is now on his way
	to Spandau; and his uncle, the
	Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
	brought me five hundred louis, with
	a humble request that I would leave
	Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
	painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
	particularly good order with the
	Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
	was, at this period, the most
	brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He spent fabulous sums on the
	ballets and operas.  All the
	ballerinas were pretty, and they all
	boasted that they had all at least
	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the
	beautiful talk to us.  There was no
	man in Europe more gay in spirits,
	more splendid in personal
	accomplishment, than young Roderick
	James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What a delightful life did we now
	lead!  I knew I was born a
	gentleman, from the kindly way in
	which I took to the business, as
	business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at
	play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I
	had never done anything else all my
	life.  I had a gentleman to wait
	upon me, a French friseur to dress
	my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I knew the taste of chocolate as by
	intuition almost, and could
	distinguish between the right
	Spanish and the French before I had
	been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had rings on my fingers, watches
	in both my fobs, trinkets, and
	snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
	outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had the finest natural taste for
	lace and china of any man I ever
	knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I could judge a horse as well as any
	dealer in Germany.  I could not
	spell, but I could speak German and
	French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had at least twelve suits of
	clothes; three richly embroidered
	with gold, two laced with silver;
	one of French grey, silver-laced and
	lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
	morning robes, to which a peacock's
	tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
	skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I took lessons on the guitar, and
	sang French catches exquisitely.
	Where, in fact, was there a more
	accomplished gentleman than Roderick
	James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How have we had the best blood, and
	the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
	throbbing round the table as I and
	the Chevalier have held the cards
	and the bank against some terrible
	player, who was matching some
	thousands out of his millions
	against our all which was there on
	the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our principles were:  play grandly,
	honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
	down at losing; but, above all, be
	not eager at winning, as mean souls
	are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When the Duke of Courland brought
	fourteen lackeys each with bags of
	florins, and challenged our bank to
	play against the sealed bags, what
	did we ask?

			CHEVALIER
	Sir, we have but eighty thousand
	florins in bank, or two hundred
	thousand at three months; if your
	highness' bags do not contain more
	than eight thousand, we will meet
	you.

Playing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we did, and after eleven hours
	play, in which our bank was at one
	time reduced to two hundred and
	three ducats, we won seventeen
	thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor need I mention my successes
	among the fairer portion of the
	creation.  One of the most
	accomplished, the tallest, the most
	athletic, and the handsomest
	gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
	a young fellow of my figure could
	not fail of having advantages, which
	a person of my spirit knew very well
	how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dark Valdez.

			RODERICK
	Do you expect me to believe that
	your lover brought you here tonight?

			VALDEZ
	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
	and he will call for me at midnight.

			RODERICK
	And he doesn't care about me?

			VALDEZ
	He is only curious to know who you
	are.

			RODERICK
	If his love were like mine, he would
	not permit you to come here.

			VALDEZ
	He loves me, as I love you.

			RODERICK
	Will he wish to know the details of
	this night?

			VALDEZ
	He will believe that it will please
	me if he asks about it, and I shall
	tell him everything except some
	circumstances which might humiliate
	him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

			LANGEAC
	I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

			LANGEAC
	There you are, dressed by my hand.
	It is nearly the same thing; but
	despite the fineness and
	transparency of the skin, the little
	fellow pleases me less well in
	costume.  It seems that this
	covering degrades him, or degrades
	me -- one of the other.

			RODERICK
	Both, my angel.  It was Love who
	invented these little jackets:  for
	he had to ally himself with
	Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

			COUNT
	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
	moment for you; it seems that you
	love this lady.

			RODERICK
	Certainly, monseigneur, does not
	Your Excellency consider her worthy
	of love?

			COUNT
	Perfectly so; and what is more, I
	will tell you that I love her, and
	that I am not of a humor to put up
	with rivals.

			RODERICK
	Very well!  Now that I know it, I
	will no longer love her.

			COUNT
	Then you yield to me.

			RODERICK
	On the instant.  Everyone must yield
	to such a nobleman as you.

			COUNT
	Very well; but a man who yields
	takes to his legs.

			RODERICK
	That is a trifle strong.

			COUNT
	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

			RODERICK
	Your Excellency has wantonly
	insulted me.  That being so, I
	conclude that you hate me,
	Monseigneur, and that hence you
	would be glad to remove me from the
	number of the living.  In this wish,
	I can and will satisfy Your
	Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol, and readiness to
	use them, that maintained the
	reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

			DASCHER
	I see that you are without your
	sword, but I believe you are a man
	of mettle.  Will you give me
	satisfaction?

			RODERICK
	I shall be delighted; but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet, for, after all, you
	cannot pay me when you are dead.

			ANOTHER OFFICER
	I will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis, but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

			DASCHER
	I may have been mistaken, but I mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

			RODERICK
		   (privately)
	It is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel -- that should be work for
	a hangman.

			CHEVALIER
	To risk one's life against such
	people is an imposition.

			RODERICK
		   (laughs)
	I risk nothing, for I am certain to
	kill him.

			CHEVALIER
	Certain?

			RODERICK
	Perfectly certain, because I shall
	make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

			RODERICK
	You have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference, and fire
	first.  The space between these two
	trees is the place where I choose to
	walk back and forth.  You may walk
	too, if you wish, when it is my turn
	to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

			DASCHER
	But we must decide who is to have
	the first shot.

			RODERICK
	There is no need of that.  I never
	fire first; and, in any case, you
	have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

			RODERICK
		   (with the greatest
		    composure)
	You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
	would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Thus is will be seen that our life,
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger,
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success, and sudden and
	unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

			RODERICK
	I am posting, monsieur, and
	furthermore I am a foreigner.

			STRANGER
	Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
	has no special right, and if you are
	a foreigner, you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine,
	since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The ladies were passionately fond of
	play, and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us; for the truth
	most be told, that the ladies loved
	to play, but not to pay.  The point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex; and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table, could get
	their money if they lost or, if they
	paid, prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	On this evening, the lady of high
	rank, after I had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
	sent her lover with a band of cut-
	throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
	Countess and a Viscountess in her
	own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the wife of her cousin, the
	Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
	Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
	Minister to George II and George III
	of several of the smaller courts of
	Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the mother to Viscount
	Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
	little boy, about whom his father
	was more than indifferent, and whom
	his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I made Sir William Cosgrove's
	acquaintance as usual at the play-
	table.  One could not but admire the
	spirit and gallantry with which he
	pursued his favorite pastime; for,
	though worn out with gout and a
	myriad of diseases, a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair, and
	suffering pangs of agony, yet you
	would see him every morning, and
	every evening at his post behind the
	delightful green cloth.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
	have no more manners than a barber,
	and I think my black footman has
	been better educated than you; but
	you are a young fellow of
	originality and pluck, and I like
	you, sir.  because you seem
	determined to go to the devil by a
	way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

			RODERICK
	I am obliged to observe, Sir William
	Cosgrove, that since you are bound
	for the next world much sooner than
	I am, I will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me.

Laughter.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
	me.  Marriage has added forty years
	to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
	cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
	I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself.  Fool that I was!
	I had enough with my pensions,
	perfect freedom, the best society in
	Europe -- and I gave up all these,
	and married and was miserable.  Take
	a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
	stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
	but marry.

			RODERICK
	Would you have me spend my life all
	alone?

			SIR WILLIAM
	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
	marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

			RODERICK
		   (laughing)
	The milkmaid's daughter?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
	No man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wife's sake; on
	the contrary, if he selects the
	animal properly, he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance.  For instance, I have
	got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power.  My wife never comes near
	me.  What friend have I?  None in
	the wide world.  Men of the world,
	as you and I are, don't make
	friends, and we are fools for our
	pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

			SIR WILLIAM
	My lady is a weak woman, but she is
	my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in Christendom.  She is
	enormously rich, but somehow I have
	never been so poor, as since I
	married her.  I thought to better
	myself, and she has made me
	miserable and killed me, and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

			RODERICK
	Has her ladyship a very large
	income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite my friend's strong warning.
	I resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
	dying.  His widow would be a rich
	prize.  Why should I not win her,
	and, with her, the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired?
	When I determine, I look upon the
	thing as done.

			RODERICK
	Charming lady, tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude.  Have you a
	lover?

The countess laughs.

			COUNTESS
	No.

			RODERICK
	Have you had one?

			COUNTESS
	Never.

			RODERICK
	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

			COUNTESS
	Not even that.

			RODERICK
	How can I believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you?

			COUNTESS
	Not one.

			RODERICK
	Have you not a man whom you value?

			COUNTESS
	That man has, perhaps, not yet been
	born.

			RODERICK
	What!  You have not met a man worthy
	of your attention?

			COUNTESS
	Many worthy of attention; but
	valuing is something more.  I could
	value only someone whom I loved.

			RODERICK
	Then you have never loved?  Your
	heart is empty.

			COUNTESS
	Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
	Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
	it is fortunate, I congratulate
	myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
	not care, for I am not aware of it.

			RODERICK
	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
	you will know it when you love.

			COUNTESS
	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune.

			RODERICK
	That is true, but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love.

			COUNTESS
	It is only too possible.  Love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult, and it is even more
	difficult to make it last.

			RODERICK
	I agree; but God put us on earth to
	take that risk.

			COUNTESS
	A man may need to do that, and find
	it amusing; but a girl is bound by
	other laws.

			RODERICK
	I believe you, and I see I must
	hasten to leave, for otherwise I
	shall become the unhappiest of men.

			COUNTESS
	How so?

			RODERICK
	By loving you, with no hope of
	possessing you.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	You want my heart?

			RODERICK
	It is my only object.

			COUNTESS
	To make me wretched in two weeks.

			RODERICK
	To love you until death.  To
	subscribe to all your commands.

			COUNTESS
	The amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing, if it is
	true that you love me.

			RODERICK
	Deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me.  If I do
	not know it, I am innocent.

			COUNTESS
	But you deceive me nonetheless if I
	believe you, for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

			COUNTESS
	Be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are?

			RODERICK
	With a woman who is completely
	charming, be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition, and
	who, regardless of her rank, will
	show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	And if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness?

			RODERICK
	Then I will respectfully take leave
	of her.

			COUNTESS
	You will do as you please.  It seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other.  Do you not agree?

			RODERICK
	Yes -- but I am afraid of being
	deceived.

			COUNTESS
	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
	want to begin where people end?

			RODERICK
	I ask only a payment on account
	today -- after that, you will find
	me undemanding, obedient and
	discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

			RODERICK
	Will we always leave it at this?

			COUNTESS
	Always, my dear one, never any
	further.  Love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles.  A full diet
	can only kill it.

			RODERICK
	I know better than you do.  Love
	wants a more substantial fare, and
	if it is stubbornly withheld, it
	withers away.

			COUNTESS
	Our abstinence makes our love
	immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago, now I should love
	you even more.  But I should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires.

			RODERICK
	Let us give each other complete
	happiness, and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires, they will each time be born
	anew.

			COUNTESS
	My husband has convinced me of the
	contrary.

			RODERICK
	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
	dying, and yet I envy him more than
	any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
	privilege of which I am deprived.
	He may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases, and no veil keeps his
	senses, his eyes, his soul from
	enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

			COUNTESS
	Shall I tell you something -- I
	believed what was called love came
	after the union -- and I was
	surprised when my husband, making me
	a woman, made me know it only by
	pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
	I saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead.  And so we
	became only friends, seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other, yet on good terms for
	a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
	was at his service, but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love,
	he found it tasteless, and seldom
	demanded it.

			RODERICK
	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
	you.  Stop believing in your
	experience.  You have never known
	love.  My very soul is leaving me!
	Catch it on your lips, and give me
	yours!

They kiss ardently.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	To make a long story short, her
	ladyship and I were in love six
	hours after we met; and after I once
	got into her ladyship's good graces,
	I found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy, and was
	scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I shall never forget the
	astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
	when, on one summer evening, as he
	was issuing out to the play-table,
	in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and, in that
	carriage, by her ladyship's side,
	sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
	adventurer," as she was pleased to
	call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

			COUNTESS
	Without you, my dearest, I might
	have died without ever knowing love.
	Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
	Bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter, sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter.  Divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes.

			RODERICK
	Let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that I am happy.

			COUNTESS
	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
	pleased, and I gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me, being certain that, for my
	part, I would never love you.  But
	after our first kiss, I found that I
	had no power over myself.  I did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that, from
	time to time, her ladyship cried
	out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
	am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Sir William Cosgrove, with his
	complication of ills, was dying
	before us by inches.  He was
	continually tinkered up by doctors,
	and, what with my usual luck, he
	might be restored to health and live
	I don't know how many years.  If
	Cosgrove would not die, where was
	the use of my pursing his lady?  But
	my fears were to prove groundless,
	for on that very night, patient
	nature would claim her account.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Good evening, Mr. James, have you
	done with my lady?

			RODERICK
	I beg your pardon?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool.

			RODERICK
	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
	have had too much drink.  Your
	chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter, of
	which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
	He has been troubled by religious
	scruples, and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
	asked for advise from my wife, Lady
	Cosgrove, and between them both,
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith.  Did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple?

			RODERICK
	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
	principles, it's surely better I
	should apply for them to your lady,
	and your chaplin than to you?

			SIR WILLIAM
		   (laughing, but pretty
		    red)
	He wants to step into my shoes!  He
	wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

			RODERICK
	Well, if my intentions are what you
	think they are -- if I do wish to
	step into your shoes, what then?  I
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
	wealth may be great, but am I not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
	not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
	ever showed her; and if I win her,
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
	me, as I am drawing near the goal,
	to find my home such a happy one; my
	wife so fond of me, that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
	see her; like a prudent housewife,
	getting everything ready for her
	husband's departure?

			RODERICK
	I hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon, knight?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Not so soon, my dear, as you may
	fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
	been given over many times these
	four years, and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation.  Who knows how
	long I may keep you waiting.

			RODERICK
	Sir, let those laugh that win.

			SIR WILLIAM
	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting.  Had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic?  What are the odds,
	gentlemen, that I don't live to see
	Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

			VOICE
	Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
	Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
	William Cosgrove, Knight of the
	Bath, Member of Parliament for
	Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
	years His Majesty's representative
	at various European courts.  He hath
	left behind him a name which is
	endeared to all his friends for his
	manifold virtues and talents, a
	reputation justly acquired in the
	service of His Majesty, and an
	inconsolable widow to deplore his
	loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A year from that day, on the
	fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
	I had the honor and happiness to
	lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
	of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
	Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
	I had procured His Majesty's
	gracious permission to add the name
	of my lovely lady to my own, and,
	henceforward, assumed the title of
	James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

			COUNTESS
	My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
	your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

			BROOKSIDE
	He, my father!  I would as soon call
	one of your ladyship's footmen,
	papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

			COUNTESS
	Lord Brookside, you have offended
	your father.

			BROOKSIDE
	Mother, you have offended my father.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a declaration of war to me,
	as I saw at once; though I declare I
	was willing enough to have lived
	with him on terms of friendliness.
	But as men serve me, I serve them.
	Who can blame me for my after-
	quarrels with this young reprobate,
	or lay upon my shoulders the evils
	which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After we had received the
	congratulations of our friends in
	London -- I and Victoria set off to
	visit our country estate, Castle
	Hackton, where I had never as yet
	set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The first days of a marriage are
	commonly very trying; and I have
	known couples, who lived together
	like turtle-doves for the rest of
	their lives, peck each other's eyes
	out almost during the honeymoon.  I
	did not escape the common lot.  In
	our journey westwards, my Lady
	Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
	because I had pulled out a pipe of
	tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
	haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
	I promise you that, in this instant,
	I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had not arrived at the pitch of
	prosperity, and having, at thirty
	years of age, by my own merits and
	energy, raised myself to one of the
	highest social positions that any
	man in England could occupy, I
	determined to enjoy myself as
	becomes a man of quality for the
	remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But it was not meant for me to
	finish my life as a man of quality
	and position.  Indeed, I am one of
	those born clever enough at gaining
	a fortune, but incapable of keeping
	one; for the qualities and energy,
	which lead a man to accept the
	first, are often the very causes of
	his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
	I know of no other reason for the
	misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the end of the year, Lady
	Cosgrove presented me with a son;
	Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
	compliment to my royal ancestry, but
	what more had I to leave him than a
	noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We spent the season in London at our
	house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship and I lived, for a
	while, pretty separate when in
	London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
	say the truth, I preferred it, being
	a great friend to a modest, tranquil
	behavior in woman and a taste for
	the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Besides, she was a mother, and had
	great comfort in the dressing,
	educating, and dandling of our
	little Patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the
	pleasures and frivolities of the
	world; so she left that part of the
	duty of every family of distinction
	to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Countess crying and having an argument with Roderick.
Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship's conversations with me
	were characterized by a stupid
	despair, or a silly blundering
	attempt at forced cheerfulness,
	still more disagreeable; hence, our
	intercourse was but trifling, and my
	temptations to carry her into the
	world or to remain in her society of
	necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She would try my temper, at home,
	too, in a thousand ways.  When
	requested by me to entertain the
	company with conversation, wit, and
	learning, of which she was a
	mistress; or music, of which she was
	an accomplished performer, she
	would, as often as not, begin to
	cry, and leave the room.  My company
	from this, of course, fancied I was
	a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
	only a severe and careful guardian
	of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
	minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite the utter distaste with
	which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
	and, although I took no particular
	pains to disguise my feelings in
	general, yet she was of such a mean
	spirit that she pursued me with her
	regard, and would kindle up at the
	smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, in these fits of love, she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded, and would have
	signed away her whole property, had
	it been possible.  And, I must
	confess, it was with very little
	attention on my part that I could
	bring her into good humor, and, up
	to the very last day of our being
	together, would be reconciled to me,
	and fondle me, if I addressed her a
	single kind word.  Such is female
	inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was luckily very fond of her
	youngest son, and through him I had
	a wholesome and effectual hold on
	her; for if in any of her tantrums
	or fits of haughtiness, she
	pretended to have the upper-hand, to
	assert her authority against mine,
	to refuse to sign such papers as I
	might think necessary for the
	distribution of our large and
	complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I would have Master Patrick carried
	off to Chiswick for a couple of
	days; and I warrant me his lady-
	mother could hold out no longer and
	would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
	more than fashionable people do, and,
	for the first three years, I never
	struck my wife but when I was in
	liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When I flung the carving-knife at
	Brookside, I was drunk, as
	everybody present can testify, but
	as for having any systematic scheme
	against the poor lad, I can declare
	solemnly that, beyond merely hating
	him, I am guilty of no evil towards
	him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Do what one would to please her, my
	lady would never be happy or in good
	humor.  And soon she added a mean,
	detestable jealousy to all her other
	faults, and would weep and wring her
	hands, and threaten to commit
	suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her death would have been no comfort
	to me, as I leave any person of
	common prudence to imagine; for that
	scoundrel of a young Brookside who
	was about to become my greatest
	plague and annoyance, would have
	inherited every penny of the
	property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Humble people envy us great men, and
	fancy that our lives are all
	pleasure.  But the troubles of
	poverty, the rascality of agents,
	the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
	My life at this period seemed to
	consist of nothing but drafts of
	letters and money-brokers relative
	to the raising of money, and the
	insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
	and innumerable correspondence with
	upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
	horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
	stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
	five years old, and was the most
	polite and engaging child ever seen;
	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction; the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion,
	beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
	he could not have been otherwise,
	with the care both his parents
	bestowed upon him, and the
	attentions which were lavished upon
	him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Whereas, young Brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed.  In my company, he
	preserved the most rigid silence,
	and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior I could
	actually take hold of to find fault
	with, although his whole conduct was
	insolent and supercilious to the
	highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In addition to this, the lad was
	fond of spending the chief part of
	his time occupied with the musty old
	books, which he took out of the
	library, and which I hate to see a
	young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The insubordination of that boy was
	dreadful.  He used to quote passages
	of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
	made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As it is best to nip vice in the
	bud, and for a master of a family to
	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He always chose the days when
	company, or the clergy, or gentry of
	the neighborhood were present, to
	make violent, sarcastic, and
	insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

			BROOKSIDE
	Dear child, what a pity it is I am
	not dead for your sake!  The
	Cosgroves would then have a worthy
	representative, and enjoy all the
	benefits of the illustrious blood of
	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of
	Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
	Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

			MOTHER
	This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

			MOTHER
	These things entail considerable
	expense, and you will need your
	lady's blessing, but the young boy
	forms the great bond of union
	between you and her ladyship, and
	there is no plan of ambition you
	could propose in which she would not
	join for the poor lad's benefit, and
	no expense she will not eagerly
	incur, if it might be any means be
	shown to tend to his advancement.
	You have important friends, and they
	can tell you how these things are
	done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, to be sure, I did know someone
	who knew precisely how these things
	were done, and this was the
	distinguished solicitor and former
	Government Minister, Lord West,
	whose acquaintance I made, as I had
	so many others, at the gaming table.

			LORD WEST
	Do you happen to know Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs?

			RODERICK
	By name only.

			LORD WEST
	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
	the gentlemen of His Majesty's
	closet, and one with whom our
	revered monarch is on terms of
	considerable intimacy.  I should say
	you would be wise to fix upon this
	nobleman your chief reliance for the
	advancement of your claim to the
	Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
	paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
	kindly arranged a meeting with that
	old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs.

			EARL OF CRABS
	Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
	person, he or she is safe.  There is
	no question about them any more.  My
	friends are the best people.  I
	don't mean the most virtuous, or,
	indeed, the least virtuous, or the
	cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
	richest, or the best born, but the
	"best" -- in a word, people about
	whom there is no question.  I cannot
	promise you how long it will take.
	You can appreciate it is not an easy
	matter.  But any gentlemen with an
	estate, and ten-thousand a-year
	should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The striving after this peerage, I
	consider to have been one of the
	most unlucky dealings at this
	period.  I made unheard of
	sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
	tell you bribes were administered,
	and in high places too -- so near
	the royal person of His Majesty that
	you would be astonished were I to
	mention what great personages
	condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lavished money here, and diamonds
	there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I bought lands at ten times there
	value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I gave repeated entertainments to
	those friends to my claims who,
	being about the royal person, were
	likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I purchased pictures and articles of
	vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lost many a bet to the royal
	dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One of the main causes of expense
	which this ambition of mine entailed
	upon me was the fitting out and
	arming of a company of infantry from
	the Hackton estates, which I offered
	to my gracious sovereign for the
	campaign against the American
	rebels.  These troops, superbly
	equipped and clothed, were embarked
	at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And the patriotism of the gentlemen
	who raised them was so acceptable at
	court that, on being presented by my
	Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
	to notice me particularly and said:

			GEORGE III
	That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
	another company, and go with them,
	too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Crabs was really one of the most
	entertaining fellows in the world,
	and I took a sincere pleasure in his
	company, besides the interest and
	desire I had in cultivating the
	society of the most important
	personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

			JOHNSON
	If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
	should mind my horses and tailors
	and not trouble myself about
	letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

			RODERICK
	Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
	most grossly, treating my opinions
	with no more respect than those of a
	schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
	a great deal more than me, because
	you quote your "Aristotle" and
	"Plato," but can you tell me which
	horse will win at Epsom Downs next
	week?  Can you shoot the ace of
	spades ten times without missing?
	If so, talk about Aristotle and
	Plato with me.

			BOSWELL
		   (roars)
	Do you know who you're speaking to?!

			JOHNSON
	Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
	no right to brag of my Greek,
	gentlemen, and he has answered me
	very well.

			RODERICK
		   (pleased)
	Do you know ever a rhyme for
	Aristotle?

			GOLDSMITH
		   (laughing)
	Port, if you please.

			JOHNSON
	Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
	rhymes for Aristotle.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
	before we left the coffee house that
	evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

			EARL OF CRABS
	Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
	who wishes to arrange a dinner party
	next week for sixty guests.

			HENRI
	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
	How much do you wish to spend?

			RODERICK
	As much as possible.

			HENRI
	As much as possible?

			RODERICK
	Yes, for I wish to entertain
	splendidly.

			HENRI
	All the same, you must name an
	amount.

			RODERICK
	It is entirely up to you.  I want
	the best.

			EARL OF CRABS
	May I suggest five hundred guineas?

			RODERICK
	Will that be enough?

			HENRI
	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
	spent no more.

			RODERICK
	All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life I was leading was that of a
	happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

			PATRICK
	Papa, please don't flog Brookside
	today.  It wasn't his fault --
	really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, young Brookside was of so
	wild, savage, and insubordinate a
	nature that I never had the least
	regard for him.  As he grew up to be
	a man, his hatred for me assumed an
	intensity quite wicked to think of
	and which, I promise you, I returned
	with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (grinding his teeth)
	Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
	from this moment on, I will submit
	to no further chastisement from you!
	Do you understand that?

			RODERICK
	Give me that pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
	Take heed, Mister James.  I will
	shoot you if you lay hands on me
	now, or ever again.  Is that
	entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I decided, at once, to give up that
	necessary part of his education.
	In truth, he then became the most
	violent, daring, disobedient,
	scapegrace, that ever caused an
	affectionate parent pain; he was
	certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
	attempted to punish my Lord
	Brookside; but I promise you the
	rogue was too strong for him, and
	leveled the Oxford man to the
	ground with a chair, greatly to the
	delight of little Patrick, who cried
	out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
	thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	With the child, Brookside was,
	strange to say, pretty tractable.
	He took a liking to the little
	fellow -- I like him the more, he
	said, because he was "half a
	Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Another day, it was Patrick's
	birthday, we were giving a grand
	ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
	time for my Patrick to make his
	appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (very loudly)
	Don't you think he fits my shoes
	very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

			COUNTESS
	From the manner in which I love this
	child, my lord, you ought to know
	how I would have loved his elder
	brother, had he proved worthy of any
	mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

			BROOKSIDE
	Madam, I have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill-
	treatment of the insolent Irish
	upstart, whom you have taken into
	your bed.  It is not only the
	lowness of his birth, and the
	general brutality of his manners
	which disgusts me, but the shameful
	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship, his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
	infidelity, his habits of
	extravagance, intoxication, his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours.  It is these
	insults to you which shock and annoy
	me more than the ruffian's infamous
	conduct to myself.  I would have
	stood by your ladyship, as I
	promised, but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husband's part; and,
	as I cannot personally chastise this
	low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
	be it spoken, is the husband of my
	mother, and as I cannot bear to
	witness his treatment of you, and
	loathe his horrible society as if it
	were the plague, I am determined to
	quit my native country, at least
	during his detested life, or during
	my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If I had murdered my lord, I could
	scarcely have been received with
	more shameful obloquy and slander
	than now followed me in town and
	country.  My friends fell away from
	me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
	to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My reception at court was scarcely
	more cordial.  On paying my respects
	to my sovereign at St. James, His
	Majesty pointedly asked me when I
	had news of Lord Brookside.  On
	which I replied, with no ordinary
	presence of mind:

			RODERICK
	Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against Your
	Majesty's crown in America.  Does
	Your Majesty desire that I should
	send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
		   (speaking very
		    quietly)
	Let me tell you, sir, that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the King, and has
	formed the subject of royal comment.
	The King has said, influenced by
	these representations, that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
	your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	Hear me out, please.  It has been
	intimated to His Majesty that you
	had raised the American Company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young Viscount to command it, and so
	get rid of him.  And, further, that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company, who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action.

			RODERICK
	Thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed!

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	As for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the Irish peerages, His
	Majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
	money, but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
	in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
	will be disappointed.  He left for
	the continent on Tuesday, and may be
	away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

			RODERICK
	I insist upon being allowed to
	appear before His Majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me, to point out my services to the
	government, and to ask when the
	reward, that had been promised me,
	the title held by my ancestors, is
	again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

			LORD WEST
		   (gently)
	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

			RODERICK
	Yes!

			LORD WEST
	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
	point by point.  The King is
	exceedingly averse to make peers, as
	you know.  Your claim, as you call
	them, have been laid before him, and
	His Majesty's gracious reply was,
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions, and merited a
	halter, rather than a coronet.  As
	for withdrawing your support from
	us, you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please.  And, now, as I have a great
	deal of occupation, perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire, or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The news of His Majesty's disregard
	were not long in getting around,
	and, in a very short time, all the
	bills came down upon me together --
	all the bills I had been contracting
	for the years of my marriage.  I
	won't cite their amount; it was
	frightful.  I was bound up in an
	inextricable toil of bills and
	debts, or mortgages and insurances,
	and all the horrible evils attendant
	upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was it my own want of style, or my
	want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
	I was arrived at the height of my
	ambition, but both my skill and my
	luck seemed to be deserting me.
	Everything I touched, crumbled in my
	hands; every speculation I had,
	failed; every agent I trusted,
	deceived me.  My income was saddled
	with hundreds of annuities, and
	thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
	felt the net drawing closer and
	closer around me, and no means to
	extricate myself from its toils.
	All my schemes had turned out
	failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My wife's moody despondency made my
	house and home not over-pleasant;
	hence, I was driven a good deal
	abroad, where as play was the
	fashion in every club, tavern, and
	assembly, I, of course, was obliged
	to resume my old habit, and to
	commence as an amateur those games
	at which I was once unrivaled in
	Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
	was forced to meet my losses by the
	most shameful sacrifices to the
	money-lenders, and was compelled to
	borrow largely upon my wife's
	annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
	life, which was the condition for
	every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

			BROKER
	Your wife's life is as well known
	among the insurance societies in
	London, as any woman in Christendom,
	and, I'm sorry to say there is not
	one of them willing to place another
	policy against her ladyship's life.
	One of them even had the impudence
	to suggest that your treatment of
	the Countess did not render her life
	worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In the midst of my difficulties, I
	promised to buy a little horse for
	my dear little Patrick, which was to
	be a present for his eighth
	birthday, that was now coming on.  I
	may have had my faults, but no man
	shall dare to say of me that I was
	not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a beautiful little animal,
	and stood me in a good sum.  I never
	regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But the horse was a bit wild, and he
	kicked off one of the horse-boys who
	rode him at first, and broke the
	lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But he was a beautiful animal and
	would make a fine horse for Patrick
	after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

			RODERICK
	Timmy, take the injured lad to see
	the doctor, and then bring the horse
	to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
	break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
	it's for little Patrick, and that
	I'll be over to see him next week.

			HORSE-BOY
	Yes, sir.

			RODERICK
	One more thing, and listen well, I
	don't want little Patrick to know
	where the horse is being kept.  It's
	going to be surprise for his
	birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

			PATRICK
	Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

			PATRICK
	Did you buy the horse, papa?

			RODERICK
	Now, just have a little patience, my
	boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
	week.

			PATRICK
	But I will have it on my birthday,
	won't I?

			RODERICK
	Well, we'll just have to wait and
	see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
	a prince; his breeding and manners,
	even at his early age, showed him to
	be worthy of the two noble families
	from whom he was descended, and I
	don't know what high hopes I had for
	the boy, and indulged in a thousand
	fond anticipations as to his future
	success and figure in the world, but
	stern Fate had determined that I
	should leave none of my race behind
	me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

			PATRICK
		   (kissing him)
	Good night, papa.

			RODERICK
	Good night, my little darling.

			PATRICK
	Papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			PATRICK
	One of the boys in the stable told
	Nelly that you've already bought my
	horse, and that it's at Doolan's
	farm, where Mick the groom is
	breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

			RODERICK
		   (angered)
	What the devil?  What kind of fools
	do we have here?  Pottle, who told
	the lad this story?

			HUNT
	I don't know, sir.

			PATRICK
	Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
	thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

			COUNTESS
	Promise me, Patrick, that you will
	not ride the horse except in the
	company of your father.

			PATRICK
		   (unconvincingly)
	I promise, mama.

			RODERICK
	I promise your lordship a good
	flogging if you even so much as go
	to Doolan's farm to see him.

			PATRICK
	Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

			RODERICK
	Yes...?

			VALET
	I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
	Mr. Hunt has something important to
	tell you.

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			HUNT
	I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
	your orders and stolen off to
	Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
	lad's room this morning, his bed was
	empty.  One of the cooks said she
	saw him go away before daybreak.  He
	must have slipped through my room
	while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

			PATRICK
	You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The doctors were called, but what
	does a doctor avail in a contest
	with the grim, invincible enemy?
	Such as came could only confirm our
	despair by their account of the poor
	child's case.  His spine was
	injured, the lower half of him was
	dead when they laid him in bed at
	home.  The rest did not last long,
	God help me!  He remained yet for
	two days with us, and a sad comfort
	it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

			PATRICK
		   (weakly)
	Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
	me for any acts of disobedience I
	have been guilty of towards you.

			COUNTESS
		   (weeping)
	Oh, my little angel, you have done
	nothing for which you need pardon.

			PATRICK
	Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
	see him.

			RODERICK
	Your bother is in America fighting
	the rebels.

			PATRICK
	Is he all right, papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes, he's fine.

			PATRICK
	Brooksy was better than you, papa,
	he used not to swear so, and he
	taught me many good things while you
	were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

			PATRICK
	I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
	love each other, so that we might
	meet again in heaven where Brooksy
	told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, after two days, he died.
	There he lay, the hope of my family,
	the pride of my manhood, the link
	which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
	together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I won't tell you with what splendor
	we buried him, but what avail are
	undertakers' feathers and heralds'
	trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
	nervous, after our blessed boy's
	catastrophe, became more agitated
	than ever, and plunged into devotion
	with so much fervor that you would
	have fancied her almost distracted
	at times.

Countess sees visions.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She imagined she saw visions.  She
	said an angel from heaven told her
	that Patrick's death was a
	punishment to her for her neglect of
	her firstborn.  Then she would
	declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, my financial affairs were
	near to ruin.  I could not get a
	guinea from any money-dealer in
	London.  Our rents were in the hands
	of receivers by this time, and it
	was as much as I could do to get
	enough money from the rascals to pay
	my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
	property was hampered, and often as
	I applied to my lawyers and agents
	for money, would come a reply
	demanding money of me for debts and
	pretended claims which the rapacious
	rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the only person who,
	in my misfortune, remained faithful
	to me -- indeed, she has always
	spoken of me in my true light, as a
	martyr to the rascality of others,
	and a victim of my own generous and
	confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was an invaluable person to me
	in my house, which would have been
	at rack and ruin before, but for her
	spirit of order and management and
	her excellent economy in the
	government of my rapidly dwindling
	household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If anything could have saved me from
	the consequences of villainy in
	others, it would have been the
	admirable prudence of that worthy
	creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She never went to bed until all the
	house was quiet and all the candles
	out; you may fancy that this was a
	matter of some difficulty with a man
	of my habits who had commonly a
	dozen of jovial fellows to drink
	with me every night, and who
	seldom, for my part, went to bed
	sober.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Actions as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Many and many a night, when I was
	unconscious of her attention, has
	that good soul pulled my boots off,
	and seen me laid by my servants snug
	in bed, and carried off the candle
	herself...

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... and been the first in the
	morning, too, to bring me my drink
	of small beer.  It was my mother's
	pride that I could drink more than
	any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother discovered that always,
	before my lady-wife chose to write
	letters to her milliner, she had
	need of lemons to make her drink, as
	she said, and this fact, being
	mentioned to me, kind of set me
	a-thinking.

			RODERICK
		   (reading letter
		    aloud)
	"This day, three years ago, my last
	hope and pleasure in life was taken
	from me, and my dear child was
	called to Heaven.  Where is his
	neglected brother, whom I suffered
	to grow up unheeded by my side, and
	whom the tyranny of the monster to
	whom I am united drove to exile,
	and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
	child is still alive and safe.
	Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
	of a wretched mother, who
	acknowledges her crime, her coldness
	towards you, and now bitterly pays
	for her error!  What sufferings,
	what humiliations have I had to
	endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
	halls.  I should fear poison, but
	then I know the wretch has a sordid
	interest in keeping me alive, and
	that my death would be the signal
	for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
	without my odious, hideous, vulgar
	gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
	purses my every step.  I am locked
	into my chamber at night, like a
	felon, and only suffered to leave it
	when ordered into the presence of my
	lord, to be present at his orgies
	with his boon-companions, and to
	hear his odious converse as he
	lapses into the disgusting madness
	of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was not possible to recover the
	name for whom the note was intended,
	but it was clear that, to add to all
	my perplexities, three years after
	my poor child's death, my wife,
	whose vagaries of temper and wayward
	follies I had borne with for twelve
	years, wanted to leave me.  I
	decided it best not to reveal to her
	ladyship our discovery, that we
	might still intercept and uncover
	further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Yet I was bound to be on my guard
	that she should not give me the
	slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
	the next day.  I set my mother to
	keep sharp watch over the moods of
	her ladyship, and you may be sure
	that her assistance and surveillance
	were invaluable to me.  If I had
	paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
	I should not have been half so well
	served as by the disinterested care
	and watchfulness of my excellent
	mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
	me was a singular one.  Her life was
	passed in a series of crack-brained
	sort of alternation between love and
	hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
	a fortnight, then we should be
	friends for a month together
	sometimes.  One day, I was joking
	her, and asking her whether she
	would take the water again, whether
	she had found another lover, and so
	forth.  She suddenly burst out into
	tears, and, after a while, said to
	me:

			COUNTESS
	Roderick, you know well enough that
	I have never loved but you!  Was I
	ever so wretched that a kind word
	from you did not make me happy?
	Ever so angry, but the least offer
	of good-will on your part did not
	bring me to your side?  Did I not
	give a sufficient proof of my
	affection for you in bestowing one
	of the finest fortunes of England
	upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
	you for the way you have wasted it?
	No, I loved you too much and too
	fondly; I have always loved you.
	From the first moment I saw you, I
	saw your bad qualities, and trembled
	at your violence; but I could not
	help loving you.  I married you,
	though I knew I was sealing my own
	fate in doing so, and in spite of
	reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
	you want from me?  I am ready to
	make any, so you will but love me,
	or, if not, that at least, you will
	gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was in a particularly good humor
	that day, and we had a sort of
	reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, artful hussy has some
	other scheme in her head now.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The old lady was right, and I
	swallowed the bait which her
	ladyship had prepared to entrap me
	as simply as any gudgeon takes a
	hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

			NEWCOMBE
	May I be quite frank with you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, of course.

			NEWCOMBE
	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life, and meditated
	a separation, in which case, she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance,
	and subject them, at any rate, to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation.
	They were quite insistent on this
	point, and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyship's
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital.

			RODERICK
	I see.

			NEWCOMBE
	When I asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyship's
	assurances, they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth, in their
	presence, at their counting-house in
	Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
	they come here, and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to London,
	but they declined, saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to Castle Hackton to
	negotiate, as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties, such as
	Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
	treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, there is some
	artifice.  When once you get into
	that wicked town, you are not safe.
	There are scores of writs out
	against you for debt.  If you are
	taken in London, and thrown into
	prison, your case is hopeless.

			RODERICK
	Mother dear, we are now living off
	our own beef and mutton.  We have to
	watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
	bailiffs without.  There are certain
	situations in which people cannot
	dictate their own terms; and faith,
	we are so pressed now for money,
	that I would sign a bond with old
	Nick himself, if he would provide a
	good round sum.  With this money, we
	can settle our principal debts and
	make a fresh start.

			MOTHER
	Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
	soon as they have you in London,
	they will get the better of my poor
	innocent lad; and the first thing
	that I shall hear of you will be
	that you are in trouble.  You will
	be a victim of your own generous and
	confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

			COUNTESS
	Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
	as long as you are kind to me, as
	you now are.  We can't appear in
	London as we ought; the little money
	you will get will be spent, like all
	the rest has been.  Let us stay here
	and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother and Roderick.

			MOTHER
	Humph!  I believe she is at the
	bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We did not start in state, you may
	be sure.  We did not let the country
	know we were going, or leave notice
	of adieu with our neighbors.  The
	famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
	noble wife traveled in a hack-
	chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When a man is going to the devil,
	how easy and pleasant a journey it
	is!  The thought of the money quite
	put me in a good humor, and my wife,
	as she lay on my shoulder in the
	post-chaise, going to London, said
	it was the happiest ride she had
	taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One night we stayed at Reading.

INT.  INN - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife at dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My lady and I agreed that, with the
	money, we would go to France, and
	wait there for better times, and
	that night, over our supper, formed
	a score of plans both for pleasure
	and retrenchment.  You would have
	thought it was Darby and Joan
	together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
	Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
	blandishments, how happy she seemed
	to be on that night!  What an air of
	innocent confidence appeared in her
	behavior, and what affectionate
	names she called me!  I am lost in
	wonder at the depth of her
	hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
	that an unsuspecting person like
	myself should have been a victim to
	such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We were in London at three o'clock,
	an half-an-hour before the time
	appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
	apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
	in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

			COUNTESS
	Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
	there is danger.  There's time yet,
	let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

			RODERICK
	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

			COUNTESS
	Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

			COUNTESS
	Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

			COUNTESS
	Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
	fool when I married you, and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a base-born adventurer
	-- a fool to bear, without repining,
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered; to allow my property
	to be squandered; to see women as
	base and low-born as yourself...

			TAPEWELL
	For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

			RODERICK
	You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
	said "old" fool.

			BROOKSIDE
	I have no doubt that you said and
	did, sir, everything that a
	blackguard could say or do.  This
	lady is now safe under the
	protection of her relations and the
	law, and need fear your infamous
	persecutions no longer.

			RODERICK
	But you are not safe, and as sure as
	I am a man of honor, I will have
	your heart's blood.

			TAPEWELL
	Take down his words, constables;
	swear the peace against him.

			BROOKSIDE
	I would not sully my sword with the
	blood of such a ruffian.  If the
	scoundrel remains in London another
	day, he will be seized as a common
	swindler.

			RODERICK
	Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

			RODERICK
	Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
	cowardly braggart, come first, if
	you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

			TAPEWELL
	We are not going to seize you!  My
	dear sir, we don't wish to seize
	you; we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country, only leave her
	ladyship in peace.

			BROOKSIDE
	And the country will be rid of such
	a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was no longer the man I was at
	twenty, when I should have charged
	the ruffians, sword in hand, and
	sent at least one of them to his
	account.  I was broken in spirit,
	regularly caught in the toils,
	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman.  Was she relenting at the
	door, when she paused and begged me
	to turn back?  Had she not a
	lingering love for me still?  Her
	conduct showed it, as I came to
	reflect on it.  It was my only
	chance now left in the world, so I
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

			RODERICK
	Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
	you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
	visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

			TAPEWELL
	I have been authorized by Lady
	Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return.  I advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know, as well as I do, that your
	stay in London will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol, as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of England,
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling.  I will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal,
	but if you refuse, the family will
	proceed against you in London, and
	have you arrested.  If you accede, a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
	night to consider this proposal.
	What other choice has a poor, lonely
	and broken-hearted man?  I shall
	take the annuity, and leave the
	country.

			MR. TAPEWELL
	I am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
	I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

			NARRATOR
	Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
	narrative finishes here, for the
	hand of death interrupted the
	ingenious author soon after the
	period which this memoir was
	compiled, after he had lived
	nineteen years an inmate of the
	Fleet Prison, where the prison
	records state he died of delirium
	tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

			NARRATOR
	His faithful old mother joined him
	in his lonely exile, and had a

	way.  She would come and stay the
	whole day with him in prison
	working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

			NARRATOR
	The Countess was never out of love
	with her husband, and, as long as
	she lived, James enjoyed his income
	of 300 pounds per year and was,
	perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
	any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

			NARRATOR
	When her ladyship died, her son
	sternly cut off the annuity,
	devoting the sum to charities,
	which, he said, would make a nobler
	use of it than the scoundrel who had
	enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

			NARRATOR
	When the famous character lost his
	income, his spirit entirely failed.
	He was removed into the pauper's
	ward, where he was known to black
	boots for wealthier prisoners, and
	where he was detected in stealing a
	tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

			NARRATOR
	His mother attained a prodigious old
	age, and the inhabitants of the
	place in her time can record, with
	accuracy, the daily disputes which
	used to take place between mother
	and son, until the latter, from
	habits of intoxication, falling into
	a state of almost imbecility, was
	tended by his tough old parent as a
	baby almost, and would cry if
	deprived of his necessary glass of
	brandy.

TITLE CARD

	It was in the reign of George III
	that the above-named personages
	lived and quarreled; good or bad,
	handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they
	are all equal now.

FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My father, who was well-known to the
	best circles in this kingdom under
	the name of roaring Harry James, was
	killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
	years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother, after her husband's
	death, and her retirement, lived in
	such a way as to defy slander.  She
	refused all offers of marriage,
	declaring that she lived now for her
	son only, and for the memory of her
	departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day.  But if she was
	proud of her beauty, to do her
	justice, she was still more proud of
	her son, and has said a thousand
	times to me that I was the
	handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The good soul's pleasure was to
	dress me; and on Sundays and
	Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
	coat with a silver-hilted sword by
	my side, and a gold garter at my
	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land.  As we walked to church on
	Sundays, even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My uncle's family consisted of ten
	children, and one of them was the
	cause of all my early troubles; this
	was the belle of the family, my
	cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  That first affair, how well one
	remembers it!  What a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one!  A lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private.  So it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
	instance, was always practicing, and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the exciseman, when he came
	his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the young apothecary's lad
	from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
	beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

			RODERICK
	I accept, but I insist on a wager.
	The loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases.

			DOROTHY
	Agreed.

			RODERICK
	Do you see the gate at the end of
	the field?  The first to touch it
	will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was certain to win, but I meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

			DOROTHY
	Your penalty is to find a cherry-
	colored ribbon which I have hidden
	somewhere on my person.  You are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will, and I will think very little
	of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

			RODERICK
	I feel the ribbon.

			DOROTHY
	Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

			DOROTHY
	Why are you shaking?

			RODERICK
	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	About this time, the United Kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a French invasion.  The noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders.  How I envied
	them.  The whole country was alive
	with war's alarums; the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music, while poor I was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I have endured torments in my life,
	but none like that.  Some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me, for I was the best
	dancer in the room, but I was too
	wretched, and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony.  I did
	not care for drink, or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days; but I thought of killing
	myself and Dorothy, and most
	certainly of making away with
	Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, and at morning, the ball
	was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

			DOROTHY
	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
	dear, and you'll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

			DOROTHY
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a
	pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
	were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
	throw me, you careless creature,
	you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

			RODERICK
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
	And I only danced with her because
	-- because -- the person with whom I
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night.

			DOROTHY
	I had not been in the room five
	minutes before I was engaged for
	every single set.

			RODERICK
	Were you obliged to dance five times
	with Captain Best, and then stroll
	out with him into the garden?

			DOROTHY
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
	he dances prettily to be sure, and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
	looks well in his regimentals, too;
	and if he chose to ask me to dance,
	how could I refuse him?

			RODERICK
	But you refused me, Dorothy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
	Best's a man, and you are only a
	boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
	world.

			RODERICK
	If ever I meet him again, you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two.  I'll fight him with sword or
	with pistol, captain as he is.

			DOROTHY
	But Captain Best is already known as
	a valiant soldier, and is famous as
	a man of fashion in London.  It is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers'
	boys, but to fight an Englishman is
	a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

			DOROTHY
	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
	such a hero, was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side.

			RODERICK
	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
	through them.

			DOROTHY
	What, with me on the pillion?  Would
	you kill poor me?

			RODERICK
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
	do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
	and swim you both across, where no
	enemy could follow us.

			DOROTHY
	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
	to do any such thing on Daisy.
	There's the captain's horse, Black
	George, I've heard say that Captain
	Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

			RODERICK
	Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I went home, and was ill speedily of
	a fever, which kept me to my bed for
	a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dorothy visited me only once, but I
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than I had been
	ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

			RODERICK
	Whose horse, fellow, is that?

			ORDERLY
	Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
	to my captain, and he's a better
	fellow nor you any day.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I did not stop to break his bones,
	as I would on another occasion, for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me, and I made for the garden as
	quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The fact is that, during the week of
	my illness, no other than Captain
	Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
	and making love to Miss Dorothy in
	form.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	No, Dorothy, except for you and four
	others, I vow before all the gods,
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame.

			DOROTHY
	Ah, you men, you men, John, your
	passion is not equal to ours.  We
	are like -- like some plant I've
	read of -- we bear but one flower,
	and then we die!

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another?

			DOROTHY
	Never, my John, but for thee!  How
	can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I pulled out a knot of cherry-
	colored ribbons, which she had given
	me out of her breast, and which
	somehow I always wore upon me, and
	flung them in Captain Best's face,
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn.

			RODERICK
	She's a liar -- she's a liar,
	Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
	yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

			DOROTHY
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
	spare the child -- he is but an
	infant.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	And ought to be whipped for his
	impudence, but never fear, Miss
	Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
	favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

			CAPTAIN BEST
	When ladies make presents to
	gentlemen, it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire...

			DOROTHY
	Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
	and don't signify any more than my
	parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

			RODERICK
		   (roaring)
	I'm a man, and will prove it.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
	many yards as you like.

			DOROTHY
	Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
	will!  Roddy, will you see me
	insulted?

			RODERICK
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
	have his blood as sure as my name's
	Roderick.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll send for the usher to cane you,
	little boy, but as for you, miss, I
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

			MICHAEL
	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
	matter here?

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
	I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
	and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
	to 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

			DOROTHY
		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (whisper to Dorothy)
	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (in a soothing tone
		    to Roderick)
	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

			RODERICK
		   (shouts after
		    Michael)
	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
	must first kill me -- do you mind
	that?

			MICHAEL
		   (shouting back from
		    a distance)
	Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
	you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
	huntsman to do it.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	You are a gallant lad, and I like
	your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
	true.  It's a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far-
	gone state as you; but, believe me,
	I know the world, and if you will
	but follow my advice, you won't
	regret having taken it.  Dorothy
	Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
	whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
	don't you see -- though it's a hard
	matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
	and does not care a pin for you or
	Best either?

			RODERICK
	Dorothy might love me or not, as she
	likes, but Best will have to fight
	me before he marries her!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Faith, I think you are a lad that's
	likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
	for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
	at three o'clock, which wakened me
	from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

			MAID
	The Englishman's still there, Master
	Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
	Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
	you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

			UNCLE
	Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
	That's right.

			AUNT
	He'd better be home with his mother.

			UNCLE
	Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast -- didn't
	agree with her.  Take a glass of
	spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
	health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

			UNCLE
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought
	with the captain!  See who'll be
	married first.  Jack Best, my dear
	boy, never mind a clean glass for
	the claret, we're short of crystal
	at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
	the wine will taste none the worse.
	Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
	please; this is a sort of toast that
	is drunk a great deal too seldom in
	my family, and you'll please to
	receive it with all the honors.
	Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
	Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
	her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
	you've got a treasure.

			RODERICK
		   (spring up)
	His already?!

			HARRY
	Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
	your tongue!

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	He has already been slapped in the
	face this morning, Captain John
	Best; he's already been called a
	coward, Captain John Best; and this
	is the way I'll drink his health.
	Here's your health, Captain John
	Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

			HARRY
	You fool!  You great blundering
	marplot -- you silly beggarly
	brat --
		   (a thump at each)
	Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

			UNCLE
	In Heaven's name, what does all the
	row mean?  Is the boy in fever
	again?

			HARRY
		   (turning to his
		    father)
	The fact is, sir, that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	Dorothy, and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today, he was for murdering Jack
	Best.

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (bristling up)
	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
	I've been insulted grossly in this
	house.  I ain't at all satisfied
	with these here ways of going on.
	I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
	of property; and I -- I --

			HARRY
	If you're insulted, and not
	satisfied, remember there's two of
	us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

			RODERICK
		   (in dignified tone)
	Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases, by calling on
	Roderick James, Esquire, of
	Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

			RODERICK
	Captain Grogan, I beg you to
	understand that, for my cousin
	Harry, who has been my best friend
	through life, I could put up with
	rough treatment from him; yet, even
	that sort of treatment I will bear
	from him no longer; and any other
	person who ventures on the like will
	not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
	that fact very well; and, if he's
	man, he'll know where to find me.

			UNCLE
	It is getting late, and your mother
	will be anxious about you.  One of
	you had better go home with him.
		   (turning to his sons)
	Or the lad may be playing more
	pranks.

			HARRY
	Both of us ride home with Best here.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
	man is armed, and so am I.

			HARRY
	You know the use of arms very well,
	Best, and no one can doubt your
	courage; but Michael and I will see
	you home for all that.

			UNCLE
	Why, you'll not be home till
	morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
	ten miles from here.

			HARRY
	We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
	We're going to stop a week there.
	And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A pretty day's work of it you have
	made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
	uncle to be distressed for money,
	and try and break off a match which
	will bring fifteen hundred a-year
	into the family?  Best has promised
	to pay off the four thousand pounds
	which is bothering your uncle so.
	He takes a girl without a penny -- a
	girl that has been flinging herself
	at the head of every man in these
	parts these ten years past, and
	missing them all, and a boy who
	ought to be attached to your uncle
	as to your father.

			RODERICK
	And so I am.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And this is the return you make for
	his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
	in his house when your father died,
	and hasn't he given you and your
	mother, rent-free, your fine house
	of Jamesville yonder?

			RODERICK
	Mark this, come what will of it, I
	swear I will fight the man who
	pretends to the hand of Dorothy
	Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
	the church, and meet him there.
	I'll have his blood, or he shall
	have mine.  Will you take my message
	to him, and arrange the meeting?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
	young fellow, you are the most
	bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
	officer, bearing His Majesty's
	commission, can receive a glass of
	wine on his nose, without resenting
	it -- fight you must, and Best is a
	huge, strong fellow.

			RODERICK
	He'll give the better mark.  I am
	not afraid of him.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	In faith, I believe you are not; for
	a lad I never saw more game in my
	life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
	You're after my own soul.  As long
	as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
	never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
	afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
	thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
	know what is in store for us, and
	that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In spite of my precautions to
	secrecy, I half-suspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival,
	and received our guest, Captain
	Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But she would not say a word about
	the quarrel, for she had a noble
	spirit, and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never slept sounder in my life,
	though I woke a little earlier than
	usual, and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day,
	for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And now I sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters; they might be the
	last, thought I, that I should ever
	write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then I went down to breakfast, where
	my mother was waiting for me, you
	may be sure.  We did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

			MOTHER
	Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  They have their faults, those
	mothers; but are there any other
	women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

			RODERICK
	Have you taken my message to him?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	The meeting is arranged.  Captain
	Best is waiting for you now.

			RODERICK
	My mare is saddled and ready; who's
	the captain's second?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
	The curtains of her bedroom-windows
	were down, and they didn't move as
	we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	That's a very handsome sword you
	have there.

			RODERICK
	It was with this sword that my late
	father, Harry James, God rest his
	soul, met Sir Huddelstone
	Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
	and was fatally run through the
	neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
	having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
	when in liquor, at the Brentford
	Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
	scorned to apologize.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And now you risk the same fate.  If
	you are killed, your mother is all
	alone in the world.

			RODERICK
	I am Harry James' son, and will act
	as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

			RODERICK
		   (to Captain Grogan)
	I hope to spoil this sport, and
	trust to see this sword of mine in
	that big bully's body.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
	are no match for Best with the
	sword.

			RODERICK
	I'll match any man with the sword.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	But swords are today impossible;
	Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
	knocked his knee against the
	swinging park gate last night, as he
	was riding home, and can scarce move
	it now.

			RODERICK
	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
	has been off the hinges these ten
	years.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I have just explained to Mister
	James that Captain Best is lame, and
	that swords are impossible.

			HARRY
	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

			HARRY
	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for
	he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
	he, Grogan?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
	the man who stood to Captain Best.

			HARRY
	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

			HARRY
		   (with a laugh to
		    Grogan)
	There's nothing else for it.  Take
	your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
	I suppose?

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (in a big voice)
	Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
	do you hear, Captain Grogan?

			HARRY
	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
	pistols.
		   (with some emotion
		    to Roderick)
	God bless you, my boy; and when I
	count three, fire.

			RODERICK
	This is not one of my pistols.

			HARRY
	They are all right, never fear.
	It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
	if they are needed, for the next
	round.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
	him there under the gorget; see how
	the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

			THE SECONDS
		   (crying out)
	He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

			MICHAEL
	He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

			HARRY
	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

			RODERICK
	It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

			RODERICK
	There!  Take her those ribbons.
	She'll know what they mean; that's
	all that's left of her of two lovers
	she had and ruined.

			MICHAEL
	And now, in Heaven's name, get the
	youngster out of the way.

			HARRY
	I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I need not tell you how great was my
	mother's pride and exultation when
	she heard from Harry's lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

			HARRY
	The boy must go into hiding, for a
	short time anyway.  Dublin is the
	best place for him to go, and there
	wait until matters are blown over.

			MOTHER
	Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
	been away from home.  He will be as
	safe here as in Dublin.

			HARRY
	I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
	but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure, in which
	argument, as I was anxious to see
	the world, I must confess, I sided
	with him; and my mother was brought
	to see that, in our small house, in
	the midst of a village, escape would
	be impossible, and capture would be
	impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

			MOTHER
		   (gravely)
	Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one.  I spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel, and
	all signs betoke a separation.  Here
	is twenty guineas -- all that I have
	in the world -- and I want you to
	keep your father's sword and
	pistols, which you have known to use
	so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She hurried my departure now, though
	her heart, I know, was full, and
	almost in half-an-hour from my
	arrival at home, I was once more on
	the road again, with the wide world,
	as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	No lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time, and
	twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
	rode away, thinking, I confess, not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone, and of the home behind me, as
	of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
	would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had no doubts of the future;
	thinking that a man of my person,
	parts, and courage, could make his
	way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
	to myself, or chatting with the
	passersby; and all the girls along
	the road said, "God save me, for a
	clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
	there seemed to be a gap of a half-
	a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Where are you bound for?

			RODERICK
		   (after a long look at
		    his companion)
	That is none of your business.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel?

			RODERICK
		   (pulling out a
		    pistol)
	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			FOOTMAN
	Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	O the coward!  To let the Captain
	bate you, and he only one eye!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #3
	The next time my lady travels, she'd
	better leave you at home!

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

			FOOTMAN
	Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	That fool didn't know what was the
	meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
	which was in the pocket-book that
	the fellow took from me.

			RODERICK
	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you, I shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	But I shouldn't like to put you to
	such trouble, Mister...?

			RODERICK
	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

			RODERICK
		   (very gallantly)
	As you have been robbed of your
	purse, may I have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home?

			MRS. O'REILLY
		   (smiling)
	That's very kind of you, Mr.
	O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
	assemblies.  In every sentence, she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality.  To the lady's question
	about my birth and parentage, I
	replied that I was a young gentleman
	of large fortune, that I was going
	to Dublin for my studies, and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	You must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in Dublin, where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound.
	I hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house,
	where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
	with delight, my gallant young
	preserver.

Paying the bill.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Perhaps had I been a little older in
	the world's experience, I should
	have begun to see that Madame
	O'Reilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be; but, as
	it was, I took all her stories for
	truth, and, when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner, paid it
	with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so we rode on slowly towards
	Dublin, into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
	and splendor of the coaches, the
	flare of the linkboys, the number
	and magnificence of the houses,
	struck me with the greatest wonder;
	though I was careful to disguise
	this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance, and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
	grateful I am for your timely
	assistance to my wife.

			RODERICK
	I am only sorry that I was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyship's money and
	pearls.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
	and rest assured, sir, you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in Dublin.
		   (pours a glass)
	Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
	your good father?

			RODERICK
	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
	of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
	was a close friend of my wife's dear
	father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

			RODERICK
	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
	are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	My love, I wish I had known of your
	coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty, which His Grace the Lord
	Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar.  You
	know the wine, my dear?  But as
	bygones are bygones, and no help for
	them, what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
	things from the table, and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
	don't seem to have any small change.
	May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
	give to the girl?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	I have some money, my dear.  Here,
	Betty, go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper, and mind you
	get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our supper was seasoned, if not by
	any great elegance, at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes,
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city, with whom, according to
	himself, the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
	behind hand with him, I spoke of my
	own estates and property as if I was
	as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Had I been an English lad, the
	appearance of the chamber I occupied
	might, indeed, have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust.
	But we are not particular in Ireland
	on the score of neatness, hence the
	disorder of my bed-chamber did not
	strike me so much.

Broken door.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was there a lock to the door, or a
	hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
	O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And my cracked toilet-glass not much
	bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
	used to these sort of ways in Irish
	houses, and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was no lock to the drawers,
	which, when they did open, were full
	of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
	stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I needn't ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed.  Young Fred
	Pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months, during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me, and if he was
	satisfied, I don't know who else
	wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After breakfast, we drove out to
	Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to Mrs.
	O'Reilly, to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that, before half an hour, I had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had little notion then that I had
	got amongst a set of impostors --
	that Captain O'Reilly was only an
	adventurer, and his lady a person of
	no credit.  The fact was, a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which I
	now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which, you
	may be sure, that cards were not
	wanting, and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company?  And in a very, very
	short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

			RODERICK
	I shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

			COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
	Master Roderick, you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune; let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
	regular gang of swindlers; and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company.  The captain has been a
	gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
	of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
	your valise, pay the little trifle
	you owe me, mount your mare, and
	ride back again to your parents --
	it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Into a pretty nest of villains,
	indeed, was I plunged!  When I
	returned to my bed-chamber, a few
	hours later, it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Whom have I been harboring in my
	house?  Who are you, sirrah?

			RODERICK
	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
	gentleman as any in Ireland!

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	You're an impostor, young man, a
	schemer, a deceiver!

			RODERICK
	Repeat the words again, and I run
	you through the body.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
	well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
	Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
	secret is known, is it?  You come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families; you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis; I take
	you to my tradesmen, who give you
	credit.  I accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds, and what do I
	find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
	but Roderick James of the devil only
	knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
	you why I was obliged to alter my
	name, which is James and the best
	name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
	because, on the day before I came to
	Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
	combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
	Captain in His Majesty's service;
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way, the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
	O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
	child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
	Heaven's name, let him go.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
		   (sulkily)
	He may go hang for me, and he's
	better be off quickly, for I shall
	go to the magistrate if I see him
	again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Where was now a home for the
	descendant of the James?  I was
	expelled from Dublin by a
	persecution occasioned, I must
	confess, by my own imprudence.  I
	had no time to wait and choose.  No
	place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

			RODERICK
	I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
	a young gentleman in difficulties; I
	have killed an officer in a duel,
	and I am anxious to get out of the
	country.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I needn't have troubled myself
	with any explanations; King George
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came -- and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
	chosen my time better.  A transport
	was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
	wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company, and hate all
	descriptions of low life.  Hence my
	account of the society in which I at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short.  The
	reminiscences of the horrid black-
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined, of the wretched
	creatures with whom I was now forced
	to keep company, of the plowmen,
	poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
	refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
	in truth, I had done myself, is
	enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

			RODERICK
	Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

			MR. TOOLE
	Get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands, and serve him a basin of
	turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	If you want to vex him, ask him
	about his wife, the washerwoman, who
	bates him.

			RODERICK
	Is it a towel of your wife's
	washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
	wiped your face often with one.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	Ask him why he wouldn't see her
	yesterday, when she came to the
	ship.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so I put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
	pecking, and flat-irons, which set
	the man into a fury, and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	This victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom I
	formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our passage was very favorable, and
	in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
	and before I had been a month in the
	Electorate, I was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier, and,
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise, was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	There's only six Miss Dugans now...
	poor Dorothy.

			RODERICK
	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
	died of grief?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	She took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband.  She is now
	Mrs. John Best.

			RODERICK
	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
	Mr. John Best?!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	No, the very same one, my boy.  He
	recovered from his wound.  The ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
	Do you think the Dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
	of the family?  The plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way, for the cowardly
	Englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you.  But hit him
	you certainly did, Roderick, and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow,
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to.
	We told your mother the story
	afterwards, and a pretty scene she
	made.

			RODERICK
	The coward!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	He has paid off your uncle's
	mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
	and-six.  That coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncle's
	family.  Faith, the business was
	well done.  Your cousins, Michael
	and Harry, never let him out of
	their sight, though he was for
	deserting to England, until the
	marriage was completed, and the
	happy couple off on their road to
	Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
	boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
	a couple of hundred out of Master
	Best for my share and, while they
	last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our regiment, which was quartered
	about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the Rhine, where we would
	fight the famous battle of Minden.
	It would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than I am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	Seven Years' War in which Europe was
	engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated, and the books written
	about it so amazingly hard to
	understand, that I have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning, and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal
	disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Were these memoirs not characterized
	by truth, I might easily make myself
	the hero of some strange and popular
	adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I saw no one of the higher ranks
	that day than my colonel and a
	couple of orderly officers riding by
	in the smoke -- no one on our side,
	that is.  A poor corporal is not
	generally invited into the company
	of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
	you, some very good company on the
	French part, for their regiments of
	Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
	charging us all day; and in the sort
	of melee high and low are pretty
	equally received.  I hate bragging,
	but I cannot help saying that I made
	a very close acquaintance with the
	colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And finished off a poor little
	ensign, so young, slender, and
	small, that a blow from my pigtail
	would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And in the poor ensign's pocket
	found a purse of fourteen louis
	d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
	plums, of which the former present
	was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If people would tell their stories
	of battles in this simple way, I
	think the cause of truth would not
	suffer by it.  All I know of this
	famous fight of Minden, except from
	books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

			CAPTAIN
	Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
	your company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	That was all the epitaph my brave
	patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I should have left you a hundred
	guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
	run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When we came back to our ground,
	which we presently did, he was lying
	still, but he was dead.  Some of our
	people had already torn off his
	epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
	his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After the death of my protector,
	Captain Grogan, I am forced to
	confess that I fell into the very
	worst of courses and company.  In a
	foreign country, with the enemy
	before us, and the people
	continually under contribution from
	one side or the other, numberless
	irregularities were permitted to the
	troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
	talk of the age of chivalry; but
	remember the starving brutes whom
	they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
	entirely ignorant, made to take
	pride in deeds of blood -- men who
	can have no amusement but in
	drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
	It is with these shocking
	instruments that your great warriors
	and kings have been doing their
	murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The year in which George II died,
	our regiment had the honor to be
	present at the Battle of Warburg,
	where Prince Ferdinand once more
	completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	During the action, my lieutenant,
	Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
	struck by a musket-ball in the side.
	He had shown no want of courage in
	this or any other occasion where he
	had been called upon to act against
	the French; but this was his first
	wound, and the young gentleman was
	exceedingly frightened by it.

			LAKENHAM
	Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
	pay you five guineas if you will
	carry me into the town which is hard
	by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We put the patient to bed, and he
	paid me the stipulated reward.  A
	young surgeon, who desired nothing
	better than to take himself out of
	the fire of the musketry, came
	presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

			PRIVATE
	I should get half.

			RODERICK
	Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

			PRIVATE
	He gave you five guineas, and I
	bloody well expect half.

			RODERICK
	Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

			LAKENHAM
		   (languidly, in pain)
	Who are you putting into that bed?

			LISCHEN
	We have the Corporal, wounded, to
	you bringing.

			LAKENHAM
	A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
	sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I found Lischen the tenderest of
	nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
	to be provided for the wounded
	lieutenant, a share was always sent
	to the bed opposite his, and to the
	avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor was I the only person in the
	house to whom the worthy gentleman
	was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
	Lischen hither and thither, made
	impertinent love to her, abused her
	soups, quarreled with her
	omelettes, and grudged the money
	which was laid out for his
	maintenance, so that our hostess
	detested him as much as, I think,
	without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For if truth must be told, I had
	made very deep love to her during my
	stay under her roof, as is always my
	way with women, of whatever age or
	degree of beauty.  Do not think me
	very cruel and heartless, ladies;
	this heart of Lischen's was like
	many a town, which had been stormed
	and occupied several times before I
	came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I began to reflect how pleasant my
	quarters were to me, and that I was
	much better here than crawling under
	an odious tent with a parcel of
	tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
	rounds, or rising long before
	daybreak for drill.  I determined
	that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

			RODERICK
	I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
	to take my leave of you.  I intend
	to have your papers and purse.

			LAKENHAM
	You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
	dog!  What do you mean by dressing
	yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
	as my name's Lakenham, when we get
	back to the regiment, I'll have your
	soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
	are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My companion treated me with great
	civility, and asked me a thousand
	questions about England, which I
	answered as best I might.  But this
	best, I am bound to say, was bad
	enough.  I knew nothing about
	England, and I invented a thousand
	stories which I told him; described
	the king and the ministers to him,
	said the British ambassador in
	Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
	acquaintance a letter of
	recommendation to him.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What is your uncle's name?

			RODERICK
		   (slowly)
	O'Grady.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (with a laugh)
	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
	O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It hurts my feelings to be obliged
	to commune with such wretches, but
	the stern necessities of war demand
	men continually, and hence these
	recruiters whom you see market in
	human flesh.  They get five-and-
	twenty thaler a man from our
	government for every man they bring
	in.  For fine men -- for men like
	you.
		   (he adds laughing)
	They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	This is a very good inn.  Shall we
	stop for dinner?

			RODERICK
	This may be a very good inn for
	Germany, but it would not pass in
	old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
	league off, let us push on for
	Corbach.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Do you want to see the loveliest
	woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
	influence you.

			RODERICK
	The place seems more a farm than an
	inn-yard.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The people are great farmers, as
	well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (explaining the gate)
	Parties of French horsemen are about
	the country, and one cannot take too
	many precautions against such
	villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
	a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (when she leaves)
	Where's the beauty you promised me?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (laughing and looking
		    hard at Roderick)
	It was my joke.  I was tired, and
	did not care to go farther.  There's
	not prettier woman here than that.
	If she won't suit your fancy, my
	friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (sternly)
	Upon my word, sir, I think you have
	acted very coolly.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I have acted as I think fit.

			RODERICK
	Sir, I'm a British officer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
	You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
	and folly have confirmed this to me.
	You pretend to carry dispatches to a
	general who has been dead these ten
	months; you have an uncle who is an
	ambassador and whose name you don't
	know.  Will you join and take the
	bounty, sir, or will you be given
	up?

			RODERICK
	Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Advance a step, and I send this
	bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

			RODERICK
	I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the close of the Seven Years' War,
	the Prussian army, so renowned for
	its disciplined valor, was
	officered and under-officered by
	native Prussians, it is true, but
	was composed for the most part of
	men hired or stolen, like myself,
	from almost every nation in Europe.
	The deserting to and fro was
	prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life the private soldier led was
	a frightful one to any but the men
	of iron courage and endurance.  The
	punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was not near so unhappy, in spite
	of all, as I had been on my first
	enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
	there will be no one of my
	acquaintance who will witness my
	shame, and that is the point which I
	have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
	you are caught, there is no use in
	repining -- make the best of your
	situation, and get all the pleasure
	you can out of it.  There are a
	thousand opportunities of plunder,
	offered to the soldier in war time,
	out of which he can get both
	pleasure and profit; make use of
	these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I do not intend to make a history of
	battles in the Prussian any more
	than in the English service.  I did
	my duty in them as well as another,
	and there was not a braver,
	cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
	own, wickeder soldier in the
	Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

			RODERICK
	I had formed myself to the condition
	of the proper fighting beast; on a
	day of action, I was savage and
	happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

			COLONEL BULOW
	You are a gallant soldier, and have
	evidently come of good stock; but
	you are idle, dissolute, and
	unprincipled; you have done a deal
	of harm to the men; and, for all
	your talents and bravery, I am sure
	you will come to no good.

			RODERICK
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
	regarding my character.  I have
	fallen into bad company, it is true;
	but I have only done as other
	soldiers have done; and, above all,
	I have never had a kind friend and
	protector before, to whom I might
	show that I was worthy of better
	things.  The Colonel may say I am a
	ruined lad, and send me to the
	devil; but be sure of this, I would
	go to the devil to serve the
	regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Soon after the war ended, our
	regiment was garrisoned in the
	capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
	all the towns of Prussia; but that
	does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

			RODERICK
	Private Roderick James.  First
	Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
	Galgenstein sent for me.

			PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
	You may wait.

			RODERICK
	Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

			PRIVATE
	Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
	the Captain's furniture, but the
	driver says he is not supposed to
	unload it.  Is it possible for you
	to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
	Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
	You are a model of probity!  You'll
	never succeed to my place, my dear
	nephew, if you are no wiser than you
	are just now.  Make the fellow as
	useful to you as you please.  You
	say he has a good manner and a frank
	countenance, that he can lie with
	assurance, and fight, you say, on a
	pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
	for good qualities.  As long as you
	have the regiment in terrorem over
	him, you can do as you like with
	him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
	is likely to give you the slip.
	Keep on promising him; promise to
	make him a general, if you like.
	What the deuce do I care?  There are
	spies enough to be had in this town
	without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Good morning, Private James.  Please
	come in.  I should like you to meet
	my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
	Galgenstein.

			RODERICK
	How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The captain was the nephew and heir
	of the Minister of Police, Herr
	Galgenstein, a relationship which,
	no doubt, aided in the younger
	gentlemen's promotion.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well -- and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us; if you
	succeed, depend on it, your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

			RODERICK
	What is the service, sir?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	There is lately come to Berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	Empress Queen, who calls himself the
	Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	pope's order of the Spur.  He is
	made for good society, polished,
	obliging, a libertine, without
	prejudices, fond of women, of good
	food, of high play, prudent and
	discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	He speaks Italian and French
	indifferently; but we have some
	reason to fancy this Monsieur de
	Belle Fast is a native of your
	country of Ireland, and that he has
	come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Naturally, your knowledge of English
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service.  Of course, you will
	not know a word of English; and if
	the Chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent, say
	you are Hungarian.  The servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today, and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you.

Roderick nods.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You are a Hungarian; you served in
	the army, and left on account of
	weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
	great deal, and wins.  Do you know
	the cards well?

			RODERICK
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I had thought you more expert.  You
	must find out if the Chevalier
	cheats.  He sees the English and
	Austrian envoys continually, and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house.  Find out
	what they talk of, for how much each
	plays, especially if any of them
	play on parole.  If you are able to,
	read his private letters, though
	about those which go to the post,
	you need not trouble yourself -- we
	look at them there.  But never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes, and by what channel
	or messenger.  He sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatch-box with a
	string around his neck -- twenty
	frederics, if you get an impression
	of the keys.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Does this assignment interest you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, Minister, I am interested in
	any work in which I can be of
	service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	You are the young man who M. de
	Seebach recommended?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

			CHEVALIER
	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.

			CHEVALIER
	You come highly recommended by Herr
	Seebach.

			RODERICK
	Herr Seebach was a very kind
	employer.

			CHEVALIER
	For whom else have you worked?

			RODERICK
	No one, sir.  Before that I served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins.

			CHEVALIER
	Who else can give me information
	about you?

			RODERICK
	Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

			CHEVALIER
	You will do.  I will give you 30...
	a day.  I do not provide your
	clothing; you will sleep at home,
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

			CHEVALIER
	Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was very imprudent of me; but
	when I saw the splendor of his
	appearance, the nobleness of his
	manner, I felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him.  You, who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity; and there's a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

			RODERICK
		   (as he speaks,
		    bursting into tears)
	Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
	am an Irishman, and my name is
	Roderick James.  I was abducted into
	the Prussian army two years ago, and
	now I have been put into your
	service by my Captain and his uncle,
	the Minister of Police, to serve as
	a watch upon your actions, of which
	I am to give information to the same
	quarter.  For this odious service, I
	have been promised my discharge, and
	a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

			CHEVALIER
	The rascals!  They think to catch
	me, do they?  Why, young man, my
	chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
	But the king is so jealous, that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital, in
	the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And I think he was as much affected
	as I was at thus finding one of his
	kindred; for he, too, was an exile
	from home, and a friendly voice, a
	look, brought the old country back
	to his memory again, and the old
	days of his boyhood.

			CHEVALIER
	I'd give five years of my life to
	see the old country again, the
	greenfields, and the river, and the
	old round tower, and the burying
	place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			CHEVALIER
	My lad, I have been in every
	service; and, between ourselves, owe
	money in every capital in Europe.  I
	have been a rolling stone.  Play --
	play has been my ruin!  That and
	beauty.  The women have made a fool
	of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
	hearted creature, and this minute,
	at sixty-two, have no more command
	of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
	made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

			CHEVALIER
	The cards are now my only
	livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
	and then I lay out my money in these
	trinkets you see.  It's property,
	look you, and the only way I have
	found of keeping a little about me.
	When the luck goes against me, why,
	my dear, my diamonds go to the
	pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
	you understand the cards?

			RODERICK
	I can play as soldiers do, but have
	no great skill.

			CHEVALIER
	We will practice in the mornings, my
	boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
	or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I carried my little reports to
	Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous.  These reports, of
	course, were arranged between me and
	the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
	instructed, and it is always the
	best way, to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

			RODERICK
	He goes to church regularly -- he is
	very religious, and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner, which is served at
	noon.  After dinner, he writes his
	letters, if he has any letters to
	write; but he has very little to do
	in this way.  His letters are to the
	Austrian envoy, with whom he
	corresponds, but who does not
	acknowledge him; and being written
	in English, or course, I look over
	his shoulder.  He generally writes
	for money.  He makes his party with
	Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
	the Russian attaches, two from the
	English embassy, my lords Deuceace
	and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
	and a few more.  He wins often, but
	not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
	fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
	the English Minister, sometimes
	comes, on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was agreed that I should keep my
	character of valet, that in the
	presence of strangers I should not
	know a word of English, that I
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when I was serving the
	champagne and punch about; and,
	having a remarkably fine eyesight,
	and a great natural aptitude, I was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Simplicity was our secret.
	Everything successful is simple.
	If, for instance, I wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin, it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
	ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
	wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
	If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
	blew my nose, it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary; and then,
	I warrant you, some pretty trials of
	skill would take place.  The Prince
	of Turbingen, although so young, had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way; and it
	was only from hearing Ritter von
	Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
	three times when the Chevalier had
	the ace of trumps, that I knew we
	were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
	I believe you have cheated me.

			CHEVALIER
	I deny your Grace's accusations, and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated?

			PRINCE
		   (glaring at Roderick)
	I don't know.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics, which I have honorably
	won.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, if you will have your
	money now, you must fight for it.
	If you will be patient, maybe I will
	pay you something another time.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
	take this, then I must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation.

			PRINCE
	I have said all there is to be said.
	I am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Was he cheated?

			RODERICK
	In so far as I can tell these things
	-- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
	the money fairly.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Hmm-mmmm.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What are the Chevalier's intentions?

			RODERICK
	I am not sure.  The Prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money, he would have to
	fight for it.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	A meeting with the Prince of
	Turbingen is impossible.

			RODERICK
	The Prince left him only that
	choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	Tell them I intend to demand
	satisfaction from the Prince.

			RODERICK
	But they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost.

			CHEVALIER
	Have no fear.  It will come out well
	for me.

			RODERICK
	I believe they will deport you.

			CHEVALIER
	I have faced that problem before.

			RODERICK
	But, if they send you away, then
	what is to become of me?

			CHEVALIER
		   (with a smile)
	Make your mind easy, you shall not
	be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
	take a last look at your barracks,
	make your mind easy, say a farewell
	to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
	souls, how they will weep when they
	hear you are out of the country,
	and, out of it, you shall go.

			RODERICK
	But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	The King has determined to send the
	Chevalier out of the country.

			RODERICK
	When is he to go?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Has he sent the challenge yet?

			RODERICK
	Not yet, but I believe he intends
	to.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Then this must be done tomorrow.

			RODERICK
	What is to be done?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You say he drives after breakfast
	and before dinner.  When he comes
	out to his carriage a couple of
	gendarmes will mount the box, and
	the coachman will get his orders to
	move on.

			RODERICK
	And his baggage?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
	have a fancy to look into that red
	box which contains his papers, you
	say; and at noon, after parade,
	shall be at the inn.  You will not
	say a word to any one there
	regarding the affair, and will wait
	for me at the Chevalier's rooms
	until my arrival.  We must force
	that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
	or you would have got the key long
	ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At ten o'clock the next morning, the
	carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
	Fast drew up as usual at the door of
	his hotel, and the Chevalier came
	down the stairs in his usual stately
	manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (standing by the
		    carriage)
	I will let down the steps for your
	honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

			CHEVALIER
	Good gracious!  What is this?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (touching his hat)
	You are going to drive to the
	frontier.

			CHEVALIER
	It is shameful -- infamous!  I
	insist upon being put down at the
	Austrian ambassador's house.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	I have orders to gag your honor if
	you cry out, and to give you this
	purse containing ten thousand
	frederics if you do not.

			CHEVALIER
	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
	owes me seventy thousand.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Your honor must lower his voice.

			CHEVALIER
		   (whispering)
	All Europe shall hear of this!

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
	only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Hearing the sound of the alarm
	cannon, the common people came out
	along the road, with fowling-pieces
	and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
	the truant.  The gendarmes looked
	very anxious to be on the lookout
	for him too.  The price of a
	deserter was fifty crowns to those
	who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

			CHEVALIER
	I have no luggage.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	The gentleman has nothing
	contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

			CHEVALIER
	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
	Will you please go to the house from
	whence we set out this morning, and
	tell my man there to send my baggage
	on to Three Kings at Dresden?

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then ordering fresh horses, the
	Chevalier set off on his journey for
	that capital.  I need not tell you
	that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
	Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
	Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
	Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
	Roderick -- This comes to you by a
	sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
	of the English mission, who is
	acquainted, as all Berlin will be
	directly, with our wonderful story.
	They only know half as yet; they
	only know that a deserter went off
	in my clothes, and all are in
	admiration of your cleverness and
	valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	As I lay in my bed two and a half
	hours after your departure, in comes
	your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (in his imperious
		    Dutch manner)
	Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Straightaway he makes for the red
	box where I keep my love letters, my
	glass eye which I used to wear, my
	two sets of Paris teeth, and my
	other private matters that you know
	of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
	but none of them fit the English
	lock.  Then he takes out of his
	pocket a chisel and hammer, and
	falls to work like a professional
	burglar, actually bursting open the
	little box!  Now was my time to act!
	I advance towards him armed with an
	immense water-jug.  I come
	noiselessly up to him just as he has
	broken the box, and, with all my
	might, I deal him such a blow over
	the head as smashes the water-jug to
	bits, and sends the captain with a
	snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
	I ring all the bells in the house;
	and shout, and swear, and scream,
	"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
	-- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
	household comes tumbling up the
	stairs.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my servant?  Who dares to
	rob me in open day?  Look at the
	villain whom I find in the act of
	breaking my chest open!  Send for
	the police, send for his Excellency
	the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
	shall know of this insult!

			LANDLORD
	Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
	three hours ago.

			CHEVALIER
	Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
	all morning.  I am ill -- I have
	taken physic -- I have not left the
	house this morning!  Where is that
	scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
	are my clothes and wig?

			CHAMBERMAID
	I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
	off in your honor's dress.

			CHEVALIER
	And my money -- my money!  Where is
	my purse with forty-eight frederics
	in it?  But we have one of the
	villains left, Officers, seize him.

			LANDLORD
		   (more and more
		    astonished)
	It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

			CHEVALIER
	What!  A gentleman breaking open my
	trunk with hammer and chisel --
	impossible!

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Herr Galgenstein was returning to
	life by this time, with a swelling
	on his skull as big as a saucepan;
	and the officers carried him off,
	and, to make a long story short,
	poor Galgenstein is now on his way
	to Spandau; and his uncle, the
	Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
	brought me five hundred louis, with
	a humble request that I would leave
	Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
	painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
	particularly good order with the
	Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
	was, at this period, the most
	brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He spent fabulous sums on the
	ballets and operas.  All the
	ballerinas were pretty, and they all
	boasted that they had all at least
	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the
	beautiful talk to us.  There was no
	man in Europe more gay in spirits,
	more splendid in personal
	accomplishment, than young Roderick
	James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What a delightful life did we now
	lead!  I knew I was born a
	gentleman, from the kindly way in
	which I took to the business, as
	business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at
	play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I
	had never done anything else all my
	life.  I had a gentleman to wait
	upon me, a French friseur to dress
	my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I knew the taste of chocolate as by
	intuition almost, and could
	distinguish between the right
	Spanish and the French before I had
	been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had rings on my fingers, watches
	in both my fobs, trinkets, and
	snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
	outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had the finest natural taste for
	lace and china of any man I ever
	knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I could judge a horse as well as any
	dealer in Germany.  I could not
	spell, but I could speak German and
	French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had at least twelve suits of
	clothes; three richly embroidered
	with gold, two laced with silver;
	one of French grey, silver-laced and
	lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
	morning robes, to which a peacock's
	tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
	skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I took lessons on the guitar, and
	sang French catches exquisitely.
	Where, in fact, was there a more
	accomplished gentleman than Roderick
	James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How have we had the best blood, and
	the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
	throbbing round the table as I and
	the Chevalier have held the cards
	and the bank against some terrible
	player, who was matching some
	thousands out of his millions
	against our all which was there on
	the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our principles were:  play grandly,
	honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
	down at losing; but, above all, be
	not eager at winning, as mean souls
	are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When the Duke of Courland brought
	fourteen lackeys each with bags of
	florins, and challenged our bank to
	play against the sealed bags, what
	did we ask?

			CHEVALIER
	Sir, we have but eighty thousand
	florins in bank, or two hundred
	thousand at three months; if your
	highness' bags do not contain more
	than eight thousand, we will meet
	you.

Playing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we did, and after eleven hours
	play, in which our bank was at one
	time reduced to two hundred and
	three ducats, we won seventeen
	thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor need I mention my successes
	among the fairer portion of the
	creation.  One of the most
	accomplished, the tallest, the most
	athletic, and the handsomest
	gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
	a young fellow of my figure could
	not fail of having advantages, which
	a person of my spirit knew very well
	how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dark Valdez.

			RODERICK
	Do you expect me to believe that
	your lover brought you here tonight?

			VALDEZ
	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
	and he will call for me at midnight.

			RODERICK
	And he doesn't care about me?

			VALDEZ
	He is only curious to know who you
	are.

			RODERICK
	If his love were like mine, he would
	not permit you to come here.

			VALDEZ
	He loves me, as I love you.

			RODERICK
	Will he wish to know the details of
	this night?

			VALDEZ
	He will believe that it will please
	me if he asks about it, and I shall
	tell him everything except some
	circumstances which might humiliate
	him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

			LANGEAC
	I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

			LANGEAC
	There you are, dressed by my hand.
	It is nearly the same thing; but
	despite the fineness and
	transparency of the skin, the little
	fellow pleases me less well in
	costume.  It seems that this
	covering degrades him, or degrades
	me -- one of the other.

			RODERICK
	Both, my angel.  It was Love who
	invented these little jackets:  for
	he had to ally himself with
	Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

			COUNT
	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
	moment for you; it seems that you
	love this lady.

			RODERICK
	Certainly, monseigneur, does not
	Your Excellency consider her worthy
	of love?

			COUNT
	Perfectly so; and what is more, I
	will tell you that I love her, and
	that I am not of a humor to put up
	with rivals.

			RODERICK
	Very well!  Now that I know it, I
	will no longer love her.

			COUNT
	Then you yield to me.

			RODERICK
	On the instant.  Everyone must yield
	to such a nobleman as you.

			COUNT
	Very well; but a man who yields
	takes to his legs.

			RODERICK
	That is a trifle strong.

			COUNT
	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

			RODERICK
	Your Excellency has wantonly
	insulted me.  That being so, I
	conclude that you hate me,
	Monseigneur, and that hence you
	would be glad to remove me from the
	number of the living.  In this wish,
	I can and will satisfy Your
	Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol, and readiness to
	use them, that maintained the
	reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

			DASCHER
	I see that you are without your
	sword, but I believe you are a man
	of mettle.  Will you give me
	satisfaction?

			RODERICK
	I shall be delighted; but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet, for, after all, you
	cannot pay me when you are dead.

			ANOTHER OFFICER
	I will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis, but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

			DASCHER
	I may have been mistaken, but I mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

			RODERICK
		   (privately)
	It is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel -- that should be work for
	a hangman.

			CHEVALIER
	To risk one's life against such
	people is an imposition.

			RODERICK
		   (laughs)
	I risk nothing, for I am certain to
	kill him.

			CHEVALIER
	Certain?

			RODERICK
	Perfectly certain, because I shall
	make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

			RODERICK
	You have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference, and fire
	first.  The space between these two
	trees is the place where I choose to
	walk back and forth.  You may walk
	too, if you wish, when it is my turn
	to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

			DASCHER
	But we must decide who is to have
	the first shot.

			RODERICK
	There is no need of that.  I never
	fire first; and, in any case, you
	have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

			RODERICK
		   (with the greatest
		    composure)
	You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
	would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Thus is will be seen that our life,
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger,
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success, and sudden and
	unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

			RODERICK
	I am posting, monsieur, and
	furthermore I am a foreigner.

			STRANGER
	Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
	has no special right, and if you are
	a foreigner, you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine,
	since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The ladies were passionately fond of
	play, and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us; for the truth
	most be told, that the ladies loved
	to play, but not to pay.  The point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex; and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table, could get
	their money if they lost or, if they
	paid, prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	On this evening, the lady of high
	rank, after I had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
	sent her lover with a band of cut-
	throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
	Countess and a Viscountess in her
	own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the wife of her cousin, the
	Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
	Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
	Minister to George II and George III
	of several of the smaller courts of
	Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the mother to Viscount
	Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
	little boy, about whom his father
	was more than indifferent, and whom
	his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I made Sir William Cosgrove's
	acquaintance as usual at the play-
	table.  One could not but admire the
	spirit and gallantry with which he
	pursued his favorite pastime; for,
	though worn out with gout and a
	myriad of diseases, a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair, and
	suffering pangs of agony, yet you
	would see him every morning, and
	every evening at his post behind the
	delightful green cloth.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
	have no more manners than a barber,
	and I think my black footman has
	been better educated than you; but
	you are a young fellow of
	originality and pluck, and I like
	you, sir.  because you seem
	determined to go to the devil by a
	way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

			RODERICK
	I am obliged to observe, Sir William
	Cosgrove, that since you are bound
	for the next world much sooner than
	I am, I will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me.

Laughter.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
	me.  Marriage has added forty years
	to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
	cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
	I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself.  Fool that I was!
	I had enough with my pensions,
	perfect freedom, the best society in
	Europe -- and I gave up all these,
	and married and was miserable.  Take
	a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
	stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
	but marry.

			RODERICK
	Would you have me spend my life all
	alone?

			SIR WILLIAM
	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
	marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

			RODERICK
		   (laughing)
	The milkmaid's daughter?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
	No man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wife's sake; on
	the contrary, if he selects the
	animal properly, he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance.  For instance, I have
	got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power.  My wife never comes near
	me.  What friend have I?  None in
	the wide world.  Men of the world,
	as you and I are, don't make
	friends, and we are fools for our
	pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

			SIR WILLIAM
	My lady is a weak woman, but she is
	my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in Christendom.  She is
	enormously rich, but somehow I have
	never been so poor, as since I
	married her.  I thought to better
	myself, and she has made me
	miserable and killed me, and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

			RODERICK
	Has her ladyship a very large
	income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite my friend's strong warning.
	I resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
	dying.  His widow would be a rich
	prize.  Why should I not win her,
	and, with her, the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired?
	When I determine, I look upon the
	thing as done.

			RODERICK
	Charming lady, tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude.  Have you a
	lover?

The countess laughs.

			COUNTESS
	No.

			RODERICK
	Have you had one?

			COUNTESS
	Never.

			RODERICK
	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

			COUNTESS
	Not even that.

			RODERICK
	How can I believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you?

			COUNTESS
	Not one.

			RODERICK
	Have you not a man whom you value?

			COUNTESS
	That man has, perhaps, not yet been
	born.

			RODERICK
	What!  You have not met a man worthy
	of your attention?

			COUNTESS
	Many worthy of attention; but
	valuing is something more.  I could
	value only someone whom I loved.

			RODERICK
	Then you have never loved?  Your
	heart is empty.

			COUNTESS
	Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
	Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
	it is fortunate, I congratulate
	myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
	not care, for I am not aware of it.

			RODERICK
	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
	you will know it when you love.

			COUNTESS
	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune.

			RODERICK
	That is true, but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love.

			COUNTESS
	It is only too possible.  Love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult, and it is even more
	difficult to make it last.

			RODERICK
	I agree; but God put us on earth to
	take that risk.

			COUNTESS
	A man may need to do that, and find
	it amusing; but a girl is bound by
	other laws.

			RODERICK
	I believe you, and I see I must
	hasten to leave, for otherwise I
	shall become the unhappiest of men.

			COUNTESS
	How so?

			RODERICK
	By loving you, with no hope of
	possessing you.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	You want my heart?

			RODERICK
	It is my only object.

			COUNTESS
	To make me wretched in two weeks.

			RODERICK
	To love you until death.  To
	subscribe to all your commands.

			COUNTESS
	The amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing, if it is
	true that you love me.

			RODERICK
	Deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me.  If I do
	not know it, I am innocent.

			COUNTESS
	But you deceive me nonetheless if I
	believe you, for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

			COUNTESS
	Be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are?

			RODERICK
	With a woman who is completely
	charming, be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition, and
	who, regardless of her rank, will
	show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	And if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness?

			RODERICK
	Then I will respectfully take leave
	of her.

			COUNTESS
	You will do as you please.  It seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other.  Do you not agree?

			RODERICK
	Yes -- but I am afraid of being
	deceived.

			COUNTESS
	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
	want to begin where people end?

			RODERICK
	I ask only a payment on account
	today -- after that, you will find
	me undemanding, obedient and
	discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

			RODERICK
	Will we always leave it at this?

			COUNTESS
	Always, my dear one, never any
	further.  Love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles.  A full diet
	can only kill it.

			RODERICK
	I know better than you do.  Love
	wants a more substantial fare, and
	if it is stubbornly withheld, it
	withers away.

			COUNTESS
	Our abstinence makes our love
	immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago, now I should love
	you even more.  But I should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires.

			RODERICK
	Let us give each other complete
	happiness, and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires, they will each time be born
	anew.

			COUNTESS
	My husband has convinced me of the
	contrary.

			RODERICK
	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
	dying, and yet I envy him more than
	any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
	privilege of which I am deprived.
	He may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases, and no veil keeps his
	senses, his eyes, his soul from
	enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

			COUNTESS
	Shall I tell you something -- I
	believed what was called love came
	after the union -- and I was
	surprised when my husband, making me
	a woman, made me know it only by
	pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
	I saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead.  And so we
	became only friends, seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other, yet on good terms for
	a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
	was at his service, but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love,
	he found it tasteless, and seldom
	demanded it.

			RODERICK
	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
	you.  Stop believing in your
	experience.  You have never known
	love.  My very soul is leaving me!
	Catch it on your lips, and give me
	yours!

They kiss ardently.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	To make a long story short, her
	ladyship and I were in love six
	hours after we met; and after I once
	got into her ladyship's good graces,
	I found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy, and was
	scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I shall never forget the
	astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
	when, on one summer evening, as he
	was issuing out to the play-table,
	in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and, in that
	carriage, by her ladyship's side,
	sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
	adventurer," as she was pleased to
	call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

			COUNTESS
	Without you, my dearest, I might
	have died without ever knowing love.
	Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
	Bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter, sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter.  Divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes.

			RODERICK
	Let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that I am happy.

			COUNTESS
	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
	pleased, and I gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me, being certain that, for my
	part, I would never love you.  But
	after our first kiss, I found that I
	had no power over myself.  I did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that, from
	time to time, her ladyship cried
	out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
	am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Sir William Cosgrove, with his
	complication of ills, was dying
	before us by inches.  He was
	continually tinkered up by doctors,
	and, what with my usual luck, he
	might be restored to health and live
	I don't know how many years.  If
	Cosgrove would not die, where was
	the use of my pursing his lady?  But
	my fears were to prove groundless,
	for on that very night, patient
	nature would claim her account.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Good evening, Mr. James, have you
	done with my lady?

			RODERICK
	I beg your pardon?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool.

			RODERICK
	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
	have had too much drink.  Your
	chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter, of
	which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
	He has been troubled by religious
	scruples, and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
	asked for advise from my wife, Lady
	Cosgrove, and between them both,
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith.  Did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple?

			RODERICK
	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
	principles, it's surely better I
	should apply for them to your lady,
	and your chaplin than to you?

			SIR WILLIAM
		   (laughing, but pretty
		    red)
	He wants to step into my shoes!  He
	wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

			RODERICK
	Well, if my intentions are what you
	think they are -- if I do wish to
	step into your shoes, what then?  I
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
	wealth may be great, but am I not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
	not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
	ever showed her; and if I win her,
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
	me, as I am drawing near the goal,
	to find my home such a happy one; my
	wife so fond of me, that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
	see her; like a prudent housewife,
	getting everything ready for her
	husband's departure?

			RODERICK
	I hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon, knight?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Not so soon, my dear, as you may
	fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
	been given over many times these
	four years, and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation.  Who knows how
	long I may keep you waiting.

			RODERICK
	Sir, let those laugh that win.

			SIR WILLIAM
	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting.  Had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic?  What are the odds,
	gentlemen, that I don't live to see
	Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

			VOICE
	Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
	Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
	William Cosgrove, Knight of the
	Bath, Member of Parliament for
	Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
	years His Majesty's representative
	at various European courts.  He hath
	left behind him a name which is
	endeared to all his friends for his
	manifold virtues and talents, a
	reputation justly acquired in the
	service of His Majesty, and an
	inconsolable widow to deplore his
	loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A year from that day, on the
	fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
	I had the honor and happiness to
	lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
	of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
	Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
	I had procured His Majesty's
	gracious permission to add the name
	of my lovely lady to my own, and,
	henceforward, assumed the title of
	James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

			COUNTESS
	My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
	your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

			BROOKSIDE
	He, my father!  I would as soon call
	one of your ladyship's footmen,
	papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

			COUNTESS
	Lord Brookside, you have offended
	your father.

			BROOKSIDE
	Mother, you have offended my father.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a declaration of war to me,
	as I saw at once; though I declare I
	was willing enough to have lived
	with him on terms of friendliness.
	But as men serve me, I serve them.
	Who can blame me for my after-
	quarrels with this young reprobate,
	or lay upon my shoulders the evils
	which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After we had received the
	congratulations of our friends in
	London -- I and Victoria set off to
	visit our country estate, Castle
	Hackton, where I had never as yet
	set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The first days of a marriage are
	commonly very trying; and I have
	known couples, who lived together
	like turtle-doves for the rest of
	their lives, peck each other's eyes
	out almost during the honeymoon.  I
	did not escape the common lot.  In
	our journey westwards, my Lady
	Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
	because I had pulled out a pipe of
	tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
	haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
	I promise you that, in this instant,
	I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had not arrived at the pitch of
	prosperity, and having, at thirty
	years of age, by my own merits and
	energy, raised myself to one of the
	highest social positions that any
	man in England could occupy, I
	determined to enjoy myself as
	becomes a man of quality for the
	remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But it was not meant for me to
	finish my life as a man of quality
	and position.  Indeed, I am one of
	those born clever enough at gaining
	a fortune, but incapable of keeping
	one; for the qualities and energy,
	which lead a man to accept the
	first, are often the very causes of
	his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
	I know of no other reason for the
	misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the end of the year, Lady
	Cosgrove presented me with a son;
	Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
	compliment to my royal ancestry, but
	what more had I to leave him than a
	noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We spent the season in London at our
	house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship and I lived, for a
	while, pretty separate when in
	London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
	say the truth, I preferred it, being
	a great friend to a modest, tranquil
	behavior in woman and a taste for
	the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Besides, she was a mother, and had
	great comfort in the dressing,
	educating, and dandling of our
	little Patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the
	pleasures and frivolities of the
	world; so she left that part of the
	duty of every family of distinction
	to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Countess crying and having an argument with Roderick.
Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship's conversations with me
	were characterized by a stupid
	despair, or a silly blundering
	attempt at forced cheerfulness,
	still more disagreeable; hence, our
	intercourse was but trifling, and my
	temptations to carry her into the
	world or to remain in her society of
	necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She would try my temper, at home,
	too, in a thousand ways.  When
	requested by me to entertain the
	company with conversation, wit, and
	learning, of which she was a
	mistress; or music, of which she was
	an accomplished performer, she
	would, as often as not, begin to
	cry, and leave the room.  My company
	from this, of course, fancied I was
	a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
	only a severe and careful guardian
	of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
	minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite the utter distaste with
	which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
	and, although I took no particular
	pains to disguise my feelings in
	general, yet she was of such a mean
	spirit that she pursued me with her
	regard, and would kindle up at the
	smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, in these fits of love, she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded, and would have
	signed away her whole property, had
	it been possible.  And, I must
	confess, it was with very little
	attention on my part that I could
	bring her into good humor, and, up
	to the very last day of our being
	together, would be reconciled to me,
	and fondle me, if I addressed her a
	single kind word.  Such is female
	inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was luckily very fond of her
	youngest son, and through him I had
	a wholesome and effectual hold on
	her; for if in any of her tantrums
	or fits of haughtiness, she
	pretended to have the upper-hand, to
	assert her authority against mine,
	to refuse to sign such papers as I
	might think necessary for the
	distribution of our large and
	complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I would have Master Patrick carried
	off to Chiswick for a couple of
	days; and I warrant me his lady-
	mother could hold out no longer and
	would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
	more than fashionable people do, and,
	for the first three years, I never
	struck my wife but when I was in
	liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When I flung the carving-knife at
	Brookside, I was drunk, as
	everybody present can testify, but
	as for having any systematic scheme
	against the poor lad, I can declare
	solemnly that, beyond merely hating
	him, I am guilty of no evil towards
	him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Do what one would to please her, my
	lady would never be happy or in good
	humor.  And soon she added a mean,
	detestable jealousy to all her other
	faults, and would weep and wring her
	hands, and threaten to commit
	suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her death would have been no comfort
	to me, as I leave any person of
	common prudence to imagine; for that
	scoundrel of a young Brookside who
	was about to become my greatest
	plague and annoyance, would have
	inherited every penny of the
	property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Humble people envy us great men, and
	fancy that our lives are all
	pleasure.  But the troubles of
	poverty, the rascality of agents,
	the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
	My life at this period seemed to
	consist of nothing but drafts of
	letters and money-brokers relative
	to the raising of money, and the
	insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
	and innumerable correspondence with
	upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
	horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
	stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
	five years old, and was the most
	polite and engaging child ever seen;
	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction; the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion,
	beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
	he could not have been otherwise,
	with the care both his parents
	bestowed upon him, and the
	attentions which were lavished upon
	him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Whereas, young Brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed.  In my company, he
	preserved the most rigid silence,
	and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior I could
	actually take hold of to find fault
	with, although his whole conduct was
	insolent and supercilious to the
	highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In addition to this, the lad was
	fond of spending the chief part of
	his time occupied with the musty old
	books, which he took out of the
	library, and which I hate to see a
	young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The insubordination of that boy was
	dreadful.  He used to quote passages
	of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
	made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As it is best to nip vice in the
	bud, and for a master of a family to
	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He always chose the days when
	company, or the clergy, or gentry of
	the neighborhood were present, to
	make violent, sarcastic, and
	insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

			BROOKSIDE
	Dear child, what a pity it is I am
	not dead for your sake!  The
	Cosgroves would then have a worthy
	representative, and enjoy all the
	benefits of the illustrious blood of
	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of
	Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
	Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

			MOTHER
	This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

			MOTHER
	These things entail considerable
	expense, and you will need your
	lady's blessing, but the young boy
	forms the great bond of union
	between you and her ladyship, and
	there is no plan of ambition you
	could propose in which she would not
	join for the poor lad's benefit, and
	no expense she will not eagerly
	incur, if it might be any means be
	shown to tend to his advancement.
	You have important friends, and they
	can tell you how these things are
	done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, to be sure, I did know someone
	who knew precisely how these things
	were done, and this was the
	distinguished solicitor and former
	Government Minister, Lord West,
	whose acquaintance I made, as I had
	so many others, at the gaming table.

			LORD WEST
	Do you happen to know Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs?

			RODERICK
	By name only.

			LORD WEST
	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
	the gentlemen of His Majesty's
	closet, and one with whom our
	revered monarch is on terms of
	considerable intimacy.  I should say
	you would be wise to fix upon this
	nobleman your chief reliance for the
	advancement of your claim to the
	Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
	paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
	kindly arranged a meeting with that
	old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs.

			EARL OF CRABS
	Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
	person, he or she is safe.  There is
	no question about them any more.  My
	friends are the best people.  I
	don't mean the most virtuous, or,
	indeed, the least virtuous, or the
	cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
	richest, or the best born, but the
	"best" -- in a word, people about
	whom there is no question.  I cannot
	promise you how long it will take.
	You can appreciate it is not an easy
	matter.  But any gentlemen with an
	estate, and ten-thousand a-year
	should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The striving after this peerage, I
	consider to have been one of the
	most unlucky dealings at this
	period.  I made unheard of
	sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
	tell you bribes were administered,
	and in high places too -- so near
	the royal person of His Majesty that
	you would be astonished were I to
	mention what great personages
	condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lavished money here, and diamonds
	there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I bought lands at ten times there
	value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I gave repeated entertainments to
	those friends to my claims who,
	being about the royal person, were
	likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I purchased pictures and articles of
	vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lost many a bet to the royal
	dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One of the main causes of expense
	which this ambition of mine entailed
	upon me was the fitting out and
	arming of a company of infantry from
	the Hackton estates, which I offered
	to my gracious sovereign for the
	campaign against the American
	rebels.  These troops, superbly
	equipped and clothed, were embarked
	at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And the patriotism of the gentlemen
	who raised them was so acceptable at
	court that, on being presented by my
	Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
	to notice me particularly and said:

			GEORGE III
	That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
	another company, and go with them,
	too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Crabs was really one of the most
	entertaining fellows in the world,
	and I took a sincere pleasure in his
	company, besides the interest and
	desire I had in cultivating the
	society of the most important
	personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

			JOHNSON
	If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
	should mind my horses and tailors
	and not trouble myself about
	letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

			RODERICK
	Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
	most grossly, treating my opinions
	with no more respect than those of a
	schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
	a great deal more than me, because
	you quote your "Aristotle" and
	"Plato," but can you tell me which
	horse will win at Epsom Downs next
	week?  Can you shoot the ace of
	spades ten times without missing?
	If so, talk about Aristotle and
	Plato with me.

			BOSWELL
		   (roars)
	Do you know who you're speaking to?!

			JOHNSON
	Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
	no right to brag of my Greek,
	gentlemen, and he has answered me
	very well.

			RODERICK
		   (pleased)
	Do you know ever a rhyme for
	Aristotle?

			GOLDSMITH
		   (laughing)
	Port, if you please.

			JOHNSON
	Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
	rhymes for Aristotle.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
	before we left the coffee house that
	evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

			EARL OF CRABS
	Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
	who wishes to arrange a dinner party
	next week for sixty guests.

			HENRI
	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
	How much do you wish to spend?

			RODERICK
	As much as possible.

			HENRI
	As much as possible?

			RODERICK
	Yes, for I wish to entertain
	splendidly.

			HENRI
	All the same, you must name an
	amount.

			RODERICK
	It is entirely up to you.  I want
	the best.

			EARL OF CRABS
	May I suggest five hundred guineas?

			RODERICK
	Will that be enough?

			HENRI
	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
	spent no more.

			RODERICK
	All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life I was leading was that of a
	happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

			PATRICK
	Papa, please don't flog Brookside
	today.  It wasn't his fault --
	really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, young Brookside was of so
	wild, savage, and insubordinate a
	nature that I never had the least
	regard for him.  As he grew up to be
	a man, his hatred for me assumed an
	intensity quite wicked to think of
	and which, I promise you, I returned
	with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (grinding his teeth)
	Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
	from this moment on, I will submit
	to no further chastisement from you!
	Do you understand that?

			RODERICK
	Give me that pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
	Take heed, Mister James.  I will
	shoot you if you lay hands on me
	now, or ever again.  Is that
	entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I decided, at once, to give up that
	necessary part of his education.
	In truth, he then became the most
	violent, daring, disobedient,
	scapegrace, that ever caused an
	affectionate parent pain; he was
	certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
	attempted to punish my Lord
	Brookside; but I promise you the
	rogue was too strong for him, and
	leveled the Oxford man to the
	ground with a chair, greatly to the
	delight of little Patrick, who cried
	out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
	thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	With the child, Brookside was,
	strange to say, pretty tractable.
	He took a liking to the little
	fellow -- I like him the more, he
	said, because he was "half a
	Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Another day, it was Patrick's
	birthday, we were giving a grand
	ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
	time for my Patrick to make his
	appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (very loudly)
	Don't you think he fits my shoes
	very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

			COUNTESS
	From the manner in which I love this
	child, my lord, you ought to know
	how I would have loved his elder
	brother, had he proved worthy of any
	mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

			BROOKSIDE
	Madam, I have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill-
	treatment of the insolent Irish
	upstart, whom you have taken into
	your bed.  It is not only the
	lowness of his birth, and the
	general brutality of his manners
	which disgusts me, but the shameful
	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship, his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
	infidelity, his habits of
	extravagance, intoxication, his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours.  It is these
	insults to you which shock and annoy
	me more than the ruffian's infamous
	conduct to myself.  I would have
	stood by your ladyship, as I
	promised, but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husband's part; and,
	as I cannot personally chastise this
	low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
	be it spoken, is the husband of my
	mother, and as I cannot bear to
	witness his treatment of you, and
	loathe his horrible society as if it
	were the plague, I am determined to
	quit my native country, at least
	during his detested life, or during
	my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If I had murdered my lord, I could
	scarcely have been received with
	more shameful obloquy and slander
	than now followed me in town and
	country.  My friends fell away from
	me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
	to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My reception at court was scarcely
	more cordial.  On paying my respects
	to my sovereign at St. James, His
	Majesty pointedly asked me when I
	had news of Lord Brookside.  On
	which I replied, with no ordinary
	presence of mind:

			RODERICK
	Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against Your
	Majesty's crown in America.  Does
	Your Majesty desire that I should
	send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
		   (speaking very
		    quietly)
	Let me tell you, sir, that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the King, and has
	formed the subject of royal comment.
	The King has said, influenced by
	these representations, that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
	your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	Hear me out, please.  It has been
	intimated to His Majesty that you
	had raised the American Company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young Viscount to command it, and so
	get rid of him.  And, further, that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company, who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action.

			RODERICK
	Thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed!

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	As for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the Irish peerages, His
	Majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
	money, but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
	in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
	will be disappointed.  He left for
	the continent on Tuesday, and may be
	away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

			RODERICK
	I insist upon being allowed to
	appear before His Majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me, to point out my services to the
	government, and to ask when the
	reward, that had been promised me,
	the title held by my ancestors, is
	again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

			LORD WEST
		   (gently)
	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

			RODERICK
	Yes!

			LORD WEST
	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
	point by point.  The King is
	exceedingly averse to make peers, as
	you know.  Your claim, as you call
	them, have been laid before him, and
	His Majesty's gracious reply was,
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions, and merited a
	halter, rather than a coronet.  As
	for withdrawing your support from
	us, you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please.  And, now, as I have a great
	deal of occupation, perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire, or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The news of His Majesty's disregard
	were not long in getting around,
	and, in a very short time, all the
	bills came down upon me together --
	all the bills I had been contracting
	for the years of my marriage.  I
	won't cite their amount; it was
	frightful.  I was bound up in an
	inextricable toil of bills and
	debts, or mortgages and insurances,
	and all the horrible evils attendant
	upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was it my own want of style, or my
	want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
	I was arrived at the height of my
	ambition, but both my skill and my
	luck seemed to be deserting me.
	Everything I touched, crumbled in my
	hands; every speculation I had,
	failed; every agent I trusted,
	deceived me.  My income was saddled
	with hundreds of annuities, and
	thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
	felt the net drawing closer and
	closer around me, and no means to
	extricate myself from its toils.
	All my schemes had turned out
	failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My wife's moody despondency made my
	house and home not over-pleasant;
	hence, I was driven a good deal
	abroad, where as play was the
	fashion in every club, tavern, and
	assembly, I, of course, was obliged
	to resume my old habit, and to
	commence as an amateur those games
	at which I was once unrivaled in
	Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
	was forced to meet my losses by the
	most shameful sacrifices to the
	money-lenders, and was compelled to
	borrow largely upon my wife's
	annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
	life, which was the condition for
	every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

			BROKER
	Your wife's life is as well known
	among the insurance societies in
	London, as any woman in Christendom,
	and, I'm sorry to say there is not
	one of them willing to place another
	policy against her ladyship's life.
	One of them even had the impudence
	to suggest that your treatment of
	the Countess did not render her life
	worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In the midst of my difficulties, I
	promised to buy a little horse for
	my dear little Patrick, which was to
	be a present for his eighth
	birthday, that was now coming on.  I
	may have had my faults, but no man
	shall dare to say of me that I was
	not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a beautiful little animal,
	and stood me in a good sum.  I never
	regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But the horse was a bit wild, and he
	kicked off one of the horse-boys who
	rode him at first, and broke the
	lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But he was a beautiful animal and
	would make a fine horse for Patrick
	after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

			RODERICK
	Timmy, take the injured lad to see
	the doctor, and then bring the horse
	to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
	break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
	it's for little Patrick, and that
	I'll be over to see him next week.

			HORSE-BOY
	Yes, sir.

			RODERICK
	One more thing, and listen well, I
	don't want little Patrick to know
	where the horse is being kept.  It's
	going to be surprise for his
	birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

			PATRICK
	Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

			PATRICK
	Did you buy the horse, papa?

			RODERICK
	Now, just have a little patience, my
	boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
	week.

			PATRICK
	But I will have it on my birthday,
	won't I?

			RODERICK
	Well, we'll just have to wait and
	see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
	a prince; his breeding and manners,
	even at his early age, showed him to
	be worthy of the two noble families
	from whom he was descended, and I
	don't know what high hopes I had for
	the boy, and indulged in a thousand
	fond anticipations as to his future
	success and figure in the world, but
	stern Fate had determined that I
	should leave none of my race behind
	me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

			PATRICK
		   (kissing him)
	Good night, papa.

			RODERICK
	Good night, my little darling.

			PATRICK
	Papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			PATRICK
	One of the boys in the stable told
	Nelly that you've already bought my
	horse, and that it's at Doolan's
	farm, where Mick the groom is
	breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

			RODERICK
		   (angered)
	What the devil?  What kind of fools
	do we have here?  Pottle, who told
	the lad this story?

			HUNT
	I don't know, sir.

			PATRICK
	Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
	thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

			COUNTESS
	Promise me, Patrick, that you will
	not ride the horse except in the
	company of your father.

			PATRICK
		   (unconvincingly)
	I promise, mama.

			RODERICK
	I promise your lordship a good
	flogging if you even so much as go
	to Doolan's farm to see him.

			PATRICK
	Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

			RODERICK
	Yes...?

			VALET
	I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
	Mr. Hunt has something important to
	tell you.

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			HUNT
	I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
	your orders and stolen off to
	Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
	lad's room this morning, his bed was
	empty.  One of the cooks said she
	saw him go away before daybreak.  He
	must have slipped through my room
	while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

			PATRICK
	You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The doctors were called, but what
	does a doctor avail in a contest
	with the grim, invincible enemy?
	Such as came could only confirm our
	despair by their account of the poor
	child's case.  His spine was
	injured, the lower half of him was
	dead when they laid him in bed at
	home.  The rest did not last long,
	God help me!  He remained yet for
	two days with us, and a sad comfort
	it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

			PATRICK
		   (weakly)
	Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
	me for any acts of disobedience I
	have been guilty of towards you.

			COUNTESS
		   (weeping)
	Oh, my little angel, you have done
	nothing for which you need pardon.

			PATRICK
	Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
	see him.

			RODERICK
	Your bother is in America fighting
	the rebels.

			PATRICK
	Is he all right, papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes, he's fine.

			PATRICK
	Brooksy was better than you, papa,
	he used not to swear so, and he
	taught me many good things while you
	were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

			PATRICK
	I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
	love each other, so that we might
	meet again in heaven where Brooksy
	told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, after two days, he died.
	There he lay, the hope of my family,
	the pride of my manhood, the link
	which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
	together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I won't tell you with what splendor
	we buried him, but what avail are
	undertakers' feathers and heralds'
	trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
	nervous, after our blessed boy's
	catastrophe, became more agitated
	than ever, and plunged into devotion
	with so much fervor that you would
	have fancied her almost distracted
	at times.

Countess sees visions.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She imagined she saw visions.  She
	said an angel from heaven told her
	that Patrick's death was a
	punishment to her for her neglect of
	her firstborn.  Then she would
	declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, my financial affairs were
	near to ruin.  I could not get a
	guinea from any money-dealer in
	London.  Our rents were in the hands
	of receivers by this time, and it
	was as much as I could do to get
	enough money from the rascals to pay
	my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
	property was hampered, and often as
	I applied to my lawyers and agents
	for money, would come a reply
	demanding money of me for debts and
	pretended claims which the rapacious
	rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the only person who,
	in my misfortune, remained faithful
	to me -- indeed, she has always
	spoken of me in my true light, as a
	martyr to the rascality of others,
	and a victim of my own generous and
	confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was an invaluable person to me
	in my house, which would have been
	at rack and ruin before, but for her
	spirit of order and management and
	her excellent economy in the
	government of my rapidly dwindling
	household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If anything could have saved me from
	the consequences of villainy in
	others, it would have been the
	admirable prudence of that worthy
	creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She never went to bed until all the
	house was quiet and all the candles
	out; you may fancy that this was a
	matter of some difficulty with a man
	of my habits who had commonly a
	dozen of jovial fellows to drink
	with me every night, and who
	seldom, for my part, went to bed
	sober.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Actions as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Many and many a night, when I was
	unconscious of her attention, has
	that good soul pulled my boots off,
	and seen me laid by my servants snug
	in bed, and carried off the candle
	herself...

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... and been the first in the
	morning, too, to bring me my drink
	of small beer.  It was my mother's
	pride that I could drink more than
	any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother discovered that always,
	before my lady-wife chose to write
	letters to her milliner, she had
	need of lemons to make her drink, as
	she said, and this fact, being
	mentioned to me, kind of set me
	a-thinking.

			RODERICK
		   (reading letter
		    aloud)
	"This day, three years ago, my last
	hope and pleasure in life was taken
	from me, and my dear child was
	called to Heaven.  Where is his
	neglected brother, whom I suffered
	to grow up unheeded by my side, and
	whom the tyranny of the monster to
	whom I am united drove to exile,
	and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
	child is still alive and safe.
	Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
	of a wretched mother, who
	acknowledges her crime, her coldness
	towards you, and now bitterly pays
	for her error!  What sufferings,
	what humiliations have I had to
	endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
	halls.  I should fear poison, but
	then I know the wretch has a sordid
	interest in keeping me alive, and
	that my death would be the signal
	for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
	without my odious, hideous, vulgar
	gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
	purses my every step.  I am locked
	into my chamber at night, like a
	felon, and only suffered to leave it
	when ordered into the presence of my
	lord, to be present at his orgies
	with his boon-companions, and to
	hear his odious converse as he
	lapses into the disgusting madness
	of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was not possible to recover the
	name for whom the note was intended,
	but it was clear that, to add to all
	my perplexities, three years after
	my poor child's death, my wife,
	whose vagaries of temper and wayward
	follies I had borne with for twelve
	years, wanted to leave me.  I
	decided it best not to reveal to her
	ladyship our discovery, that we
	might still intercept and uncover
	further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Yet I was bound to be on my guard
	that she should not give me the
	slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
	the next day.  I set my mother to
	keep sharp watch over the moods of
	her ladyship, and you may be sure
	that her assistance and surveillance
	were invaluable to me.  If I had
	paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
	I should not have been half so well
	served as by the disinterested care
	and watchfulness of my excellent
	mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
	me was a singular one.  Her life was
	passed in a series of crack-brained
	sort of alternation between love and
	hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
	a fortnight, then we should be
	friends for a month together
	sometimes.  One day, I was joking
	her, and asking her whether she
	would take the water again, whether
	she had found another lover, and so
	forth.  She suddenly burst out into
	tears, and, after a while, said to
	me:

			COUNTESS
	Roderick, you know well enough that
	I have never loved but you!  Was I
	ever so wretched that a kind word
	from you did not make me happy?
	Ever so angry, but the least offer
	of good-will on your part did not
	bring me to your side?  Did I not
	give a sufficient proof of my
	affection for you in bestowing one
	of the finest fortunes of England
	upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
	you for the way you have wasted it?
	No, I loved you too much and too
	fondly; I have always loved you.
	From the first moment I saw you, I
	saw your bad qualities, and trembled
	at your violence; but I could not
	help loving you.  I married you,
	though I knew I was sealing my own
	fate in doing so, and in spite of
	reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
	you want from me?  I am ready to
	make any, so you will but love me,
	or, if not, that at least, you will
	gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was in a particularly good humor
	that day, and we had a sort of
	reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, artful hussy has some
	other scheme in her head now.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The old lady was right, and I
	swallowed the bait which her
	ladyship had prepared to entrap me
	as simply as any gudgeon takes a
	hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

			NEWCOMBE
	May I be quite frank with you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, of course.

			NEWCOMBE
	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life, and meditated
	a separation, in which case, she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance,
	and subject them, at any rate, to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation.
	They were quite insistent on this
	point, and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyship's
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital.

			RODERICK
	I see.

			NEWCOMBE
	When I asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyship's
	assurances, they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth, in their
	presence, at their counting-house in
	Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
	they come here, and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to London,
	but they declined, saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to Castle Hackton to
	negotiate, as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties, such as
	Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
	treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, there is some
	artifice.  When once you get into
	that wicked town, you are not safe.
	There are scores of writs out
	against you for debt.  If you are
	taken in London, and thrown into
	prison, your case is hopeless.

			RODERICK
	Mother dear, we are now living off
	our own beef and mutton.  We have to
	watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
	bailiffs without.  There are certain
	situations in which people cannot
	dictate their own terms; and faith,
	we are so pressed now for money,
	that I would sign a bond with old
	Nick himself, if he would provide a
	good round sum.  With this money, we
	can settle our principal debts and
	make a fresh start.

			MOTHER
	Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
	soon as they have you in London,
	they will get the better of my poor
	innocent lad; and the first thing
	that I shall hear of you will be
	that you are in trouble.  You will
	be a victim of your own generous and
	confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

			COUNTESS
	Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
	as long as you are kind to me, as
	you now are.  We can't appear in
	London as we ought; the little money
	you will get will be spent, like all
	the rest has been.  Let us stay here
	and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother and Roderick.

			MOTHER
	Humph!  I believe she is at the
	bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We did not start in state, you may
	be sure.  We did not let the country
	know we were going, or leave notice
	of adieu with our neighbors.  The
	famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
	noble wife traveled in a hack-
	chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When a man is going to the devil,
	how easy and pleasant a journey it
	is!  The thought of the money quite
	put me in a good humor, and my wife,
	as she lay on my shoulder in the
	post-chaise, going to London, said
	it was the happiest ride she had
	taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One night we stayed at Reading.

INT.  INN - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife at dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My lady and I agreed that, with the
	money, we would go to France, and
	wait there for better times, and
	that night, over our supper, formed
	a score of plans both for pleasure
	and retrenchment.  You would have
	thought it was Darby and Joan
	together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
	Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
	blandishments, how happy she seemed
	to be on that night!  What an air of
	innocent confidence appeared in her
	behavior, and what affectionate
	names she called me!  I am lost in
	wonder at the depth of her
	hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
	that an unsuspecting person like
	myself should have been a victim to
	such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We were in London at three o'clock,
	an half-an-hour before the time
	appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
	apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
	in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

			COUNTESS
	Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
	there is danger.  There's time yet,
	let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

			RODERICK
	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

			COUNTESS
	Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

			COUNTESS
	Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

			COUNTESS
	Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
	fool when I married you, and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a base-born adventurer
	-- a fool to bear, without repining,
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered; to allow my property
	to be squandered; to see women as
	base and low-born as yourself...

			TAPEWELL
	For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

			RODERICK
	You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
	said "old" fool.

			BROOKSIDE
	I have no doubt that you said and
	did, sir, everything that a
	blackguard could say or do.  This
	lady is now safe under the
	protection of her relations and the
	law, and need fear your infamous
	persecutions no longer.

			RODERICK
	But you are not safe, and as sure as
	I am a man of honor, I will have
	your heart's blood.

			TAPEWELL
	Take down his words, constables;
	swear the peace against him.

			BROOKSIDE
	I would not sully my sword with the
	blood of such a ruffian.  If the
	scoundrel remains in London another
	day, he will be seized as a common
	swindler.

			RODERICK
	Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

			RODERICK
	Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
	cowardly braggart, come first, if
	you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

			TAPEWELL
	We are not going to seize you!  My
	dear sir, we don't wish to seize
	you; we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country, only leave her
	ladyship in peace.

			BROOKSIDE
	And the country will be rid of such
	a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was no longer the man I was at
	twenty, when I should have charged
	the ruffians, sword in hand, and
	sent at least one of them to his
	account.  I was broken in spirit,
	regularly caught in the toils,
	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman.  Was she relenting at the
	door, when she paused and begged me
	to turn back?  Had she not a
	lingering love for me still?  Her
	conduct showed it, as I came to
	reflect on it.  It was my only
	chance now left in the world, so I
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

			RODERICK
	Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
	you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
	visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

			TAPEWELL
	I have been authorized by Lady
	Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return.  I advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know, as well as I do, that your
	stay in London will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol, as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of England,
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling.  I will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal,
	but if you refuse, the family will
	proceed against you in London, and
	have you arrested.  If you accede, a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
	night to consider this proposal.
	What other choice has a poor, lonely
	and broken-hearted man?  I shall
	take the annuity, and leave the
	country.

			MR. TAPEWELL
	I am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
	I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

			NARRATOR
	Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
	narrative finishes here, for the
	hand of death interrupted the
	ingenious author soon after the
	period which this memoir was
	compiled, after he had lived
	nineteen years an inmate of the
	Fleet Prison, where the prison
	records state he died of delirium
	tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

			NARRATOR
	His faithful old mother joined him
	in his lonely exile, and had a
	bedroom in Fleet Market over the
	way.  She would come and stay the
	whole day with him in prison
	working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

			NARRATOR
	The Countess was never out of love
	with her husband, and, as long as
	she lived, James enjoyed his income
	of 300 pounds per year and was,
	perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
	any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

			NARRATOR
	When her ladyship died, her son
	sternly cut off the annuity,
	devoting the sum to charities,
	which, he said, would make a nobler
	use of it than the scoundrel who had
	enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

			NARRATOR
	When the famous character lost his
	income, his spirit entirely failed.
	He was removed into the pauper's
	ward, where he was known to black
	boots for wealthier prisoners, and
	where he was detected in stealing a
	tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

			NARRATOR
	His mother attained a prodigious old
	age, and the inhabitants of the
	place in her time can record, with
	accuracy, the daily disputes which
	used to take place between mother
	and son, until the latter, from
	habits of intoxication, falling into
	a state of almost imbecility, was
	tended by his tough old parent as a
	baby almost, and would cry if
	deprived of his necessary glass of
	brandy.

          2 INT. MANSION FLAT, LONDON - DAY 2

          A neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated. Framed
          against a large window which looks out over the city, an
          elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the
          phone, on hold.
          On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer;
          the screen reads 'Getting Started ...'

          Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless. She taps her
          fingers on the desk.

                         (ON PHONE)
          Thank you for your patience.
          Your call is -
          A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts.

                         FEMALE VOICE
          Mrs Greenslade, thank you for

                         WAITING -

                         EVELYN

                         (OVERLAPPING)
          Yes, now if you could stay on the
          phone for a moment and talk to
          me, just talk to me. I'm not
          even clear, I don't actually
          understand what it is I'm trying
          to order. Is wireless the same
          as wi-fi? And what do either of
          them have to do with broadband?

                         FEMALE VOICE
          Mrs Greenslade, since the account
          is not in your name, before we
          can make any changes we need to
          speak to the account holder. Can
          I please talk to the account
          holder?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          

                         EVELYN
          What?

                         FEMALE VOICE
          I'm asking if I can speak to the
          account holder. Before we can
          make any changes -

                         EVELYN
          You can't talk to him, no.

                         (BEAT)
          He's dead. He died. There's
          only me.

          3 INT. CORRIDOR/JUDGES CHAMBERS. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 3

          GILES, a judge in full wig and robes, moves quickly down a
          corridor. He passes other judges, going the opposite way.
          He arrives at the office of GRAHAM DASHWOOD, goes in.
          GRAHAM is at his desk. His robes are on a hanger, his wig
          is on a stand beside him.

                         GILES
          We're late.

          4 INT. CORRIDOR. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 4

          Moments later. Graham and Giles walk down the corridor.

                         GRAHAM
          Bloody retirement parties. Hard
          cheese, soft wine, and endless
          speeches. Why do people do that?
          No one ever said about any kind
          of party: it was a wonderful
          occasion, just a shame that the
          speeches were so short.

                         GILES
          it'll be you one day.

                         GRAHAM
          One day very soon.

                         GILES
          You've been saying that for
          years.
          They walk into a large room, full of lawyers.

          4A INT. HALL. INNS OF COURT - CONTINUOUS 4A

          At one end of the hall, a very old JUDGE is giving a very
          dull speech.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           3.

                         JUDGE
          An occasion such as this leads
          one to cast ones mind back to the
          days when I first entered my
          pupillage. I had the very good
          fortune of serving as a junior to
          Mr Justice Stancombe
          Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the
          room. At the old, tired faces.

                         JUDGE (CONT'D)
          . the unwelcome news that I
          would transfer Chambers, bringing
          to mind the old adage a fronte
          praecipitium, a tergo 1upi
          Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
          more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the
          same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.

                         GRAHAM
          This is the day.
          Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
          they are that he's spoken out loud.

                         GILES
          Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          This is the day.
          He turns and walks out.

          5 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 5

          Staff bustle around a busy A & E ward. MURIEL lies on a
          bed in the corridor.
          The Head Nurse, KAREN, rushes past.

                         MURIEL
          Listen, young lady. I want a cup
          of tea, and I want it now.

                         KAREN
          The trolley will be along
          shortly.

                         MURIEL
          How hard d'you have to fall down
          before you get some proper
          attention? Hours I've been lying
          here, and not a single doctor has
          come to see me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           3A.

                         KAREN
          Now that's not quite true, is it
          Mrs Donnelly?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4.

                         KAREN (CONT'D)
          A doctor did try and examine you,
          and you sent him away.

                         MURIEL
          That one?
          She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is
          washing his hands. He's black.

                         MURIEL
          He can wash all he likes, that
          colour's not coming out. I want
          an English doctor.

                         KAREN
          An English doctor? Why didn't
          you say so? I'll get one right
          away.
          She goes away, comes back moments later with a tall,
          handsome doctor. The bad news for Muriel is

                         KAREN (CONT'D)
          This is Dr Ghujarapartidar. And
          this is Mrs Donnelly.

          5A EXT. NEW HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 5A

          A crescent of identical bungalows, part of a brand new
          retirement facility.
          A mobility scooter carrying an elderly resident trundles
          down the road.

          ESTATE AGENT (O.S.)
          .. with an unlimited range of
          leisure opportunities just a
          stone's throw away...

          6 INT. NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY 6

          A young estate agent, EVAN, is showing DOUGLAS and JEAN
          around a very small, and very beige bungalow.

                         EVAN
          So as I say, what you're looking
          at here is very competitively
          priced, you can't get better
          value for your grey pound.
          Another little feature, not
          necessary right now, but give it
          a couple of years

                         (POINTS)
          . rails on the walls to help
          you get around, and down here, a
          panic button in case of a sudden
          fall, brings the Warden running.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4A.

                         JEAN
          What if we fell somewhere else?

                         EVAN
          Sorry?

                         JEAN
          It's just that we might not
          manage to plan our sudden fall in
          the exact corner where the button
          is.

                         EVAN
          Yeah. As I say -

                         

                         

                         

                         
           5.

                         JEAN
          And would it be possible to get
          the rail to go through the middle
          of the room as well?

                         DOUGLAS

                         DARLING

                         JEAN
          To help us get across, not just
          around?

                         DOUGLAS

                         (TO EVAN)
          Could we have a moment, please?
          Thanks. Thanks so much.
          Evan goes.

                         JEAN
          Thirty years in the Civil Service
          and this is all we can afford?

                         DOUGLAS
          Would it help if I apologized
          again?

                         JEAN
          No. But try it anyway.

          7 INT. BAR - NIGHT 7

           JUDITH (40ish) is sitting opposite someone. We don't see
           whom.

                         JUDITH
          And then after that I worked as a
          systems analyst for a few years
          but I just found it so dull, what
          I really wanted was to do
          something that was more creative,
          that matched my ...

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry. On the form they
          asked for our age bracket, and
          the age we wanted to meet . and
          in both cases I ticked 35-45.
          Now we see the man she's talking to. It's NORMAN. He's
          dapper, nice looking. And at least 70.

                         NORMAN
          That's right, yes. So did I.
          They're at a speed dating evening. Numbered tables, etc.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          Anyway, don't stop. Something

                         MORE CREATIVE

                         

                         

                         

                         
           6.

                         JUDITH
          How old are you?

                         NORMAN
          Early 40's.

                         JUDITH
          D'you mean you were born in the
          early 40's?

                         NORMAN
          Judy, I know what you're asking -

                         JUDITH
          It's Judith.

                         NORMAN
          Judith. And trust me, I've still
          got it.
          The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move
          along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking
          back.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          I just can't find anyone that
          wants it.
          Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And
          looks crestfallen at what's on offer.

          8 INT/EXT. BEDROOM/STAIRS/HALL. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY 8

          MADGE is in her bedroom. She's arguing with her son-in-law
          CRAIG. Madge's suitcases are by the door.

                         CRAIG
          This is crazy. You're crazy.
          You can't just up and leave like
          this.

                         MADGE
          And yet if you watch me, that's
          exactly what you'll see happen.
          She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's
          daughter JESSICA is on the landing.

                         JESSICA
          What's going on?

                         CRAIG
          Your mother's lost it.

                         JESSICA
          My mother never had it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           7.

                         CRAIG
          Talk to her. She doesn't listen
          to me.

                         MADGE
          Nobody listens to you.
          She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow.

                         MADGE (CONT'D)

                         (TO JESSICA)
          It's one of the great mysteries
          of life that someone so vibrant
          and fascinating as my daughter
          should choose to spend her life
          with this fraction of a man.

                         JESSICA
          I still don't understand what's
          going on.

                         CRAIG
          I just asked her to babysit. And
          now she says she's leaving.
          They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children,
          LIAM and KATIE, are watching.

                         JESSICA
          But you love babysitting.

                         MADGE
          I loved it last night.

                         LIAM
          We had pizza and stayed up late.

                         MADGE
          And the night before.

                         KATIE
          We had Chinese and stayed up
          late.

                         LIAM
          If you don't go, tonight we could
          do a curry.

                         MADGE
          It's tempting, my darlings, but
          you know why I must leave.

                         LIAM
          We know.

                         KATIE
          (to her parents)
          Being here is stopping her
          finding a husband.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           8.

                         CRAIG
          Another one?

          LIAM AND KATIE
          Bye Granny.

                         MADGE
          Don't let the buggers get you
          down.
          Madge turns to go.

                         CRAIG
          How many husbands have you had,
          anyway?
          She turns back, smiles.

                         MADGE
          Including my own?
          Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi.

                         JESSICA
          Mother? Mother!

          9 INT/EXT. TAXI - DAY 9

           Moments later. Madge climbs into the back of the cab.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          Name the place, darling. Where
          are you going?
          Madge smiles.

                         MADGE
          I have absolutely no idea.

          10 INT. MANSION FLAT - DAY 10

          Evelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living
          room. Her son CHRISTOPHER is there. And her lawyer

          HAROLD.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          There's no other way There
          just isn't. Harold told us this 
          three months ago.

                         HAROLD
          And I'm afraid matters have only
          got worse.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           8A.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          We can't wait any longer. We
          need to put this flat on the
          market, and at least make a start
          at paying off Dad's debts.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           9.
          Christopher turns to Harold.

                         CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)
          I've talked it through with Polly
          and the boys, and of course we 
          all agreed. Ma will move in with 
          us. 

                         HAROLD
          I think that's best, Evelyn.
          It's what Hugh would've wanted.
          They wait for confirmation from Evelyn. None comes. 

                         CHRISTOPHER
          Good. Settled. End of
          discussion.

                         EVELYN
          That's what your father used to
          say. 

                         CHRISTOPHER

                         MA - 

                         EVELYN
          When there'd never really been 
          any discussion at all. 

                         CHRISTOPHER
          I want to look after things for 
          you. 

                         EVELYN 
          Like he did for forty years 

                         CHRISTOPHER 
          Yes. 

                         EVELYN
          And look how that turned out. 
          She turns to Harold 

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          How can any of us know what Hugh
          would've wanted? And would he
          have seen fit to tell us anyway?

                         (BEST)
          Obviously the flat has to be
          sold.
          (Best, then to Christopher)
          And you're very kind. And dear
          Polly. But no, I won't be coming
          to live with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            9A.

          11 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 11

          Muriel has now been transferred to a ward. She is
          listening to DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR.

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly.
          It's not a difficult operation.

                         MURIEL
          Easy for you to say, you're not
          having it.

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          Regardless. You do need a new
          hip.

                         MURIEL
          I'm not getting it from you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          2nd Green Revisions I0/01/11 10.

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          Not me personally, no.

                         MURIEL
          Not any of your lot.

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          I see.

                         MURIEL
          So when do I have the operation?

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting
          list for at least six months.

                         MURIEL
          At my age, I can't plan that far
          ahead. I don't even buy green
          bananas.

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          There is another way. Our
          hospital trust is funding a new
          pilot scheme, that will enable us
          to out-source you to another
          hospital, where they can perform
          the procedure almost immediately,
          and at a fraction of the cost.

                         MURIEL
          Is it local?

                         DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
          That depends how you define
          local.

          12 INT. EVELYN'S FLAT/CHRISTOPHER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 12

          Evelyn is on the phone to her son Christopher. They're
          both sitting at computers. Evelyn's new-found dexterity is
          impressive.
          Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full.

                         CHRISTOPHER

                         (ON PHONE)
          When did you get a computer?

                         EVELYN
          How far along is the progress
          bar? The strip at the bottom
          that tells you -

                         CHRISTOPHER
          I know what it is. What are you
          showing me anyway?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           11.
          The webpage has come up. It's a picture of a beautiful old
          building. And underneath is written 'THE BEST EXOTIC

          MARIGOLD HOTEL'.
          As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous
          Indian voice.

                         INDIAN VOICE
          'Come and spend your autumn years
          in an Indian palace with the
          sophistication of an English
          country manor. Steeped in the
          tradition of the Raj, tucked away
           on the outskirts of Jaipur .'

          13 INT. INTERNET CAFE - DAY 13

          The mellifluous tones continue. Madge mouths the words to
          herself as she scans the same web-page.

                         INDIAN VOICE
          it exudes historical
          ambience and is graced with
           breathtaking surroundings .'

          14 INT. SALON - DAY 14

          Jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at
          the hairdressers. Her stylist ABI listens to her reading a
          computer printout for the same hotel. Which looks classy,
          elegant, and welcoming.
          Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's.

                         JEAN

                         (READING)
          'Lofty terraces, open courtyards,
          domes, arches and canopied
          balconies transport one back in
          time.'

                         ABI
          I wouldn't mind going there
          myself.

          15 EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 15

          In the background, a train rumbles along the Piccadilly
          Line towards Heathrow.
          Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend
          SIMON. Douglas is lining up a tricky putt.

                         SIMON
          There won't be any golf courses.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           12.

                         DOUGLAS
          Just as well. I can't afford the
          green fees.

                         SIMON
          But a retirement home?
          Douglas misses his putt.

                         DOUGLAS
          It's a luxury development, where
          all the residents are in their
          golden years.

                         SIMON
          Like the Costa Brava.

                         DOUGLAS
          Yes. But with more elephants.
          Simon holes out.

          16 INT. JUDGES CHAMBERS - DAY 16

          Graham, the judge, is in his office. It's nearly empty;
          his entire life is being packed away.
          His friend Giles watches him put more things in boxes.

                         GILES
          How long have we known each
          other? And you've never once
          talked about India.

                         GRAHAM
          D'you want these books?

                         GILES
          You might need them again.
          Graham smiles at him, calls out.

                         GRAHAM
          Mrs Megson!
          His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in.

                         MRS MEGSON
          Sir?
          Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to
          her.

                         GRAHAM
          I want you to have this.

                         MRS MEGSON
          Are you sure?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           13.

                         GRAHAM
          Absolutely. There's a slight
          crack on the bottom. But I think
          you might know something about
          that already.
          Mrs Megson goes.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          I used to live there. A long
          time ago.

          17 INT. BASEMENT BEDSIT. EARLS COURT - DAY 17

          A bedsit. Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished.
          Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone.
          We don't see who.
          Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old
          battery radio.

                         NORMAN
          I have to go. I do. And I could
          say I wish you'd come, but I've
          never lied to you. We both know
          I need more than you can offer.
          We know that. Don't we?
          We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient
          dachshund.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          (to the dog)
          Don't make that face at me.
          Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door.

                         MRS JELLINEK
          (to her dog)
          You. Upstairs.
          The dog hops off the chair, and leaves. Norman watches him
          go.
          MRS JELLINEK (cont'd)
          Any warm clothes you have use for
          no more, I take them. And not
          forget to leave keys when you go.
          She leaves. Norman is left alone.

                         NORMAN
          I'll miss you too.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            14.

          18 EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 18

          The district ambulance driver, JACKSON, is pushing Muriel
          in a wheelchair across a housing estate.

                         MURIEL
          You know who'll be there, don't
          you? Indians. Loads of them, A
          sea of brown faces and black
          hearts, all greasy haired and
          reeking of spices. Never see one
          on their own, do you? No,
          becuase they hunt in packs. All
          the better to rob me blind and -

                         JACKSON
          You know what? You can take it
          from here.

                         MURIEL
          You're supposed to see me into my
          flat. That's what they said.

                         JACKSON
          My wife is from Mumbai.
          He heads off. Muriel shouts after him.

                         MURIEL
          No good moaning to me, mate. You
          married her!
          But he's gone.
          Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground.

          19 EXT. PASSENGER DROP-OFF. STANSTED AIRPORT - EVENING 19

          A reluctant Christopher is pushing a trolley carrying
          Evelyn's cases to the terminal.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          You're sure your tickets are in
          order?

                         EVELYN
          They should be. The hotel paid
          for them. I'm sure they'd
          rather have us there than not.
          And its fantastically cheap for
          the first three months.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          I wonder why.
          They walk on in silence.

                         CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)
          How will we know you're alright?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           15.

                         EVELYN
          I'll call. They do have phones
          there, you know. Or you can
          just read my blog.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          Your what?

                         EVELYN
          On the interweb. You can log in
          whenever you like, read my news.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          I just hope the first item will
          be announcing your return. I
          don't suppose they'll be paying
          for the journey back...?
          Evelyn stops. They've reached the terminal.

                         EVELYN
          Could you please, before I go,
          say one thing that is supportive?
          Because I've never done anything
          like this before.

                         CHRISTOPHER
          Without Dad, you never did
          anything at all. And i don't
          think you'll be able to cope.

                         EVELYN
          Well. I suppose we'll find out,
          won't we?
          They head into the building.

          20 INT. CHECK-IN AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 20

          Madge is at the First Class Check-In desk.

                         MADGE
          And the connecting flight to
          Jaipur is first class too?
          The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport.

                         MADGE (CONT'D)
          I tell you, it's tough to get
          upgraded nowadays. I had to
          flirt so hard with the travel
          agent, it was practically phone
          sex.

          21 INT. SECURITY AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 21

          The light is fading.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           15A.
          Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a
          female Security Guard.

                         NORMAN
          Come on. Thorough as you like
          Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          We'd like to take a look in this
          bag, Madam, if you don't mind.
          He lifts the bag onto a table. It's heavier than he
          thought.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           16.
          SECURITY GUARD (cont'd)
          What you got in here anyway?
          He opens the bag, stares in astonishment.

                         MURIEL
          PG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars
          of Marmite. Thirty one packets
          of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled
          onions. Pickled eggs. And
          pickle.

                         SECURITY GUARD
          No liquids on the plane.

                         MURIEL
          What does that mean?

                         SECURITY GUARD
          It means you can't take the
          pickled onions. Or the pickled
          eggs.

                         (BEAT)
          The pickle's fine.

          22 INT. BOARDING GATE. AIRPORT - EVENING/NIGHT 22

          The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the
          gate, waiting to board.
          Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end
          of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and
          Jean are already sitting there.
          Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats
          away.
          Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty
          place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end.
          He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits.
          Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between
          Graham and Douglas.
          And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of
          their common fate.
          The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs
          them.

          23 EXT. RUNWAY. INDIA - DAWN 23

          The plane cruises down through a stunning sunset, and lands
          at Delhi Airport.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            17.

          24 INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, DELHI - DAY 24

          Evelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an
          escalator. Madge is a few steps up.

                         JEAN
          Obviously one's read one's
          Kipling, but we view this as an
          opportunity to explore another
          culture, as well as making new
          friends. And a retired judge is
          just the class of guest one was
          hoping for, isn't it Douglas?

                         DOUGLAS
          I'm sorry?

                         GRAHAM

                         (TO EVELYN)
          And is this your first time in
          India?

                         JEAN
          You don't seem like an
          experienced traveller.

                         EVELYN
          I'm not. Although one has read
          one's guidebooks.
          Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas
          hides his. And Madge sees it all.
          As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by
          Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is
          pushing Muriel's wheelchair.

                         NORMAN
          Norman Cousins.

                         MADGE
          Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure.

                         NORMAN
          Play your cards right, it could
          be.
          Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.

                         AIRPORT ANNOUNCER
          Ladies and gentlemen, we regret
          to inform you that owing to bad
          weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has
          been cancelled. The airline is
          happy to arrange

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         
            18.

          25 INT. AIRPORT. DELHI - DAY 25

          Hours later. The airport is deserted, except for the
          Marigold Hotel party, who sit slumped and exhausted on
          another row of seats, with Muriel's wheelchair at the other
          end.
          After a moment, Graham says

                         GRAHAM
          Alright. Plan B.

          26 INT. DELHI AIRPORT - DAY 26

          Moments later. They're all moving briskly through the hi-
          tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building.

                         JEAN
          Of course it's a good idea. Who
          can you trust if not a High Court
          Judge?

                         DOUGLAS
          And this way we see more of the
          country.
          Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.

                         NORMAN
          (leaning down, to

                         MURIEL)
          If anyone asks, say you're my
          mother. I don't want people to
          think we're together.

                         MURIEL
          In your dirty dreams.

                         JEAN
          Douglas, these are not words that
          often pass my lips, but you may
          actually be right. The country
          seems to be rather more civilised
          than one originally thought.

          27 EXT. DELHI BUS STATION - EVENING 27

          Moments later. Our heroes are in the middle of an
          extraordinary scene. Stifling heat, deafening noise; the
          chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life.
          They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage
          handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention.
          Evelyn looks a little shocked. Jean is traumatized, a
          handkerchief to her face.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           19.
          Graham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a
          fistful of tickets.

                         GRAHAM
          (shouting over the din)
          The bus will drop us in the
          centre of town. We can take tuk-
          tuks the rest of the way!
          They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus.
          It's absolutely rammed. People are practically hanging out
          of the windows.

                         MADGE
          There's not enough room.

                         GRAHAM
          It's time to prove the first and
          only rule of India: there's
          always room.
          He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the
          back. She stops, for a moment, looks around her.

                         EVELYN
          What larks, Pip.
          Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles.

                         DOUGLAS
          Let's hope so.

          28 EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING 28

          Muriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus,
          which is screaming down the six-lane highway. A huge tower
          of luggage is piled precariously on the roof.
          The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even
          cows overtaking each other.
          The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which
          is overtaking some slower vehicles. As the truck pulls back
          into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling
          towards them on the wrong carriageway.
          Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream...

                         NORMAN

          NOOOOOOO... . U
          At the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside
          lane. The Indians on the bus take absolutely no notice.

          29 INT. BUS - EVENING 29

          Norman is grinning from ear to ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           20.

                         NORMAN
          I'm loving this!
          Evelyn is sitting next to Madge.

                         EVELYN
          A few months ago I was organising
          the church flowers.

                         MADGE
          Are you struggling with the
          feeling you're not in control of
          your circumstances?

                         EVELYN
          A little.

                         MADGE
          You know what the shortest prayer
          in the world is?

                         EVELYN
          No.

                         MADGE
          Fuck it.
          Evelyn laughs.

                         MADGE (CONT'D)
          You're not doing the church
          flowers any more. May as well
          enjoy the ride.
          Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a
          picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him
          some food.
          Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily.

                         JEAN
          Are you insane? "Avoid all food
          not from a reputable vendor, it
          will have been washed with impure
          water."
          Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.

                         DOUGLAS
          It's just a sandwich.

                         JEAN
          Marvellous. Then I'll have the
          ham, cheese, and streptococcus,
          please. Or perhaps the bacteria,
          lettuce and tomato.
          Douglas turns to Muriel.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           21.

                         DOUGLAS
          Would you like some of this? I
          believe it's aloo ka paratha.

                         MURIEL
          If I can't pronounce it, I'm not
          eating it.
          The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another
          collision looms.

          30 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 30

          The last of the light. The bus moves on through a beautiful
          landscape.

          31 INT. BUS - NIGHT 31

          Everyone is asleep, or trying to sleep.
          Except Muriel. She reaches into her bag, and carefully
          removes a biscuit. She surreptitiously lifts it to her
          mouth, and starts to chew.
          Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder. But Evelyn
          is still awake, as is Graham.

                         EVELYN
          How long since you were here?

                         GRAHAM
          Forty years.

                         EVELYN
          As long as I was married.

                         (BEAT)
          He died recently. My husband.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm sorry.

                         EVELYN
          D'you think we're going to be
          alright?

                         GRAHAM
          God, don't ask me. I'm more
          scared than you are.
          They both smile, sit in silence for a bit.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Yes. I think it's going to be
          extraordinary.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            22.

          32 EXT. BUS - DAWN 32

          The sun rises. A beautiful, pearly dawn.
          The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur. Below,
          the city shimmers in the heat. It's a magnificent sight.

          EVELYN (O.S.)
          What exactly is a tuk-tuk?

          33 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAWN 33

          Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing
          forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much
          dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning
          streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world
          racing past them.
          A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his
          girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari
          billows out behind her. Douglas and Evelyn both watch her,
          struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality.

          34 EXT. STREET/GARDEN PATH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34

          The tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge,
          exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at
          the Marigold Hotel. Once a beautiful building, once
          possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of
          being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs.
          Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the
          ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with
          crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding. A huge old tree towers
          over an untended garden, its branches poking into the
          windows of the building.

          34A EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34A

          A young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the
          arrival below: SONNY KAPOOR (early 20's).
          He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races
          off across the rooftop.

          34B EXT. GARDEN PATH/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34B

          Dazed and horrified, the travellers wander up the pathway.
          A cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden
          by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks
          to collect their luggage.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            23.

          34C EXT. STAIRWAY/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34C

          Sonny clatters down the steep steps, and comes tearing out
          onto a verandah, as the travellers arrive in the courtyard
          below. He spreads his arms wide.

                         SONNY
          Welcome to India!!!
          They stare up at him.

          35 EXT/INT. COURTYARD/HALLWAY.BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 35

          The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat
          delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if
          it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up
          haphazardly.
          Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building,
          towards her room.

                         SONNY
          This is a building of the utmost
          character, which means that
          perhaps not everything will
          function in the way you expect it
          to. But as the manager and chief
          executive supervising officer of
          the Marigold Hotel, I can tell
          you with great pride that the
          building has stood for centuries,
          and will stand for many more, in
          100% shipshape condition. Please
          follow me, carefully avoiding
          that naughty stone there
          round this corner, leading us
          most successfully all the way to
          . your bedroom!
          The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully
          decorated. But there's no door.

                         MADGE
          Where?

                         SONNY
          Here. In here.

                         MADGE
          My dear man. Rooms have doors.
          What you're showing me here is an
          alcove.

                         SONNY
          The door is coming soon, most
          definitely.

                         MADGE
          How soon?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           24.

                         SONNY
          Let us not concern ourselves with
          details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather
          than speaking of doors, we should
          instead take pleasure in the
          freedom to roam.

                         MADGE
          Does your room have a door?

                         SONNY
          Oh yes.

                         MADGE
          Then that's where I'll be
          staying.

          36 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 36

          Douglas and Jean arrive at their room. Douglas goes in
          through the arched doorway, promptly comes back out again.

                         DOUGLAS
          Bird in the room! Bird in the
          room!
          Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are
          flying around in some panic.

          37 EXT/INT. VERANDAH/BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 37

          Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in.
          The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the
          furniture is covered in sheets.
          As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all
          the sheets off, and runs out again.

          38 EXT/INT. BEDROOMS/TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 38

          Muriel wheels herself towards her room. Standing inside is
          a male nurse, AJIT.
          Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into
          his room.

                         MURIEL
          There's an Indian in there!
          Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but
          comfortable and pleasant.
          He looks around with satisfaction.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            25.

          39 EXT. STAIRWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 39

           Norman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room. He
          stops, catches his breath.

          40 EXT. TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 40

          Ajit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel.

                         MURIEL
          My what?

                         AJIT
          Your physiotherapist. To help
          with your recovery after the
          operation.

                         MURIEL
          You're not touching me.

                         AJIT
          Traditionally that is how
          physiotherapy is practised.

          41 EXT. ROOF, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 41

          Norman comes out onto the roof of the hotel. His room is
          right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin. A bed,
          but not much else. The trees poke in through the open
          window.
          He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a
          hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view.

                         NORMAN
          This'll do.

          42 INT. RECEPTION - DAY 42

          Jean is confronting Sonny.

                         JEAN
          I want to stay at the other
          hotel, the one in the brochure.

                         SONNY
          Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be
          amazed. This is that very
          building!

                         JEAN
          You've Photoshopped it!

                         SONNY
          I have offered a vision of the
          future.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           26.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Of course I had hoped that by now
          it would be the present. But in
          India we have a saying:
          everything will be alright in the
          end. So if it is not alright,
          then it is not yet the end.

                         JEAN
          What will start to make this
          alright is for you to give us a
          refund.

                         SONNY
          Of course if that is what you
          desire, you must have it.
          Absolutely no problem, I will
          refund you completely.

                         JEAN
          You will? Straight away?

                         SONNY
          Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I
          most definitely will. Straight
          away in three months.

          43 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 43

          Graham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of
          Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during
          the Raj, official documents yellowing with age.
          He picks up a photograph, looks at it.
          From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapist

          AJIT (O.S.)
          a stay of five days and it is
          done under general anaesthesia.
          A hip replacement usually takes
          only two hours

          44 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 44

          Ajit's explanation continues. Muriel is trying not to
          panic.

                         AJIT
          Your surgeon will remove the top
          end of the thigh bone, and insert
          an artificial bone instead. A
          most routine procedure.

                         MURIEL
          Have you got a marker pen on you?

                         AJIT
          Why?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           27.

                         MURIEL
          I want to mark it. So you don't
          take the wrong hip.

          45 EXT. UPPER VERANDAH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 45

          Douglas is on his way down the stairs.
          Evelyn comes out of her bedroom.

                         EVELYN
          Oh, hello.

                         DOUGLAS
          Is everything alright?

                         EVELYN
          I was just going to find the
          manager.

                         DOUGLAS
          I'm afraid he's dealing with my
          wife. Or vice versa.

                         EVELYN
          I promised I'd call my son, to
          tell him I'd arrived, and -

                         DOUGLAS
          And the phone in your room
          doesn't work. May I?

          45A INT. EVELYN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 45A

           Douglas picks up the very old-style phone. Evelyn is
          watching.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          Now, did you try jiggling it a
          bit?

                         EVELYN
          Yes, did that.

                         DOUGLAS
          Did you kind of bang it lightly
          on the desk a few times?

                         EVELYN
          That too.

                         DOUGLAS
          Hmm.
          He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the
          receiver carefully. And blows on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           28.

                         EVELYN
          How did you come to be here? In
          India.

                         DOUGLAS
          I invested our - well, my -
          retirement money in our
          daughter's internet company. She
          assured me that as soon as the
          start-up actually started up, and
          the conversion from virtual to
          actual proved sufficiently
          viable, then she would be able to
          pay it all back.

                         EVELYN
          I'm not sure I understand what
          most of those words mean.

                         DOUGLAS
          It turns out neither did she.
          Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver
          to his ear.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          There you are. Good as new.

                         EVELYN
          Really?

                         DOUGLAS
          No, of course not. I've got no
          idea what I'm doing.
          Evelyn bursts out laughing.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          Now, would you like me to not fix
          that chair? Because I can do
          that too.

          45B EXT. STAIRWAY. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 45B

          The houseboys are struggling with the unequal task of
          pulling Muriel's wheelchair, with Muriel in it, up the
          narrow steps.

          SONNY (O.S.)
          In honour of your arrival, a
          special welcome British roast for
          you all!

          46 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD - NIGHT 46

          A group of mismatched table and chairs, that constitute the
          dining area of the hotel.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           29.
          Sonny is serving up a meal. His guests, wearing garlands
          of marigolds, listen politely.

                         SONNY
          .Cooked lovingly by myself and
          my most loyalist factotum and
          helper, Young Wasim ...
          He points to YOUNG WASIM. Who is about 80, and is sitting
          in the corner, fast asleep.

                         MADGE
          Roast what?

                         SONNY
          A wonderful taste of Blighty.

                         MADGE
          Roast what?

                         SONNY
          Roast goat curry.

                         DOUGLAS
          Yes please.

                         JEAN
          So the upshot is that he's spent
          all our money getting us here,
          and we can't leave till he's made
          some more.
          Muriel has arrived at her table.

                         SONNY
          Gentle friends, you have found
          your way to this place,
          bequeathed to me by my beloved
          father, that I have raised from
          the ruins of his broken dreams,
          and renamed The Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel For The Elderly
          And Beautiful. Yes, I use the
          words most deliberately...
          Norman is not looking very well at all. Sonny doesn't
          notice, keeps on going.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          .You have all heard the chimes
          at midnight, and long in tooth
          have youbecome. Who knowshow
          many daysyou have left?But we
          are mosthonoured that youhave
          chosen tospend that time with
          us.
          Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his
          chair onto the floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           30.
          General panic. Everybody crowds round, but no one knows
          what to do.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Let me through, please. My
          brother is a doctor.
          He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels
          for a pulse.
          Everybody waits. And then

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          This man is dead.
          An appalled silence.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Please, we must cover his face.
          We should preserve his dignity at
          this terrible moment.
          Madge looks around. All there is is a napkin. She passes
          it Sonny, who lays it over the face of Norman.
          Who promptly coughs.

                         DOUGLAS
          He just coughed. I heard him
          cough!

                         EVELYN
          He moved! He's alive!

                         MADGE
          He's fainted, that's all.
          Sonny shakes his watch next to his ear. It's stopped.
          Norman sits up.

                         NORMAN
          What's going on? Did I nod off?
          Everyone crowds round Norman, helps lift him back up.
          Except Muriel. She just stares at them all.

                         MURIEL
          Hell. I'm in hell.

          47 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 47

          The sun rises. A washer-man bicycles up to the hotel, a
          load of clean sheets balanced on his handlebars.
          Shopkeepers on the street are beginning to set out their
          wares.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           31.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Day Nine. Old habits die easier
          than we think, and new ones form.

          48 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 48

          Evelyn is typing - hunt and peck - at her computer. Beside
          her, the classified pages of the local newspaper.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          No longer do I reach out in the
          morning for Radio 4. My news
          comes instead from the Jaipur

                         HERALD

          49 EXT. STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 49

          A sign reads: 'THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL FOR THE

          ELDERLY AND BEAUTIFUL - OPEN FOR BUSINESS.'
          Sonny affixes a sticker: 'NOW WITH GUESTS!'

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          . Soon I might even grow
          accustomed to the storm of car
          horns and vendors.

          50 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 50

          The main road in Jaipur is chaotically busy. Crowds,
          bikes, cows, dust, noise, and laughter.
          Sonny's battered old car has broken down. Madge is in the
          front seat, Douglas and Jean in the back.
          Sonny is aiming a couple of kicks at the engine.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Can there be anywhere else in the
          world that is such an assault on
          the senses?

          51 EXT/INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE, JAIPUR - DAY 51

          An office out of a Kafka novel; cloth bags containing files
          are piled all around the room, floor to ceiling.
          Graham is seated at a desk, in front of a sober official.
          He is filling in a form.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Those who know the country of old
          just go about their business.
          But nothing can prepare the
          uninitiated for this riot of
          noise and colour ...

                         

                         

                         

                         
            32.

          Norman seems less interested in the astonishing geometric
          devices of the ancient observatory than in the female
          tourists who have come to see them...

          52 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 52

          The chaos and din of the street is even more mind-boggling.
          Madge now has the bonnet up, and is studying the engine.
          Douglas stands in the street, staring in wonderment around
          him.
          Inside the car, Jean looks utterly traumatized, shrinking
          lower in her seat as a horde of kids swarm at the windows,
          shouting, wheedling, gesticulating. Sonny does his best to
          wave them away.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          ... for the heat, the motion, the
          perpetual teeming crowds. Sonny
          is conducting his own personal
          assault on our senses

          53 INT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 53

          The guests look on with trepidation, as another meal is
          laid before them.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          with the flow of exotic
          dishes he demands daily from the
          kitchen. Mooli Moong Dal.
          Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht.
          Paneer Methi Chaman ...
          As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their
          bathrooms; a litany of doors closing
          Until Norman.
          EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Mutton Vindaloo ...
          Norman lies on his bed, reading the Kama Sutra.
          He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration
          more intently.

          54 INT. HOSPITAL, JAIPUR - DAY 54

          The hospital puts the NHS to shame. It's hi-tech, bright,
          and spanking clean.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           33.
          Sonny pushes Muriel through the doors of the lobby. The
          reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid
          with fear.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Initially you're overwhelmed.
          But gradually you realise: it's
          like a wave. Resist, and you'll
          be knocked over ...
          Sonny is in discussion with some doctors.
          Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the
          window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away
          down the path...
          EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)
          Dive into it, and you'll swim out
          the other side.

          55 EXT/INT. STREET/ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 55

          Madge is exchanging some coins with a street trader in
          return for a mobile phone.
          In her room, Madge scans a phone directory, and dials a
          number.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          This is a new and different
          world.

          56 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 56

          Evelyn is finishing her blog. She picks up the paper,
          checks something.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          The challenge is to cope with it.

          57 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 57

          Evelyn is coming down the path to the gate.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          And not just cope ... but thrive.

          58 EXT. STREET, JAIPUR - DAY 58

          Evelyn is walking down a rough street on the outskirts of
          the city. Kids are everywhere, laughing, shouting, doing
          tricks, begging.
          Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           34.

                         EVELYN
          Please, can anyone direct me to
          this address?
          Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the
          kids can read. An older boy finally points. Suddenly
          there's lots of pointing.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Thank you.
          She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I don't . I don't
          really have much ...
          She gives them the contents of her pockets.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Alright? Alright now? Goodbye.
          She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of
          kids walks with her. In fact, the group seems to be
          growing exponentially. She looks like the Pied Piper.

          59 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 59

          Douglas is getting ready to go out. Jean clearly isn't.

                         DOUGLAS
          Graham was talking about this
          marvellous temple. I thought you
          might want to come with me.

                         JEAN
          I'm your wife. Have we met?

                         DOUGLAS
          You'd really rather stay here all
          day?

                         JEAN
          Given the alternative, yes.

                         DOUGLAS
          When I walk out in the morning,
          the street kids all smile at me.

                         JEAN
          Because you give them money.

                         DOUGLAS
          One does this trick where he
          holds his hands out in front of
          himself, and then swings through
          his own arms. Got to be worth a
          rupee or two.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           34A.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)

                         (BEAT)
          I'll go on my own then.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            35.

          60 EXT. CHAND POLE STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 60

          The road is absolutely rammed; with cars, bikes and
          rickshaws. All honking horns, all seemingly headed in
          different directions.
          Evelyn has somehow made it to the central reservation. She
          takes a deep breath, and plunges into the maze of traffic,
          heading for the other side.

          61 EXT. RICKSHAW. SUBURBAN ROAD, JAIPUR - DAY 61

          Graham is in a rickshaw. The rickshaw driver, PRAVESH, is
          driving it through a neighborhood in transition. Skeletal
          structures of a new India rise above the houses.

          61A EXT. BUILDING SITE/STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 61A

          Some kids playing cricket.
          The rickshaw weaves its way through them and comes to a
          halt.
          Graham gets out, and stands in the street, dwarfed by a
          huge modern building, some months away from completion.

                         GRAHAM
          This can't be right, surely?

                         PRAVESH
          I am thinking so, saab.

                         GRAHAM
          But there were houses all along
          here . these were homes.

                         PRAVESH
          I can take you some other
          place..?

                         GRAHAM
          No. That'll do for now. Thank
          you.
          He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away.
          Graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket. One of
          them, SANJAY, is batting.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Excuse me. There used to be

                         HOUSES HERE

                         SANJAY
          All knocked down.

                         GRAHAM
          And the people? The families?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           36.

                         SANJAY
          They move.
          Graham nods, turns to look at the giant structure that has
          taken over, then turns back.

                         GRAHAM
          Don't grip so tightly with your
          right hand.
          Sanjay looks puzzled.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          On the bat. The right is just a
          guide. Keep your left elbow
          high, play down the line of your
          arm, and then you'll hit through

                         THE BALL
          Sanjay looks at him, squinting in the sun.

          62 INT. CORRIDOR. HOSPITAL - DAY 62

          Ajit is wheeling Muriel through the hospital.

                         MURIEL
          When can I go back to England?

                         AJIT
          As soon as you can walk onto the
          plane. How does the hip feel?

                         MURIEL
          They must have got lucky.

                         AJIT
          It's strange. I think the more
          operations they perform, the
          luckier they get.
           He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting
           Ajit's joke.

          63 EXT. MARKET. BACK STREETS - DAY 63

          Evelyn is still searching for the right address. She's
          turned off the main road, and is heading down a narrow side
          streets. The city has become denser, and the walls seem to
          have closed in.
          She pushes her way through the crowded market.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            37.

          63A EXT. PASSAGE/COURTYARD - DAY 63A

          Uncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly
          finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with
          makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly
          threatening.
          As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that
          she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and
          people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled
          into their home.
          Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face
          to another.

                         EVELYN
          I'm so sorry. I didn't realise -
          She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with
          cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She
          goes to pick them up.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry...
          A man is staring at her: SURESH.

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get
          to this address.

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN
          Do you understand me? Can you
          help me find this place?

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN
          Is that yes you understand, or
          yes you can help me?

                         SURESH
          Yes.
          Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and
          the tension is broken slightly.

                         EVELYN
          Let's go with both, shall we?

                         

                         

                         

                         
            38.

          63B EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 63B

          Suresh's flatbed trike is rolling down the street, piled
          impossibly high with bundles of brightly-coloured textiles.
          On the back, enthroned in the fabric, is Evelyn.

          64 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 64

          Graham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good,
          too. He whacks a ball off into the distance.

                         GRAHAM

                         (TRIUMPHANT)

          YES!
          A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half-
          walks to the other end, then turns for a second run,
          breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets
          ready for the next delivery.
          It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for
          years.

                         SANJAY
          Give me the ball. I can take
          him.
          He turns cheerily to Graham.

                         SANJAY (CONT'D)
          Down is where you're going,
          Uncle.

                         GRAHAM
          Come on. Do your worst.
          They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to
          the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to
          bowl.
          As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems
          to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to
          reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys,
          frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave
          Sanjay's hand.
          Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and
          is bowled.

                         SANJAY
          That's what I'm talking about! I
          felt the need, the need for -
          Graham still hasn't moved.

                         SANJAY (CONT'D)
          Are you alright, Uncle?
          Graham finds his voice at last.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           39.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

          65 EXT. STREET/CALL CENTRE BUILDING - DAY 65

          Suresh brakes, stops outside a glass-clad high-rise
          building.

                         SURESH
          Yes.
          Suresh helps Evelyn down off the back.

                         EVELYN
          Thank you.

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN
          This is it?

                         SURESH
          Yes.

                         EVELYN
          Then thank you. You're very
          kind.

                         SURESH
          Yes.
          He rides off. Evelyn looks nervously up at the building.

          66 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 66

          A brightly-lit open plan office on a high floor of the
          building. The city sprawls magnificently below.
          Partitions divide off the cubicles. Within them sit rows
          of workers, all early 20's, all with headsets clamped to
          their ears. As chaotic as the streets of Jaipur are, this
          place is immaculate, controlled and efficient.
          We hear snatches of what they're saying.

          I'm afraid I'll have to refer

          Through a glass partition, Evelyn can be seen sitting at a
          desk, talking to someone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            40.

          67 INT. SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE. CALL CENTRE - DAY 67

          JAY (late 20's) is talking to Evelyn.

                         JAY
          You're sure I can't offer you
          something? We have English
          Breakfast Tea. Building Tea, as
          you call it.

                         EVELYN
          Builder's tea. It's called
          builder's tea. And no, I'm fine.
          Thank you.

                         JAY
          Tell me then. How can I help
          you?
          Beat.

                         EVELYN
          I don't think you can. I'm
          sorry, I shouldn't have come.
          She stands.

                         JAY

                         WAIT -

                         EVELYN
          I saw your advertisement in the
          local paper, and it specifically
          mentioned the ability to talk to
          older people. But this is not
          what I imagined ...

                         JAY
          You came for a job?

                         EVELYN
          I've wasted your time.

                         JAY
          Mrs Greenslade. Everyone working
          here is a graduate of a good
          university. This is a place for
          ambitious people. Young people.

                         EVELYN
          I see that. Good day.

                         JAY
          Please. One second.
          Evelyn stops.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          It is really builder's tea?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           41.

                         EVELYN
          Yes. We dunk biscuits into it.

                         JAY
          You dunk?

                         EVELYN
          It means lowering a biscuit into
          your tea, letting it soak in
          there, then trying to calculate
          the exact moment just before it
          dissolves to whip it up to the
          mouth, and enjoy the blissful
          union of biscuit and tea
          combined.

                         (BEAT)
          It's more relaxing than it
          sounds.

                         JAY
          Perhaps you can help us after
          all.

          68 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 68

          A few minutes later. From the open-plan office Evelyn can
          be seen talking to Jay.
          One person watching is SUNAINA (20's). She's talking on
          the phone.

                         SUNAINA
          We do appreciate your custom,
          which is very important to us.
          And can I draw your attention to
          our special -
          But the person at the other end has hung up. Sunaina
          starts to dial another number.
          Then the clock hits 11, and a buzzer sounds. Sunaina gets
          up, heads for the door.

          69 EXT. FORECOURT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 69

          Dozens of motorcycles are parked in front of the building.
          People are hanging around chatting and smoking.
          Sonny arrives on his motorcycle, a bag of marigolds
          strapped to the pillion seat.
          Sunaina, who is with some friends, spots him, comes over.
          She smiles as he pulls her to him.

                         SUNAINA
          I get two breaks in eight hours.
          Explain to me why I would want to
          waste one of them with you -

                         

                         

                         

                         
            42.
          He kisses her. She kisses him back.

                         SONNY
          Leave this place. Come and work
          for me.

                         SUNAINA
          You can't afford me.

                         SONNY
          I cannot afford anything.

                         SUNAINA
          Still tempting. I miss you. Am
          I coming round tonight?

                         SONNY
          Let's meet somewhere else. I
          will rent a hotel room.

                         SUNAINA
          Sonny, you own a hotel. It has
          many rooms.

                         SONNY
          Some of them now occupied. With
          actual real guests.

                         SUNAINA
          Paying guests?

                         SONNY
          Why must you nitpick? It is not
          an attractive quality.

                         SUNAINA
          It isn't?
          They kiss again, start to make out a bit. Then

           JAY (O.S.)
          Sunaina!
          They turn to see Jay who has come out of the Call Centre.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          (calling, to Sonny)
          You can let go of my sister now.
          Break's over.

                         SONNY
          Hello Jay.

                         JAY
          Sonny boy.

                         SONNY
          Don't call me that.
          Jay smiles, holds the door open for Sunaina.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           43.

                         JAY
          Let's go.

          70 EXT. GARDEN - EVENING 70

          Jean is sitting in a chair, reading. Graham comes up the
          path.

                         JEAN
          Good evening, Your Honour.

                         GRAHAM
          Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a
          good day. What did you get up
          to?

                         JEAN
          Well, I started in my bedroom,
          where I had a lovely couple of
          hours giving all the cockroaches
          names. Then after a lunch that
          will long have a place in my
          heartburn, I came out here
          and stared blindly at a book
          waiting for someone - anyone to
          rescue me. And how glad I am it
          was you.

                         GRAHAM
          Why would you not go out?
          There's so much to see.
          Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is
          floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let
          alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All
          life is here, I tell you.
          Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into
          the hotel. Then stops.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          I could talk to the chef, if you
          like. Perhaps get you some
          grilled chicken, plain rice.

                         JEAN
          I would appreciate that very
          much.
          Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd
          come back out again.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            44.

          71 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 71

          Muriel is back. She's in her chair, on the terrace outside
          her room.
          A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to
          her.
          Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet
          Muriel's eyes. She puts the tray down and leaves.
          Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night,
          the untouched tray of food by her side.

          72 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD - NIGHT 72

          Evelyn comes into the dining area. Graham is there, at a
          table in the corner.

                         GRAHAM
          Good evening.

                         EVELYN
          Good evening.
          Evelyn sits at her table.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I trust you had a good day?

                         GRAHAM
          I'd rather hear about yours.

                         EVELYN
          I got a job. My first. Ever.
          I'm going to be a sort of
          cultural advisor.

                         GRAHAM
          A role I'm sure you'll perform
          with great distinction.
          He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and
          Jean emerge from their room.

                         EVELYN
          Perhaps if you wouldn't mind
          keeping that news to yourself.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm flattered you shared it with
          me.
          He turns to greet the new arrivals.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Good evening, the Ainslies.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           45.

                         EVELYN
          Have you had a good day?

                         DOUGLAS
          Spectacular.

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          I went to the temple you told me
          about. A place of meditation and
          peace, quite stunning.

                         JEAN
          So spiritual, I bet you hardly
          noticed the smell of elephant
          dung.

                         DOUGLAS
          No elephants, sadly. Still none.

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          I thought I might see you there.
          Where did you get to instead?

                         JEAN
          Yes, where do you get to every
          day?

                         GRAHAM
          Well, I've just finished telling
          Mrs Greenslade all about it.
          Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing.

                         JEAN
          I'm sure she wouldn't mind
          hearing it again.
          She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.

                         GRAHAM
          I talked to the chef for you. He
          said it will be no problem.

                         JEAN
          Did you hear that, Douglas?
          Plain grilled food; manna from
          heaven.

                         DOUGLAS
          I don't have to have it too, do

          I?

                         JEAN

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          I don't know how to thank you.

                         DOUGLAS

                         (TO EVELYN)
          You really should see this
          temple.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           46.

                         EVELYN
          I'd like that very much.

                         DOUGLAS
          But maybe take a clothes peg for
          your nose.

          73 EXT. COURTYARD/UPPER VERANDAH, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 73

          Graham and Evelyn emerge through the arch heading for their
          rooms.
          Graham starts down the stairs.

                         EVELYN
          Goodnight.

                         GRAHAM
          Goodnight to you.
          He seems about to say something else. She waits for a
          moment, then walks on.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Mrs Greenslade?

                         EVELYN
          Evelyn.

                         GRAHAM
          Can I show you something?

          74 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM - NIGHT 74

          Moments later. Evelyn is sitting in front of Graham's
          collage.

                         GRAHAM
          I grew up here. Just a short
          drive away. It was a big house,
          and we had servants, everyone
          did. We knew their wives, their
          children. One boy, Manoj, became
          my friend. We played a lot of
          cricket together, played anything
          we could. And that's how it
          stayed for years. Until one
          night, he became something more.

                         (BEAT)
          We had a few months, we had that.
          There was a weekend in Udaipur,
          we sat by a lake and watched the
          sun go down, and I remember
          thinking . I will never be this
          happy again. And I was right.
          Because quite suddenly it was
          over. We'd fallen asleep, and
          they found us.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           47.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)

                         (BEAT)
          For me it was bad enough. But I
          already knew who I was, and I
          think my family had guessed. For
          Manoj, the disgrace was absolute;
          a double taboo. His father was
          fired, they were sent away, all
          of them. I don't know what I
          could've done, but it should've
          been more than nothing. I put up
          no fight. I let it happen.

                         (BEAT)
          Soon afterwards I went to
          England, to University. I always
          told myself I'd come back. But I
          never did.

                         EVELYN
          Until now.

                         GRAHAM
          And now I think .. what if I am
          the last person on earth he wants
          to see?
          Evelyn says nothing.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          I don't think I can go through
          with it.

                         EVELYN
          Do you want to see him again?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes. Yes. Oh yes.

                         EVELYN
          Then you must.

          75 EXT. TEMPLE/STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 75

          As the bell tolls, the faithful arrive at the temple for
          morning prayers.

          75A EXT. UPPER VERANDAH/SERVANTS COURTYARD - DAY 75A

          Evelyn stands outside her room, listening to the bells,
          sipping a cup of tea, pensive. She looks down into a
          dilapidated part of the building, where the staff are
          housed. Women in bright saris go about their business.

          76 INT/EXT. MURIEL'S ROOM/VERANDAH, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 76

          From her wheelchair, Muriel is re-making her bed. She
          tucks in a perfect hospital corner.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           48.
          She looks up. Anokhi is on the verandah, replacing her
          untouched supper tray with breakfast. Anokhi is about to
          leave, but stops.
          Then she goes to fetch Muriel's jar of pickle from the
          windowsill, and places it on the table.
          Muriel watches, then wheels herself outside, looks at the
          tray.
          From outside, Sonny's voicecan be heard.

          SONNY (O.S.)
          And so now that we are fully
          operational, Mr Maruthi, it is
          clear that with a small injection
          of funds for the Phase Two
          Development ...

          77 EXT. GARDEN/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 77

          Brimming with confidence, Sonny is walking a wealthy
          investor, MR MARUTHI, around the grounds. Some builders
          are dismantling scaffolding.

                         SONNY
          .. the Best Exotic Marigold
          Hotel can rise like a phoenix to
          its previous state of glory. And
          when I say small injection, I
          mean small in the sense of medium-
          sized. Possibly larger.

                         MR MARUTHI
          This hotel was never glorious.

                         SONNY
          Just the phoenix part then.

                         MR MARUTHI
          How many rooms will there be?

                         SONNY
          Many.

                         MR MARUTHI
          How many?

                         SONNY
          A great amount. Plenty of rooms,
          no question.
          They've arrived in the courtyard.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          I am not a details man, Mr
          Maruthi.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           49.

                         MR MARUTHI
          Nor was your father.
          They see Muriel on her verandah.

                         SONNY
          Mr Maruthi, I present to you one
          of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs
          Donnelly, please describe in as
          much detail as you desire your
          experience of the ambience and
          atmosphere of the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel.

                         MURIEL
          Kill me. Kill me now.
          Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks
          quietly.

                         SONNY
          The wheel is spinning. But the
          hamster is dead.
          He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the
          doorway. This is the redoubtable MRS KAPOOR.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Mummyji! What are you doing
          here?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          You called. I came.

                         SONNY
          I couldn't have called. The
          phones don't work.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          That's why I came.

          78 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 78

          Moments later. Sonny closes the door behind him.
          His mother starts going through the contents of his desk.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Who was that man out there?

                         SONNY
          The contents of this desk are
          mine. Don't open the drawers. I
          must insist you don't open the
          drawer.
          Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           50.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Tell me why you have come.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Do I need a reason to visit my
          favourite son?

                         SONNY
          No. He is in his mansion in
          Delhi.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          My second favourite.

                         SONNY
          He went to Kerala to make his
          fortune.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          But make it, he did.

                         SONNY
          As I will make mine. I have a
          dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant
          one: to out-source old age. And
          not just for the British. There
          are many other countries where
          they don't like old people too.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Your brothers own a third of the
          hotel each, they are entitled to
          a third of the profits.

                         SONNY
          Success does not happen
          overnight, Mummyji. This is blue
          sky thinking, and it requires
          long-term strategy and patience.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          How is your girlfriend?

                         SONNY
          I look forward to you meeting
          her.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          And I look forward to you meeting
          the woman you will marry. She is
          from a good family in Delhi.

                         SONNY
          I can marry as I choose, Mummyji.
          I need no permission.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          I presume it is your girlfriend
          who teaches you such nonsense.
          One reason not to marry her.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           51.

                         SONNY
          What if I love her?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          An even better reason. Now send
          Young Wasim to the car for my
          luggage.

                         SONNY
          He cannot carry, he has a dicky
          back ... wait, your luggage? How
          long are you staying?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          As long as it takes.

          79 INT. BATHROOM. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S. MARIGOLD HOTEL - 79


                         DAY
          Jean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the
          courtyard.
          She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to
          the mirror, looks at herself.

          80 EXT. MURIEL'S TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 80

          Near to Muriel, Anokhi is sweeping the floor.

                         MURIEL
          You won't get the dirt out like
          that.
          Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          I worked in service for years,
          looked after a lovely house. I
          kept it spotless. You need a bit
          more pressure on that brush.
          Graham walks past, on his way out.

                         GRAHAM
          She won't speak English. She's
          what used to be called an
          Untouchable. An outcast, born
          below society. To a good Hindu,
          even her shadow is polluted.
          He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.

                         MURIEL
          Where d'you go every day? Is it
          a woman? Nip round there for a
          curry and a bit of afters?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           52.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't think so. I'm gay.
          Although nowadays more in theory
          than practice. Good day.
          He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out.
          Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has
          already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.

                         JEAN
          Good morning.
          Muriel says nothing.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          Lovely day.
          Still nothing from Muriel.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          Lovely.

                         (BEAT)
          Lovely.
          She turns and goes back in.
          Muriel thinks for a while, then turns to Anokhi.

                         MURIEL
          Long old life, isn't it?

          81 EXT. VICEROY CLUB - DAY 81

          A classic colonial building, straight out of the English
          Raj.
          Madge is being shown around by an elderly secretary, MR

          DHARUNA.

                         MR DRARUNA
          The Viceroy Club was opened by
          the great Lord Kitchener himself,
          and many of the fixtures have
          remained unchanged since then.

                         MADGE
          Yes, I see that. Perhaps you
          could tell me a little about the
          clientele? Any maharajahs?
          Wealthy widowed land-owners?

                         MR DHARUNA
          It is not the policy of this club
          to divulge details of our
          members.
          They go past a very handsome older Indian man. Who
          radiates wealth and privilege.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           53.
          MR DHARUNA (cont'd)
          Good morning, Your Excellency.

                         MADGE
          Where do I sign up?

                         MR DHARUNA
          The admission fee is 120,000
          rupees, and thereafter 15,000
          rupees each month.

                         MADGE
          I wonder if I might get a little
          discount. Owing to my status.

                         MR DHARUNA
          Your status, madam?

                         MADGE
          Yes. One was rather hoping to
          fly under the radar, but one is a
          member of the Royal Family.

                         MR DHARUNA
          Which member, madam?

                         MADGE
          I'm Princess Margaret.

                         MR DHARUNA

                         (BOWING SLIGHTLY)
          It is most surely an honour to
          meet you. And may I say how well
          you look. Especially taking into
          account that you died nine years
          ago.

                         (BEAT)
          Your real name please, madam.
          And 120,000 rupees.

          82 INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE - DAY 82

          Graham comes into the chaotic office.
          The bookish official, MR CHIDAMBRAM, is behind the desk.

                         GRAHAM
          Good morning.

                         MR CHIDAMBRAM
          Good morning, Sir. Did I not say
          that we will contact you when
          there is information regarding
          your inquiry?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes, you did say that. You did.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           54.

                         MR CHIDAMBRAM
          While it is most pleasant to see
          you, your presence does not
          actually accelerate our
          investigation.

                         GRAHAM
          I'll try not to come in tomorrow.

                         MR CHIDAMBRAM
          I expect I will see you then.

          83 INT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 83

          None of the operators are on the phone. Instead they are
          sitting in a semi-circle, looking curiously at Evelyn. Who
          is sitting next to Jay, a little daunted by the attention.

                         EVELYN
          .You ring in the morning.
          Let's assume the person answering
          will be a woman. She will have
          had her breakfast. Tea or
          coffee. Semi-skimmed milk,
          always. If she's under 50 she'll
          be contemplating yet another
          diet, over 50 she'll have more or
          less given up, and be eating
          toast. The radio may be playing,
          or more likely daytime TV. A
          chat show, or a programme with a
          moderator speaking to a panel of
          young women whose boyfriends have
          all slept with their mothers.
          The girlfriends' mothers, I mean,
          not their own. Although
          Anyway, then the boyfriends
          usually come out, and everybody
          fights.
          Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.

                         SUNAINA
          I'm not surprised people hang up
          on us.
          Laughter.

                         EVELYN
          That's the point. When the phone
          rings and it's this robot
          nobody wants a machine, but it's
          almost worse when it's a person
          behaving like one. All these
          sales cliches just strung
          together. 'Your call is
          important to us'. Is it? Well
          then sound like it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           55.

                         SUNAINA
          'Your custom is valuable'.

                         EVELYN
          Right. That one. Don't ever say
          that.

                         SUNAINA
          'Service is our middle name'.

                         EVELYN
          Yes, when your middle name is

                         ACTUALLY

                         SUNAINA
          Shantanu.

                         EVELYN
          Which is beautiful. You people
          are young, vibrant, real. I'm
          sure the typical housewife would
          enjoy talking to each and every
          one of you.

                         SUNAINA
          Her morning sounds like fun.
          What are you doing here?
          Beat.

                         EVELYN
          I suppose I'm not typical
          anymore.

                         (TO JAY)
          Is that the sort of thing?

          84 INT. MADGE'S ROOM - EVENING 84

          Madge is at her mirror, doing her make-up with great care.
          She looks beautiful.

          85 EXT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - EVENING 85

          Madge walks up the gravel path towards the magnificent
          building. She's superbly dressed, looks great. She goes
          up to the BARMAN.

                         MADGE
          Excuse me. Would there be any
          wealthy single men in tonight?

                         BARMAN
          There is one.
          Madge puts some money into his breast pocket.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           56.

                         MADGE
          Perhaps you could seat me next to
          him?

                         BARMAN
          This way, madam.
          He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows,
          checking her hair, her breath, etc.
          The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's
          someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm
          draped over the side of the chair.

                         BARMAN (CONT'D)
          His Royal Highness Prince Michael
          of Kent.
          The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left
          staring at Norman.
          There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's
          breast pocket, and removes her money.

                         MADGE
          I'll have that back, thank you
          very much.

          86 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 86

          Graham comes through the courtyard, heads for his room.
          Muriel is on her verandah.

                         GRAHAM
          Good evening.
          Muriel nods at him, and he goes on into his room.
          A moment later, Jean sits down next to Muriel.

                         JEAN
          You know where he goes. I know
          you know. But you won't tell me.
          Muriel says nothing.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          I can get Hobnobs out here, you
          know. I know a way.

                         (BEAT)
          As many as you want. Milk or
          plain.
          Long pause.

           57.

                         JEAN
          Thank you.

          87 EXT. WELL - EVENING 87

          A huge construction, centuries old, with a series of steps
          reaching down deep into the earth, so people can climb down
          to get their water.
          Young couples sit on the steps in the evening heat, boys
          leap into the water.
          Sonny and Sunaina are watching the swimmers.

                         SONNY
          My father used to bring me to
          this well to swim. He said the
          water was better, and so were the
          people we would meet.

                         (BEAT)
          He would have liked you so much.
          Sunaina smiles at this.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          My mother doesn't want us to be
          married.

                         SUNAINA
          She hasn't met me yet.

                         SONNY
          She doesn't need to meet you
          Sunaina absorbs this.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          She knows you are not from Delhi.
          That you have no family money,
          and work in a call centre. You
          are a part of a new India she
          cannot welcome.

                         SUNAINA
          Isn't this where you tell her
          what you want?

                         SONNY
          That conversation will be easier
          when the hotel is a success.

                         SUNANINA
          Do you love me?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           58.

                         SONNY
          I have found a new investor. I
          am most optimistic that he will
          enable us to move forward with
          Phase Two of the Marigold Hotel

                         PROJECT

                         SUNANINA
          Shouldn't you finish Phase One
          first?

                         SONNY
          In business, if you stand still,
          you move backwards. No, I have
          that wrong. If you stand still,
          you are overtaken by people going
          the other way. Wait -

                         SUNAINA
          You didn't answer the question.
          Do you love me?

                         SONNY
          My feelings for you cannot be
          reduced to a single word.

                         SUNAINA
          It's a nice word, Sonny. And
          people like hearing it.

                         SONNY
          Sunaina, please. My mother is
          wrong. It is you who are too good
          for me.

                         SUNANINA
          You say that a lot. You
          shouldn't I'll start to believe
          you.
          They watch the boys in the water.

          88 INT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - NIGHT 88

          Madge and Norman are sitting together. Norman is looking
          across at the bar, where an attractive older ex-pat lady is
          sitting, thus far resisting Norman's attempts to catch her
          eye.

                         NORMAN
          I still think you're cramping my
          style.

                         MADGE
          Please. You have no style to
          cramp.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           58A.

                         NORMAN
          That lady at the bar keeps
          looking at me.

                         MADGE
          As one would something in a
          museum.

                         NORMAN
          Why must you mock? I just want
          to feel young again, to be needed
          as much as I need, if only for
          one night, one wonderful night.
          Tell me you don't know how that
          feels.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           59.
          Silence for a bit.

                         MADGE
          Give me a minute. Then join us.
          She gets up, heads towards the bar. Where she sits a
          couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL.
          She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to
          the barman.

                         MADGE (CONT'D)
          Rejected again. Many years ago,
          that man over there gave me the
          most extraordinary night of my
          life. He may seem coarse and
          uncouth, but that only disguises
          a tenderness and an exquisite
          sensitivity to a woman's needs
          Norman arrives at the bar.

                         NORMAN
          Those drinks not ready yet?
          Madge turns to Carol.

                         MADGE
          They say patience is passion
          tamed.
          Carol smiles.

                         MADGE (CONT'D)
          I'm Madge.

                         CAROL
          Carol.

                         MADGE
          And this . is Norman.

                         CAROL
          How do you do?

                         NORMAN
          Carol? As in Christmas?
          Madge winces.

                         CAROL
          I suppose.

                         NORMAN
          Great.
          Silence.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           60.

                         MADGE
          So what brings you to Jaipur,
          Carol?

                         NORMAN
          Yes, Carol. What brings you to
          Jaipur?

                         CAROL
          I run a small boutique travel
          agency. But I've actually lived
          here all my life. My father
          worked in the Foreign Office.
          Another silence.

                         NORMAN
          You're very fit.

                         CAROL
          I beg your pardon?

                         MADGE
          Oh god.

                         NORMAN
          I mean you look like you keep
          yourself in shape. Physically.

                         CAROL
          Well, I did join a gym last year.
          It cost a fortune, and I didn't
          get any fitter. Apparently you
          have to actually go.
          Madge laughs. Norman doesn't. Then realizes that it was a
          joke, lets out a too-loud bray of laughter.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)
          And so what do you do, Norman?

                         NORMAN
          Me?

                         CAROL
          Yes.

                         NORMAN
          Oh. I'm

                         MADGE
          Norman's in business.

                         CAROL
          Really?

                         NORMAN
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           61.

                         CAROL
          What business?

                         NORMAN

                         (TO MADGE)
          You tell her.

                         MADGE
          Import-Export.

                         NORMAN
          Although these days there's
          rather more Ex- than Im-, if you
          see what I mean.

                         CAROL
          I'm afraid I don't.
          Madge gets up.

                         MADGE
          I have to splash some water on my
          face. Please God I drown in it.
          She heads for the bathroom.
          Norman and Carol share another silence.

                         CAROL
          Well look, it's been lovely
          chatting.

                         NORMAN
          No it hasn't.

                         CAROL
          No. It hasn't. But I really

                         MUST -

                         NORMAN
          Carol?
          She was about to go, stops.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          Can we drop all this pretence?
          And start again? I'm not
          charming. I'm not good at
          repartee. And I'm not a
          plutocrat with the sexual
          capacity of a rutting rhino. My
          name is Norman. And I'm lonely.

                         CAROL
          My name is Carol. So am I.

          89 INT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - NIGHT 89

          Minutes later. Madge comes out of the bathroom.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           62.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Day 22. Like Darwin's finches,
          we are slowly adapting to our
          environment. And when one does
          adapt, my god, the riches that
          are available.
          Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman
          and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together.
          As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns
          smiling back to his new friend.
          Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.

          90 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 90

          Evelyn is at her computer, typing.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          There is no past that we can
          bring back by longing for it

          91 EXT. PATH/GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 91

          Ajit is pushing Muriel down to the gate for her morning
          constitutional.

                         EVELYN
          . only a present that builds
          and creates itself as the past
          withdraws ...

          92 INT. SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE. CALL CENTRE - DAY 92

          Jay is counting out cash into Evelyn's hand; her first
          paycheck.

                         EVELYN
          And India, like so many things in
          life, like life itself I suppose,
          is about what you bring to it.

          93 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAY 93

          Ajit is pushing Muriel through a poor neighborhood. Muriel
          is looking left and right, astounded by the life she sees.

                         MURIEL
          Where's this? Where are we?

                         AJIT
          Janta Colony Kachi Basti.

                         MURIEL
          What happened to my usual route?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           63.

                         AJIT
          Anokhi has invited you to her
          home.

                         MURIEL
          You didn't tell me.

                         AJIT
          You'd have said no.

          94 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 94

          Jean is sitting, reading a book.

                         JEAN
          Will you check in at the bank?
          Douglas emerges from the bathroom.

                         DOUGLAS
          I checked yesterday. And the day
          before. As requested.

                         (BEAT)
          Will you be staying in again?

                         JEAN
          Why do you ask that every
          morning?

                         DOUGLAS
          Because I hope for a different
          answer. Because I think you'll
          be hurt if I don't. And because
          it's not healthy for you to spend
          all day and every day in the
          confines of the hotel.
          He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject.

                         JEAN
          I didn't sleep a wink. The tap
          in there never stops dripping.

          DOUGLAS (O.S.)
          I talked to Young Wasim about it.

                         JEAN
          What did he say?

          DOUGLAS (O.S.)
          No idea. It was in Hindi.
          Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          I thought I might get it fixed
          myself.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           63A.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           64.

                         DOUGLAS
          No time like the present.
          Actually I say that, but I
          enjoyed yesterday, and I'm
          optimistic about tomorrow too.

                         JEAN
          I wish I could say the same.

                         DOUGLAS
          So do I.
          He goes.
          Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and
          lost. Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony.
          Down below she can see Graham leaving.

          95 EXT. LOWER COURTYARD - DAY 95

          Madge is sitting on a chair. Norman arrives.

                         NORMAN
          Your Madgesty.

                         MADGE
          I gather the night went well.

                         NORMAN
          Would you like to hear about it?

                         MADGE
          Not in the least.

                         NORMAN
          Good. Because you're going to.
          Two drinks, some sexually charged

                         BANTER -
          Douglas comes out, carrying a tap. And heads out of the
          archway.

                         DOUGLAS
          Morning. Lovely day.

                         MADGE
          Good morning.
          They watch him leave.

                         NORMAN
          Two drinks, some sexually charged
          banter, and we were heading back
          to her place. Bidding the
          rickshaw farewell, I walked her
          to the door.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           65.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          And there, my young friend, I
          leaned forward, and I kissed her.
          Beat.

                         MADGE
          And?

                         NORMAN
          And what?

                         MADGE
          Is that all? You didn't seal the
          deal?

                         NORMAN
          We have a date next week.

                         MADGE
          What is wrong with you?

                         NORMAN
          I wanted to prolong the
          anticipation. To spend some time
          with the knowledge that soon I'm
          going to eat, drink, and laugh
          with someone, hold her to me,
          kiss her softly. Then go back to
          her place and get my end away.

          96 EXT. MARKET - DAY 96

          The market is buzzing with commerce. Evelyn is at a stall
          selling fabrics, talking to the vendor, AKRAM.

                         EVELYN
          (holding up a pashmina)
          Bow much for this, please Kitna

                         PAISE

                         AKRAM
          One thousand rupees Ek hazaar

                         RUPIA

                         EVELYN
          Thank you.
          She reaches for her wallet. Then Douglas speaks from
          behind her.

                         DOUGLAS
          No no, forgive me. That's not
          how it works.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           65A.
          Evelyn turns, happy to see him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           66.

                         EVELYN
          Good morning.

                         DOUGLAS
          And to you. Sorry to butt in,
          but you don't ask him how much he
          wants, you just tell him how much
          you'll pay.

                         (TO AKRAM)
          She'll give you two hundred.
          Absolutely no more, final offer.

                         AKRAM
          One thousand rupees.

                         DOUGLAS
          Pity.

                         (TO EVELYN)
          Now walk away. Walk away.

                         EVELYN

                         BUT -

                         DOUGLAS
          I know what I'm doing.
          Evelyn complies, and they turn and walk away.

                         EVELYN
          Yes. The thing is, you see, I
          did actually want to buy that.
          To brighten up my room.

                         DOUGLAS
          He'll come after us.

                         EVELYN
          Do you think so?

                         DOUGLAS
          Absolutely. This is how the game
          is played. Just keep on walking.
          They push through the crowds.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          He's playing it cool, but he'll
          come.
          They keep walking.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          He's playing it very cool.
          They keep walking. Then Douglas stops. Evelyn looks at
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           67.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          He's not coming.

                         CUT TO:
          Moments later. They're back at Akram's stall. Evelyn
          counts out the money.

                         EVELYN
          Eight hundred and fifty, nine
          hundred, nine hundred and fifty,
          one thousand.
          She turns to Douglas, smiles.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          You'll get him next time.
          Then she notices something.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Why are you carrying a tap?

          97 INT. MARIGOLD HOTEL, DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - DAY 97

          Jean gives up on the sentence she has already read a
          hundred times, and snaps her book shut. She stands, then
          sits again.
          Then stands.

          98 EXT. SWEEPER COLONY - DAY 98

          Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum.
          The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin
          shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation.
          And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as
          depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the
          smiles on the children's faces even brighter.
          Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's
          horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the
          stares of the slum-dwellers.

          98A EXT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 98A

          A primitive brick and cement hut, one of the few amongst
          dwellings made mostly from sticks and plastic bags.
          A bunch of young kids are fascinated by Muriel's
          wheelchair, pushing it around and taking turns to sit on
          it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            68.

          99 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 99

          Muriel sits on the only chair.
          Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph -
          are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself,
          her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children.
          They all smile at Muriel.
          A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit.

                         MURIEL
          How soon can I leave?

          100 INT/EXT. HARDWARE SHOP - DAY 100

          Douglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the
          counter. Evelyn sits outside.

                         DOUGLAS
          You see what I think, and of
          course I'm no expert, is that the
          valve seat has eroded, so we'll
          need the washer changed and a new
          seat re-ground.
          Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the
          slightest scepticism.
          Jamshed studies the tap.

                         JAMSHED
          The gland nut has come away from
          the spindle.

                         DOUGLAS
          Well of course, it could be that
          too. Can you fix it?

                         JAMSHED
          Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most
          expensively indeed.
          Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts
          to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn.

                         DOUGLAS
          I was in a tuk-tuk the other day,
          didn't seem to be taking the
          usual route back to the hotel.
          It turned out that the driver had
          decided to take me to another
          hotel, that he was sure I would
          prefer. And of course one wants
          to believe that he genuinely had
          my welfare at heart, and that it
          wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           69.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          One wants to trust, in general,
          don't you think? But you never
          really know, do you?
          Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to
          it.

                         EVELYN
          The day I met my husband was the
          day the fair came to town. My
          girlfriend and I went on the
          carousel. Her horse was fine.
          But when the ride began I felt
          mine give a little, like it might
          collapse. Then these strong arms
          were around me, holding the horse
          together. And a voice in my ear
          said "Just trust me". And I did.
          Without question. Until the day
          he died.

                         DOUGLAS
          How wonderful.

                         EVELYN
          The sale of our flat went through
          last week. I had to sell it to
          pay off Hugh's debts.

                         (BEAT)
          I've been forced to get a job out
          here. Which, in fact, I love.
          But even at Sonny's rates, I
          still couldn't make ends meet.
          After what my own husband did to
          our life savings.

                         (BEAT)
          So no. You're right. You never
          know.
          Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts.

                         JAMSHED
          No good. You must be buying
          another.

          101 EXT. PATHWAY/GATE/STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 101

          Jean walks down the path to the gate.
          She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity
          outside. She's unable to move.
          Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately
          assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors,
          etc.
          As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace,
          brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost
          running.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            70.

          102 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 102

          Muriel is still at the tea party.
          Anokhi speaks. Ajit translates.

                         AJIT
          She wants to thank you for your
          kindness.

                         MURIEL
          I haven't been kind.

                         AJIT
          You're the only one that
          acknowledges her.
          Anokhi brings out a plate of food.

                         ANOKHI
          Tarkha dhal. Chapati.

                         MURIEL
          I'm not eating that.

                         AJIT
          You will insult her very deeply
          if you do not.
          Muriel looks up. They're all still watching, waiting
          smiling.
          She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is
          old.
          Muriel reaches out, takes something off the tray. And has
          a bite. It's not too bad.

                         MURIEL
          I'd still rather a Scotch Egg.
          Then she sees something through the open doorway: the
          children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are
          spinning the wheels.
          She's on her feet in a flash.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          Get off! Get off it, you dirty
          thieving bastards!
          Several terrified faces turn.
          One little girl starts to cry.
          Everyone is staring at Muriel.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          I didn't see. They were playing.
          I'm sorry. I'm sorry

                         

                         

                         

                         
            71.

          103 EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 103

           Jean is now in a tuk-tuk, lurching and weaving through the
           traffic, a handkerchief clasped firmly over her mouth,
           panic in her eyes.

          104 INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDORS/OFFICE. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE.104


          JAIPUR - DAY
          The corridors are full of people patiently waiting their
          turn to grapple with a vast bureaucracy.
          Reaching the top of the staircase, Jean takes it all in.
          She walks down another corridor. Then stops.
          Through a doorway, she sees Graham at the desk, talking to
          Mr Chidambram.

                         CUT TO:
          In the office.

                         GRAHAM
          But I've filled out that form.
          I've given it to you. Many
          times.

                         MR CHIDAMBRAM
          There is a process. You are
          making an enquiry. For each
          enquiry a form must be filled in.

                         GRAHAM
          But it's the same enquiry I make
          every day.

                         MR CHIDAMBRAM
          And therefore the same form you
          must fill in.
          Graham glances towards the doorway, catches sight of Jean.
          Their eyes lock, then Jean pulls back out of sight,
          panicked.

          104A INT.CORRIDOR, PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE. JAIPUR - DAY 10414A

           Jean is hurrying down a corridor. Behind her, Graham
           emerges from a doorway, and calls to her

                          GRAHAM
           Mrs Ainslie... .?

                         105 OMITTED 105

                         

                         

                         

                         
           72.

          106 INT. TEA ROOM. JAIPUR - DAY 106

          Later. Jean and Graham are sitting in an elegant tea room.
          Jean is still very shaken.

                         JEAN
          I don't know how you can bear
          this country. What do you see
          that I don't?

                         GRAHAM
          Unutterable beauty. Everywhere.
          In the light, the colours, the
          smiles, the people who see life
          as a privilege not a right, and
          so teach me something every day.
          The waiter brings their tea.

                         JEAN
          Is this milk pasteurized?

                         WAITER
          Yes madam.

                         JEAN
          But that's not true, is it?
          You're just lying to me right now

                         GRAHAM
          It'll be fine.
          The waiter goes.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          It's a pleasant surprise to see
          you out and about.

                         JEAN
          Is it?
          She looks at him.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes. That's progress. Where
          were you going?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           73.

                         JEAN
          To the bank. I . was going to
          the bank. Not that there's any
          reason to think something has
          changed. But our daughter, you
          see, she did promise, and one
          does try to remain optimistic.
          One has to. Otherwise

                         OTHERWISE
          Graham worries she might be about to break down. He
          reaches across the table, puts his hand on hers.
          She leans forward, puts her other hand over his, holds on
          tightly.
          Graham is startled. He tries gently to pull back, but she
          holds on.

                         GRAHAM

                         JEAN -

                         JEAN
          Oh god. Is it possible you feel
          the same?
          She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          The way you talk to me. Your
          compassion, your understanding
          .. the wonderful, tender
          consideration, it had to be more
          than just -

                         GRAHAM
          I'm gay.
          She stares at him. Beat.

                         JEAN
          As in ... happy?
          Graham says nothing. Jean lets go of his hand.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          Yes. I see. Of course I see.
          The ghastly inappropriateness of it all settles on them
          both.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          I appear to have humiliated
          myself. And embarrassed you.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm not embarrassed.
          Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           74.

                         JEAN
          Like I said. This country is
          driving me mad.

                         (BEAT)
          Shall we go?

          107 EXT/INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY107

           Evelyn is outside in the courtyard. We don't see Douglas.

                         EVELYN
          Anything?

          DOUGLAS (O.S.)
          Not yet.
          Evelyn waits a moment.

                         EVELYN
          How about now?

          DOUGLAS (O.S.)
          One second.
          Another pause.
          DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd)
          Oh good lord.

                         EVELYN
          What?

          DOUGLAS (O.S.)
          Listen.
          The sound of a flowing tap.
          DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd)
          And now ...
          The tap stops.
          DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd)
          No drip.
          He appears in the doorway, triumphant.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          No drip!
          He walks towards her, hand in the air.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          Hi-five !
          Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in
          her life.
          After a moment Douglas puts his hand down.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           75.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          I've never done that before. It
          just seemed appropriate.
          Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard.
          Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          Darling!

                         EVELYN
          Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did
          you have a good day?
          Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks
          so happy.

                         DOUGLAS
          Let me tell you about ours. Your
          husband of many a year, who has
          never even known which end of a
          hammer to use, has actually
          managed to -

                         JEAN

                         (SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING)
          We have to get out of here.

                         DOUGLAS
          What did you say?

                         JEAN
          I can't stay in this country a
          moment longer.

                         DOUGLAS
          Why ...?

                         EVELYN
          Do excuse me.
          She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into
          their room.

                         DOUGLAS
          I don't understand

                         JEAN

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          Pick a reason. Pick ten. The
          climate, the squalor, the poverty
          She goes past him into their room.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            76.

          108 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 108


                         JEAN
          . we should never have come.
          This whole trip is a grotesque
          fantasy. It's time to go home.
          Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively.

                         DOUGLAS
          Who's paying for the tickets?

                         JEAN
          (not hearing him)
          Look at us. A group of self-
          deluding old fossils traipsing
          around as if it's our bloody gap
          year. Humiliating ourselves

                         DOUGLAS
          Not us, we can't pay. And I
          don't see you asking our friends

                         BACK HOME

                         JEAN

                         (OVERLAPPING)
          .. We should just face up to the
          truth. That we're all old, we're
          all past it. That's the real
          truth, the raw, unvarnished fact
          of the matter. All we're good
          for now is the beige bloody
          bungalow with the sodding panic
          button in the sodding corner ...
          She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying
          quietly.
          Nobody speaks for a while.

                         DOUGLAS

                         (GENTLY)
          We just have to make the best of
          it, darling. I really think
          that's the best thing to do.

                         JEAN
          Yes, well. When I want your
          opinion, I'll give it to you.

          109 INT. MEEHAR CLINIC - MORNING 109

          An impossibly small roadside clinic.
          Norman is sitting there, the only man in three rows of
          brightly dressed women.
          DR RAMA comes out of the consulting area.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           77.

                         DR RAMA
          Mr John Smith.
          No response. The doctor looks at Norman, who has forgotten
          his own alias.
          DR RAMA (cont'd)
          Mr John Smith?
          Norman jumps up.

                         NORMAN
          That's right! Me!

          110 EXT/INT. MARKET/OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 110

          Sonny is at the flower market, sitting on his motor bike,
          waiting for the flower vendor to tie up his bundle of
          marigolds. He's on his phone.

                         SONNY
          Come on. Pick up pick up pick
          up.
          The phone is answered at the other end.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Sunaina, I must see you. I must.
          If I cannot hold your body
          against mine, I swear I will go
          mad.
          We cut to the call centre. It's not Sunaina on the phone,
          but Jay, who is standing next to her.

                         SONNY'S VOICE

                         (ON PHONE)
          I yearn for you, I burn for you,

                         I -

                         JAY
          I think it's my sister you're
          burning for there, Sonny boy.

                         SONNY
          Thank you, Jay. Thank you.
          Jay hands the phone to Sunaina.

                         SUNAINA
          Hey.

                         SONNY
          Private line, Sunaina. Do those
          words mean nothing to you?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           78.

                         SUNAINA
          He took the phone. What could I
          do?

                         SONNY
          I miss you. I miss you every
          moment. Come and see me.
          Tonight.

                         SUNAINA
          I cannot tonight. It is my
          parents 25th wedding anniversary.
          Tell your mother that.

                         SONNY
          Come after. Come late

                         SUNANINA
          You'll be asleep.

                         SONNY
          I'll be waiting.

                         SUNANINA
          You'll be asleep. But i can wake
          you in that special way...

                         SONNY
          You will sneak in?

                         SUNAINA
          I'm not ashamed.

                         SONNY
          Neither am I. Absolutely not.
          There is no shame. You do not
          have to sneak.

                         (BEAT)
          All the same, if you did want to
          be very quiet, and not let anyone
          see you, it couldn't hurt.

          111 INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY 111

          Norman is talking to DR RAMA.

                         NORMAN
          I'm worried there's no lead in my
          pencil.

                         DR RAMA
          OK. I don't know what that
          means.

                         NORMAN
          No snap in my celery.

                         DR RAMA
          I'm still not quite with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           78A.

                         NORMAN
          I plan to party hearty tonight,
          but I can't guarantee that my
          love gun will fire.

                         DR RAMA
          Mr Smith -

                         NORMAN
          Will the lance dance, and the
          trouser lion roar?

                         DR RAMA
          What is your problem?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           79.

                         NORMAN
          I don't know if I can still have
          sex.

                         DR RAMA
          Ah.

                         NORMAN
          I'm not a young man anymore,
          doctor. And I'm a little bit
          scared. Truth be told, I'm a lot
          scared.

                         DR RAMA
          How long since you've been with a
          woman?

                         NORMAN
          What's today?

                         DR RAMA
          Monday.

                         NORMAN
          Six years.

                         DR RAMA
          I've got some pills that'll help.

          112 EXT. SERVANTS COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 112

          The back of the hotel, where Sonny envisages his Phase Two
          development. Very dilapidated.
          Anokhi is cleaning pots. Young Wasim sits in the corner.
          Ajit has just wheeled Muriel into the courtyard.

                         MURIEL

                         (TO ANOKHI)
          I wanted to tell you something...
          Anokhi looks up.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)

                         (TO AJIT)
          Tell her. Tell her I was glad to
          come, glad she invited me.
          Ajit translates.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          Glad to meet her family. Her
          grandmother. Her kids.
          Ajit translates. Anokhi speaks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           80.

                         AJIT
          She asks if you have children?

                         MURIEL
          I looked after somebody else's.
          Ajit translates.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          This one family, years I was with
          them. I ran the house, looked
          after the money, did it all,
          cared for them like they were my
          own.
          Ajit starts to translate. But Muriel doesn't wait.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          That's the mistake, see. You
          don't want to get like that, to
          start feeling part of something.
          One day they decided I needed
          some help. I was grateful, I
          tried to teach her. Not just the
          books, but how to crisp up the
          bacon like the gentleman
          preferred it, the way the little
          one liked to have her hair
          brushed. The things you only
          know if you care. But then they
          said I was no longer useful to
          them. Thanked me for my service.
          As if that's all it was.

                         (BEAT)
          I got a flat in the end. I'm the
          only one in the building not a
          foreigner. More Indians there
          than here! But before I came to
          this place, my biggest problem
          was what to do with all the time
          I had. Because that flat's so
          small, I can have the whole place
          spotless in half an hour. And
          then what am I supposed to do for
          the rest of the day?
          There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks.

                         AJIT
          Did you want me translate that as
          well?
          Muriel smiles. It's the first time we've seen this.
          Muriel stops, thrusts something into Ajit's hand.

                         MURIEL
          Give her these.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           81.
          Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of
          Chocolate Hobnobs.
          This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries
          to hide her desire to leave. Ajit turns her chair and
          pushes her away.
          Over this, the sound of singing

          113 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 113

          Norman's on his rooftop, under the primitive spout of water
          that passes as his shower. Hanging from a nail in the wall,
          the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre Indian cover
          version of the Chic song "Le Freak".
          Norman is naked, and singing along lustily.

                         NORMAN
          Aaaaaah, freak out! Le freak,
          c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out!
          Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco
          move.

          114 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 114

          Sonny is in his office, going through the accounts.
          There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no
          attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then
          realises what it is.
          He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts
          frantically looking for the telephone.

          115 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 115

          Graham and Evelyn are having drinks.

                         EVELYN
          I've been getting out and about
          as much as I can, but I feel I've
          hardly scratched the surface. And
          of course I'd love to see
          Udaipur. The lake you talked
          about.

                         GRAHAM
          I'd love to take you. Perhaps -
          He breaks off. Douglas and Jean have come in. Jean looks
          rather desperate.

          EVELYN AND DOUGLAS

                         (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
          Good evening.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           81A.
          An awkward moment. Graham stands.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           82.

                         GRAHAM
          Good evening, Mrs Ainslie.
          Please allow me.
          He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of
          passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity.

                         JEAN
          You're very kind. But I rather
          think I'll turn in early.
          Goodnight everyone.
          She goes into her room.

          116 EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 116

          Muriel is sitting outside her room, doing the crossword.
          Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead.
          Norman is standing in front of her, on his way out. He
          looks transformed. And rather handsome.

                         MADGE
          Is this it?

                         NORMAN
          This is it.

                         MADGE
          You're not worried about the
          danger of having sex at your age?
          Norman shrugs.

                         NORMAN
          If she dies, she dies.
          He leaves. Sonny sprints into the courtyard.

                         SONNY
          Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs
          Hardcastle! The wheel is turning
          most assuredly in our favour!
          He shoots up the stairs.

          117 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING. 117

          Douglas, Graham and Evelyn are looking at the menu.
          Sonny bursts in.

                         SONNY
          Mr Dashwood! Everybody! Great
          news!

                         

                         

                         

                         
           83.

                         GRAHAM
          What is it, Sonny?

                         SONNY
          They are working, they are
          working!

                         GRAHAM
          That is great news. What are
          working?

                         SONNY
          The telephones of the Marigold
          Hotel.

                         GRAHAM
          Well, congratulations.

                         SONNY
          Thank you. I must tell
          everybody. I must tell my
          mother!
          He runs off. Comes back.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Oh wait. You have a phone call.

          118 EXT. STREET, POOR NEIGHBOURHOOD. JAIPUR - EVENING 118

          Graham, Evelyn, and Douglas are walking quickly up a quiet
          street.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a false alarm. There's no
          way they could find anything in
          that office. They probably just
          picked an address at random, just
          to keep me off their backs. I'm
          sure that's what happened. It's
          going to be nothing. Don't you
          think it's going to be nothing?

                         EVELYN
          I think you should knock on the
          door and see.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes. Yes I should.

                         (BEAT)
          Yes.

          119 EXT. HOUSE - EVENING 119

          Some men sit under a tree, playing cards.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           84.
          Across the street, Graham approaches a house. At a polite
          distance, Evelyn and Douglas wait. Graham knocks at the
          open door.
          A woman, GAURIKA, appears. She stares at Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm sorry to disturb you so late.
          My name is Graham Dashwood. A
          long time ago I -

                         GAURIKA
          I know who you are.
          Beat.

                         GRAHAM
          I am afraid I don't know you.

                         GAURIKA
          I am Gaurika. The wife of Manoj.

                         GRAHAM
          (after a fraction of a

                         BEAT)
          I'm very pleased to meet you.
          And if you could, if you would
          tell him that I called around,
          I'd appreciate that very much,

                         AND -
          He breaks off. She's walked past him, looking to the other
          side of the road.
          He turns to look at the men playing cards. Gaurika calls in
          Hindi.
          A beautiful-looking man looks up. MANOJ.
          He looks across at the house. Stands up slowly as Graham
          walks across the street towards him.
          Graham reaches him. The two men just stand there for a
          moment. Then they hug very tightly.
          From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches.
          Evelyn looks at her, fascinated.
          Across the street, Manoj and Graham are still holding each
          other, unable to let go.

          120 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 120

          Douglas and Evelyn are walking.

                         DOUGLAS
          (a tiny bit sloshed)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
            85.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          First time going in to London
          with my dad, on his commute...
          He'd always been so extraordinary
          to me, so unique. But there he
          was standing on the station
          platform, utterly
          indistinguishable from all the
          other men in suits. And then of
          course a few years later I was
          one of them... Hated my job.
          Hated it.

                         (BEAT)
          Sorry, talking too much. Blame a
          good dinner out.

                         EVELYN
          What was she thinking?

                         DOUGLAS
          I beg your pardon?

                         EVELYN
          His wife. Manoj's wife. She
          knew who Graham was. Had he told
          her?

                         (BEAT)
          D'you think we'll find out
          tomorrow?

                         DOUGLAS
          Not me, I'm heading up to the
          Badi Mahal Palace. Very excited,
          been reading all about it.

                         EVELYN
          Tell me.

                         DOUGLAS
          I would, if I could remember a
          word.
          Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls
          her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them.
          Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on
          towards the Marigold.
          Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding
          each other. Something passes between them that embarrasses
          them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily.
          They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite
          timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune.

                         WAITER
          Come, please. Nice meal,
          please...

                         

                         

                         

                         
           86.

                         DOUGLAS

                         (NAMASTE GESTURE)
          We've eaten, thank you...
          They continue on their way. Slightly further apart than
          before.

          121 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 121

          It's the middle of the night, and everything's quiet Or
          as quiet as it can be in the middle of the usual night-time
          Indian cacophony.
          Sunaina parks her bike outside the hotel, goes on in.

          122 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 122

          Sonny is sleeping peacefully.

          123 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 123

           Sunaina moves across the courtyard.
           Not sneaking, exactly. But making no sound.

          124 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 124

           Sonny sleeps on.

          125 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 125

           Sunaina is definitely sneaking now. She aims down the
          passage towards Sonny's room.

          126 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 126

           Sonny stirs, but doesn't wake up.

          127 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 127

           Sunaina comith esno te bedroom.
           She takes off her clothes. And climbs, naked, into bed
           beside the sleeping figure.

          128 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 128

          A loud scream.
          In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up.
          And remembers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            87.

          129 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 129

          It's Sunaina that's screamed. Because she's in bed with
          Madge.
          Who couldn't be happier.

                         MADGE
          A midnight booty call. How
          utterly marvellous.

          130 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 130

          Sonny hares out of his temporary bedroom, and races down
          the corridor, towards Madge's room.

          131 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 131

          Sunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room,
          grabbing one of Madge's generous scarves to cover her
          nakedness.

                         SUNAINA
          I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I
          don't know what your name is, but
          I'm incredibly sorry.

                         MADGE
          Don't be. Most action I've had
          in weeks.

                         SUNAINA
          If you could just please not

                         MENTION -
          Sonny bursts in.

                         SONNY
          Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle! I
          can explain each and every thing!
          Hesees Sunaina.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Oh my god you are naked.
          He turns to Madge.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Mrs Hardcastle, I must apologise
          with deep and profound sincerity -

                         SUNAINA
          How could you not tell me you
          weren't in your room!

                         

                         

                         

                         
           88.

                         SONNY
          Yes, Sunaina, to you too I must
          apologise with equally deep and
          profound sincerity. Now go. Get
          out. Quickly.

                         SUNAINA
          I'm going. Just let me get
          dressed, and -

                         SONNY
          No no, quicker than that. You
          must leave, before -
          MrsKapoor flings open the door.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          What is going on here? Who
          screamed?
          She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina.
          MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
          No no no no no. No! This is a
          respectable hotel, not a brothel.

                         (TO SUNAINA)
          You, get out.

                         (TO MADGE)
          And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected
          better of you. Actually, this is
          exactly what I expected of you,
          but nevertheless -

                         SUNAINA
          Mrs Kapoor, I'm Sunaina.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Since I will not be paying for
          your services, your name is of no
          interest to me.

                         (BEAT)
          How do you know mine?
          Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know
          her name. Sonny steps forward reluctantly.

                         SONNY
          Because this . is my Sunaina.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          The girl who my son described as
          not too modern.

                         MADGE
          This is getting interesting.

                         MRS KAPOOR

                         (TO SUNAINA)
          Tell me, please.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           89.
          MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
          Is there anyone in this building
          you haven't slept with?

                         SONNY
          Mummyji, do not get the wrong
          idea. Sunaina was not here to be
          with Mrs Hardcastle. She was
          here to have sex with me!
          Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina. Who is speechless.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          This is the sort of woman you
          are. OK. Each to her own. But
          do not ever try and tell me that
          you are suitable wife for my son.

                         (BEAT)
          Find your clothes and go. I
          don't expect to see you again.

          132 EXT. GARDEN/PATHWAY. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 132

          Sunaina is leaving the hotel, angry and humiliated. Evelyn
          and Douglas are coming up the path.

                         EVELYN
          Sunaina?
          And now Sunaina is even more humiliated.

          132A EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 132A

          Sunaina roars away on her scooter.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          133 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 133

          The same street. The sun is just coming up, and traders are
          setting up their stalls, spreading their wares on rugs on
          the ground.
          One trader is unloading some fruit. A few guava roll off
          the edge of his wagon.
          Someone picks them up for him. It's Graham, who smiles as
          he puts them back. The trader gives him a fresh one.
          Graham takes it, and walks on, munching the delicious
          fruit. A contented man.

          134 EXT. GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 134

          Norman is sitting on a stone bench under a spreading tree.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           90.

          GRAHAM (O.S.)
          How did it go?
          Norman turns, to see Graham standing above him.

                         NORMAN
          I have seen the top of the
          mountain. And it is good.
          Graham nods, sits down next to him. They gaze out at the
          waking city.

                         GRAHAM
          I saw someone yesterday, a man I
          hadn't seen for many years. A
          man I've loved all my life.
          Norman is a bit startled by this.

                         NORMAN
          A man... .?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         NORMAN
          Carry on.

                         GRAHAM
          (smiling, unperturbed)
          I didn't know how he'd been in
          the meantime, didn't want to
          guess. I brought disgrace upon
          him and his family, and imagined
          he might hate me for it.

                         (BEAT)
          But we talked all night. He's
          been happy. He's led a peaceful
          life, married to a woman who
          understood him and loved him
          nonetheless. But he's never
          forgotten me. That's what he
          said.

                         (BEAT)
          I asked his forgiveness anyway.
          He said he had nothing to forgive
          me for. That instead I should
          forgive myself.

                         (BEAT)
          All that time. All that time I
          believed I'd sentenced him to a
          life of shame. When I was the
          one in prison.

                         (BEAT)
          But not any more.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           91.
          Silence for a while.

                         NORMAN
          Top of the mountain.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.
          Norman smiles, then stands and goes on inside.
          Graham settles back into his chair, looks out at the world.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Not any more.

          135 EXT. COURTYARD/VERANDAH, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 135

          Norman comes into the courtyard. Madge, sipping from a cup
          of chai, calls down from her verandah.

                         MADGE
          How was the night?

                         NORMAN
          Rather special.
          He leaves. Madge just stares after him.

          136 EXT. STAIRCASE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 136

          Norman on the stairs to his room.
          He stops, catches his breath.

          137 EXT. GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 137

          Graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird. A snow
          crane; white and magnificent. It's on the grass in front
          of him.
          Then it opens its huge wings, takes off. And flies up into
          the bright blue sky. It's an extraordinary sight.
          As Graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip, it appears
          suddenly to slow and stall, until it seems to hang in the
          air, almost motionless.

          138 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 138

          Norman crosses the rooftop to his bedroom. He comes
          inside, sits on the bed.

          139 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 139

          Graham is still sitting in the garden.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           92.

          EVELYN (O.S.)
          You're back.
          He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden.
          She goes over to him.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          It's been rather an extraordinary
          night all round. First tell me
          your news, and then -
          She breaks off.
          Graham is dead.

          139A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 139A


          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Day 45. Of course it was
          inevitable. Put enough old
          people in the same place, it
          won't be too long before one of
          them goes...
          Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and sobered

          140 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 140

          A train is crossing the endless fields.

          141 INT. TRAIN - DAY 141

          Evelyn stares out of the window. Madge, Norman, Douglas
          and Jean are behind her. Opposite sits Manoj. Evelyn
          turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who
          sits beside him.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          We all know it'll happen, but few
          of us know when. Graham died of
          a heart attack, evidently not his
          first. So he had a better idea
          than most what was coming, he
          just neglected to tell us. His
          prerogative.

          142 EXT. LAKE - DAWN 142

          Three white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway,
          which barely rises above the surface of the lake. They
          seem to be floating. Clouds of dust billow behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           93.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          There was talk of sending the
          body home, but Manoj felt he
          should have a Hindu burial. At
          the place they had visited
          together. Not a holy place.
          Although for them perhaps it was.

          143 EXT. FUNERAL PYRE, RUINS - DAY 143

          A ruined garden, surrounded by the waters of the lake,
          crumbling pillared porticoes and arches. What must once
          have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and
          overgrown.
          Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the
          flames. Manoj, dressed in white, stands with Gaurika. He
          recites a Hindi prayer.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          A body takes a long time to be
          consumed. Many hours for the
          mourners to remember their dead.
          The fire must be lit at dawn, and
          by sunset, there must be nothing
          left but ash.

          144 EXT. LAKESIDE - SUNSET 144

          Stripped to the waist, Manoj walks into the water, holding
          a bowl.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Where do our souls go? is that
          all of us that is left behind?
          Perhaps the most we can ask is
          that when we do shuffle off, we
          do so knowing that we were loved
          Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and
          dance, caught in the gentle currents.

          145 EXT. SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 145

          Muriel and Anokhi are in the servants' garden. Young Wasim
          sits silently in the corner.

                         MURIEL
          So there's a process, they call
          it pickling. I have no idea what
          it is, or how they do it, but
          whoever invented it was a smart
          man. But the real genius was the
          one who introduced an onion into
          the system. That I could never
          have thought of.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           94.
          Ajit looks at her, ready to translate.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          No, forget it.
          Muriel is looking out at the yard. She sees Mrs Kapoor,
          talking to some surveyors. They're mapping out the
          building.
          Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Mrs Donnelly, what are you doing
          here? You should not be here,
          talking with this one.

                         MURIEL
          I'm helping her clean. If these
          pots get any dirtier, you'll have
          to serve the food with
          penicillin.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          We have other rooms. Go to one
          of them instead. While this is
          still a hotel.
          She turns back to the surveyors.

                         MURIEL

                         (TO AJIT)
          What's her problem? What's
          happening here?
          Ajit can't answer. But he knows a man who can.
          He points to Young Wasim.

                         AJIT
          He can tell you.

          146 EXT. ROOFTOP BAR, BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL. UDAIPUR - 146


                         EVENING
          A stunning view over the city. Madge is having a drink
          with Norman. Douglas is sitting on the wall, but keeps
          looking down towards the stairs.

                         MADGE
          When someone dies, you think
          about your own life. And in my
          case, there is less of it in
          front of me than behind. And I
          don't want to grow older. I
          don't want to be condescended to,
          ignored and marginalised by
          society. To become peripheral to
          the action.

           95.
          MADGE (coat' d)
          I don't want to be the first
          person let off the plane in a
          hostage crisis.
          They laugh together. And don't even see Douglas go.

          147 EXT. LANDING. BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL - EVENING 147

          The landing is large, and open to the sky. Evelyn has just
          come up the stairs to go to her room. She's leaning against
          the stone baluster.

                         DOUGLAS
          I wondered where you'd been.
          Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          We're all up top, having a drink.

                         EVELYN
          I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's
          wife. I wanted to ask her what
          she knew. And the answer was
          that she knew everything, that
          he'd loved another man, and
          always would. He told her when
          the marriage was arranged.

                         (BEAT)
          They had no secrets from each
          other, none.
          Suddenly she's crying. Unable to stop.
          Douglas puts his arms around her, and holds her to him.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          And that's right, don't you see?
          That must be right. Because what
          is the point of a marriage in
          which nothing is shared?
          Her words hang in the air. They stand there for a moment.
          Jean has come out of her room, and stands there, watching
          them.

                         JEAN
          Mrs Greenslade, might I have my
          husband back now?
          They spring apart.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          Douglas?
          She walks off back into the room. Douglas turns to Evelyn.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           96.

                         DOUGLAS

                         FORGIVE ME

                         EVELYN
          Yes, of course.

                         DOUGLAS
          Forgive me.
          Evelyn goes quickly to her room, leaving him standing
          there.

          148 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - EVENING 148

          Douglas closes the door.

                         DOUGLAS
          She was upset.

                         JEAN
          Spare me your explanations.
          D'you think I'm jealous?

                         DOUGLAS
          I don't see why else you would
          have embarrassed me. And Evelyn.

                         JEAN
          You were already doing a
          perfectly good job of
          embarrassing yourself. Can you
          imagine how ghastly it's been for
          everyone to watch you mooning
          around after that simpering doe-
          eyed ex-housewife, taking
          advantage of her loneliness and -

                         DOUGLAS
          God, can you hear yourself? Can
          you? Do you have any idea what a
          terrible person you've become?
          Jean is stunned into silence.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          All you give out is this endless
          negativity, a refusal to see any
          kind of light and joy even when
          it's right in your face, and a
          desperate need to squash any sign
          of happiness in me or anyone else
          .. it's a wonder I don't fling
          myself at the first kind word or
          gesture that comes my way. But I
          don't. Out of some dried-out
          notion of loyalty and respect,
          neither of which I ever bloody
          get in return.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           97.
          There's a long silence.

                         JEAN
          I checked my emails. This came.
          She hands him a piece of paper.

          149 EXT. ROOFTOP BAR. BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL - EVENING 149

          Evelyn comes onto the terrace, and heads for Madge and
          Norman. She picks up Madge's glass.

                         MADGE
          Are you alright?

                         EVELYN
          I just need some water.
          She drains the glass.

                         MADGE
          That was a gin and tonic.

                         EVELYN
          Yes. I know that now.

                         MADGE
          What's happened?

                         NORMAN
          Good evening, the Ainslies.
          Douglas and Jean are approaching them.

                         MADGE
          How are you both?

                         JEAN
          We're particularly well.
          Douglas, tell them our news.
          She looks to him, waits. He says nothing.
          So she turns, and smiles.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          We're going home.

          150 EXT. EVELYN'S VERANDAH/KITCHEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 150

          Sonny is with his investor, Mr Maruthi. They emerge from
          the upper courtyard onto the terrace overlooking the back
          of the hotel.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           98.

                         SONNY
          And so I would ask you to loosen
          the strings on your purse, Mr
          Maruthi, and to do it most
          rapidly. So that Phase Two
          Development of the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel can begin with
          immediate effect.
          Mr Maruthi looks down, sees Muriel. She's with Anokhi,
          Ajit, and Young Wasim.
          He calls down to her.

                         MR MARUTHI
          Mrs Donnelly, I believe.
          Sonny spots the danger, tries to lead Mr Maruthi away.

                         SONNY
          And now if you would please be
          following me to the ground floor

                         ROOMS
          Mr Maruthi ignores him, calls down again.

                         MR MARUTHI
          How are things at the hotel?

                         SONNY
          Mr Maruthi -

                         MURIEL

                         (CALLING BACK)
          Better. They're going better.
          Sonny takes a moment to recover.

                         SONNY
          You see? Profound satisfaction.
          Such is the inevitable result of
          a prolonged stay at the Marigold
          Hotel.
          And now Mr Maruthi has spotted something else. The
          surveyors, who are still taking their measurements.

                         MR MARUTHI
          What are those men doing?

                         SONNY
          (Glancing back for a moment)
          Working for me, Mr Maruthi. To
          create a home for the elderly so
          wonderful that they will simply
          refuse to die! Stare death in
          the face and say-

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           98A.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          (follows Mr Maruthi's

                         GAZE)
          What are those men doing?

                         

                         

                         

                         
            99.

          151 EXT. KITCHEN/SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 151

          Moments later. Through the window, Muriel watches Sonny
          confronting his mother.

                         SONNY
          Mummyji, what is going on here?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          I have spoken to your brothers.
          They want to sell the hotel.
          These men are here to value the
          building.

                         SONNY
          They are valuing the land. My
          brothers do not care about the
          building. They will knock it
          down.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          They could just wait a month for
          it to fall down of its own
          accord.

                         SONNY
          You joke, Mummyji, but inside I
          know you are not laughing. You
          do not want to see this dream
          destroyed. Send these people
          away.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          No, my son. It is too late.

          152 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 152

          Mrs Kapoor is at the desk, going through the accounts.
          Sonny stands opposite her.

                         SONNY
          Mummyji, please -

                         MRS KAPOOR
          These figures do not support your
          argument.

                         SONNY
          There is still time to turn
          things around. With a small
          injection of funds, we can -

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Who is trusting you with that
          money? Eh? You, who cannot run
          a chai stand. Just like your
          father.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           100.
          Beat. Then Sonny speaks quietly.

                         SONNY
          Do I remind you of him so much?
          Is that why you must be cruel to
          me?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          You think I am cruel?

                         SONNY
          You loved my father. And he
          loved this hotel.

                         MRS KAPOOR

                         (FIERCELY)
          Two mistakes. There will not be
          a third.

                         (BEAT)
          Say goodbye to all this, Sonny.
          And come with me to Delhi. Your
          life will become easier.

                         SONNY
          Not easier, Mummyji. Smaller.
          He leaves.
          Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some
          paperwork, discomfited.
          She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Mrs Donnelly. Can I help you?

                         MURIEL
          Depends. Do you know how to use
          a computer?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          I assume you are joking.

                         MURIEL
          Mrs Ainslie said she had an
          address where I could get some
          things I need. Some biscuits.
          She said I could get them on the
          line.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          I wish you luck.
          Mrs Kapoor smiles, and leaves.
          Muriel watches her go, then turns to the computer.
          Her fingers fly across the keyboard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            101.

          153 INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 153

          The train rattles its way through the night. Jean is
          chatting away, in a better mood than we've seen her for
          some time. Evelyn listens in silence.

                         JEAN
          The whole thing is actually
          tremendously exciting. Not just
          getting on a plane, but getting
          on a plane and turning left.

                         NORMAN
          Turning left?

                         JEAN
          First class. And home in time
          for our 40th wedding anniversary.
          We haven't yet decided how to
          mark the occasion.

                         MADGE
          Perhaps a minute's silence?

          154 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 154

           Ajit keeps watch, while Muriel is at the printer. Waiting
           as it disgorges pages.

                         155 OMITTED 155

          155A EXT. STREET. JAIPUR STATION - DAY 155A

          The tuk-tuks are lined up.

                         NORMAN
          (hailing a tuk-tuk)
          Two should fit us all, I think.

                         EVELYN
          I'm actually going to walk.
          Apparently they're getting ready
          for a festival.

                         DOUGLAS
          Perhaps you'd like one of us to
          accompany you.

                         MADGE
          I'm happy to walk with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           102.

                         EVELYN
          I'll be fine.
          Evelyn speaks to both Douglas and Jean.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I'm delighted for your daughter's
          success. I wish you all every
          happiness.

                         JEAN
          Thank you.
          Evelyn turns, and walks away.

          156 INT. TUK-TUX - DAY 156

          Douglas and Jean are in the tuk-tuk with Madge and Norman.
          There is a sombre atmosphere.
          A motor-bike hurtles past them, going the other way.

                         DOUGLAS
          Was that Sonny?

          157 INT. CHRISTOPHER'S HOUSE, LONDON - DAY 157

           A phone is ringing. Christopher is still in bed, his wife
           Polly asleep next to him.
          He answers.

                         CHRISTOPHER

                         YES
          (can't believe his ears)
          Ma?

          158 EXT. PHONE BOOTH. TICKET OFFICE. JAIPUR STATION - DAY 158

          Evelyn stands under the awning of the ticket office.

                         EVELYN
          I just wanted to hear your voice.

                         (BEAT)
          No, I'm sorry, I didn't think
          about the time . How are you?
          And Polly? The boys . how are
          the boys?
          She listens to him. She's holding back tears.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          Oh good, I'm glad you've been
          reading it. Yes. Yes, I've made
          some very good friends.

                         (BEAT)
          No, I'm fine, of course I am.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           103.
          As much as she had wanted to speak to him, she now wants
          the conversation to be over.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          I think my money is running out,
          I'd better go. Goodbye for now,
          darling. I'll call again later.
          She hangs up. And stays there with her hand on the phone.
          Out on the street, Sonny is pulling up. She looks over to
          him.

                         SONNY
          Mrs Greenslade. Where are the
          others?

                         EVELYN
          They're on their way to the
          hotel.
          Sonny looks around, at a loss.

                         EVELYN (CONT'D)
          What's the matter?

                         SONNY
          I wanted to warn you before you
          see for yourself of the most
          momentous changes that are
          occurring, absolutely all of them
          without question for the very
          positive.

                         EVELYN
          What are you talking about?

                         SONNY
          I am delighted to announce the
          closing of the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel, and the joyful
          return of all of its inhabitants
          to their home country.

                         EVELYN
          What?

          159 EXT. GARDEN PATH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 159

          Norman and Madge have arrived back at the hotel.
          Mrs Kapoor is breaking the news to them.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Please relax in the knowledge
          that your journey home is being
          arranged, and paid for by the
          hotel.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           104.

                         MADGE
          Our journey here was arranged and
          paid for by the hotel, and look
          how that went. I'd rather walk
          back to England.

                         NORMAN
          I'd rather not go back at all.
          A voice comes behind them. Carol has come out of the
          courtyard.

                         CAROL
          Why would you have to?

          160 EXT. JAIPUR STATION - DAY 160

          Sonny and Evelyn are still talking.

                         SONNY
          And for myself the news is even
          better. I shall be moving to
          Delhi to live with my mother, and
          furthermore I shall be wed to a
          most suitable person of her
          choice, whom I look forward very
          much to meeting before I spend
          the rest of my life with her.

                         EVELYN
          But what about your girlfriend?

                         SONNY
          She is no longer my girlfriend.

                         EVELYN
          This is a disaster.

                         SONNY
          Then we must treat it just the
          same as we would treat a triumph,
          is that not what your Mr Kipling
          tells us? Although of course,
          here we have a problem. Because
          I, Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have
          never had a triumph, so of course
          I do not know how to treat one.
          No, all I have had is an constant
          series of disasters interspersed
          with the occasional catastrophe,
          an unending stream of total -

                         EVELYN
          Sonny, do you love her? Sunaina?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           105.

                         SONNY
          Most deeply.

                         EVELYN
          Have you told her you love her?

                         SONNY
          It is because I love her that I
          must not tell her. She can do so
          much better than me.

                         EVELYN
          And you have told her that?

                         SONNY
          Many times.

                         EVELYN
          Good. Women love it when you say
          that kind of thing. It's a
          powerful aphrodisiac.

                         SONNY
          Really?

                         EVELYN
          No, of course not. Go and find
          her right now, before you lose
          her forever. Her future is hers
          to choose, and so is yours. You
          can have anything you want,
          Sonny. You just need to stop
          waiting for someone to tell you
          you deserve it. Or you can just
          keep failing yourself, and
          hurting the ones you love -

                         SONNY
          Mrs Greenslade, stop drilling!
          You have struck oil!
          He goes to his bike, climbs on, and rockets off.

          161 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 161

          Madge is sitting, pensive. Carol comes in.

                         MADGE
          Where's Norman?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           106.

                         CAROL
          Packing.

                         MADGE
          But we don't have to leave yet.

                         CAROL
          I asked him to come and stay with
          me.

                         MADGE
          Is that wise? I'm not sure he's
          trained.

                         CAROL
          You think it's too soon.

                         MADGE
          It doesn't matter what I think.

                         CAROL
          It is too soon. But at our age we
          can't afford the luxury of taking
          it slow. And it's either this or
          he goes home and I don't want
          him to go home.
          Madge looks at her for a while. Then smiles.

                         MADGE
          I wish you both the very best.

                         CAROL
          You haven't met anyone?

                         MADGE
          Single by choice. Just not my
          choice.

                         (BEAT)
          I actually think it might be
          over. For me. With men. And if
          that's gone, I'm not quite sure
          what's left.

                         BEAT

                         CAROL
          Did you know Norman brought
          pills? The first night he stayed
          with me?

                         MADGE
          They obviously did the trick.

                         CAROL
          I saw them in his pocket. I
          didn't want it to be like that.
          So when I had the chance I
          swapped them.

                         (BEAT)

          He went all night on two aspirin.

                         (BEAT)
          It's never over.
          Norman appears with his one bag and his battery radio.

                         NORMAN
          Ready?

                         

                         

                         

                         
            107.

          162 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 162

          Sonny roars through the streets on his bike.

          163 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 163

          Evelyn approaches.
          She sees a taxi waiting outside the hotel.

          164 EXT. STAIRCASE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 164

          The houseboy is carrying Douglas and Jean's bags down to
          the car.

          165 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 165

          Evelyn comes into the courtyard. Muriel is sitting there.
          The two women stare at each other.

                         MURIEL
          Do you want him to see you?

          165A EXT. STREET. JAIPUR 165A

          Sonny is waiting at a junction, texting into his mobile
          phone.

          166 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 166

          Douglas is checking they haven't left anything. Jean is at
          the door. She's impatient.

                         JEAN

                         DOUGLAS

          166A INT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 166A

          Sunaina picks up her mobile, looks at the message.

          167 EXT/INT. TAXI/STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 167

          Jean is sitting in the taxi, which is driven by BARUM.
          Douglas climbs in.
          A beat.

                         DOUGLAS
          My wallet, I forgot my wallet.
          One second.
          Before Jean has a chance to say anything, he goes back in.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           108.
          She watches him go.

          168 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 168

          Douglas comes back into the courtyard, heads towards the
          staircase to Evelyn's room.
          Then Muriel speaks from her verandah.

                         MURIEL
          She's not back yet.
          Douglas stops. Beat.

                         DOUGLAS
          Right.

                         (BEAT)
          Then perhaps you could tell her I
          said goodbye.
          He turns and walks out.

          169 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 169

          Evelyn is at her window, listening. She turns to watch him
          leave.

          170 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 170

          Douglas gets back into the taxi.

                         DOUGLAS
          (slamming the door)
          False alarm. Had it the whole
          time. Let's go.

                         171 OMITTED 171

          172 EXT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 172

          Sonny roars into the forecourt, gets off his bike, and runs
          into the building.
          A SECURITY GUARD goes to stop him, but Sonny's already
          running up the stairs.

          172A INT. STAIRWELL/LANDING. CALL CENTRE - DAY 172A

          Sonny keeps going up, floor after floor.

                         SONNY

                         (YELLING)
          Sunaina! Sunaina!
          He reaches the seventh floor.
          Jay appears on the landing above him.

                         JAY
          What's going on?
          Sonny is doubled over, totally out of breath. Holds up a
          finger.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Sonny?

                         SONNY
          I need to see Sunaina!

                         JAY
          Her shift's not over. And when
          it is, she doesn't want to see
          you.
          Beat.

                         SONNY
          Jay, you are the son my mother
          wished I was; an intelligent man,
          with a strong head for business.
          You see things as they are, not
          as you wish them to be. So fuck
          off out of my way.
          Jaydoesn't move.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Or you can give her a message.
          Sunaina is standing against the wall, unseen by Sonny,
          listening.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          Tell her from me what I should
          have told her the day we met.
          What I will announce to anyone
          who asks. And many who do not.
          Sunaina speaks to Jay.

                         SUNAINA
          Including your mother?

                         JAY

                         (TO SONNY)
          Including my mother?

                         SUNAINA
          His mother.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           110.

                         JAY

                         (TO SONNY)
          Your mother.

                         SONNY
          I will tell every mother in the
          land.

                         SUNAINA

                         (TO JAY)
          What will you tell them?

                         JAY

                         (TO SONNY)
          What will you tell them?

                         SONNY
          The only thing that matters in
          this world. That I love you.
          And always will.

                         (BEAT)
          And by you, I mean Sunaina, Jay,
          not you. Although if you are to
          be my brother-in-law, I hope we
          can become better friends.

                         SUNAINA
          Why is he only saying this now?

                         JAY

                         (TO SUNAINA)
          You ask him.

                         SUNAINA
          Why are you only saying this now?

                         SONNY
          Because, Sunaina, love of my
          life, no more will I believe that
          I am not worthy, for only by
          loving you as you deserve will I
          become so.
          On Sunaina's face as she hears this.

          173 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 173

          The cacophonous sound of drumming: a small band of players
          are beating out a deafening, syncopated rhythm as the
          Ganeshi festival begins to unfold.
          Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the
          back. They're speeding through the city.
          Sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street, is
          confronted by a huge traffic jam. The Ganeshi procession is
          bringing everything to a standstill.
          He does a U-turn, speeds off back the way they came.

                         

                         

                         

                         
            111.

          174 INT/EXT. TAXI/STREET - DAY 174

          Douglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam.

                         DOUGLAS
          It's funny. They call it rush
          hour, but nothing actually moves.

                         (BEAT)
          It's not that funny.

                         (BEAT)
          Although I suppose it's all about
          context, isn't it? I mean -

                         JEAN
          Douglas?

                         DOUGLAS
          Yes?

                         JEAN
          If you say one more word, I'll
          kill you with my thumbs.

          174A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 174A

          Muriel sits alone in the courtyard, under her awning.
          Then Carol and Norman appear from reception, followed by
          Mrs Kapoor. They cross towards the arch.

                         MURIEL
          Where d'you think you're going?

                         MADGE
          You may well ask.
          Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree..

                         NORMAN
          We're moving in together.

                         MURIEL
          Already?

                         CAROL
          That point has been made.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          The hotel is closing.

                         MURIEL
          Doesn't have to.
          Silence. Everyone stares at Muriel.
          She takes out the spreadsheets.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           112.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          I've been going over the
          accounts.

          174B EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 174B

          If anything, the traffic is now worse. Jean and Douglas's
          taxi has progressed a few yards, and is now wedged into the
          arch. The Ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far
          entrance to the archway.
          Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead
          and behind.

                         JEAN
          This is ridiculous. It could go
          on for hours. There's no way
          we're ever going to get out of
          here.

                         DOUGLAS
          Maybe there is.
          A rickshaw arrives next to them, swerving through the
          traffic. It is ridden by IFTI.

                         JEAN
          You. Can you get us to the
          airport?

                         IFTI
          Sorry long way sore legs not
          possible.

                         JEAN
          I'll give you everything I have.

                         IFTI
          Step right in mind your head
          let's go.

                         JEAN
          Come on, Douglas. Come on!
          Douglas gets the suitcases out of the trunk of the cab.

                         IFTI
          Sorry no manage people and cases.

                         JEAN
          (grabbing her suitcases)
          What?

                         IFTI
          Not possible. Two person, no
          cases; one person, and cases.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           113.

                         JEAN
          (taking off her watch)
          How about if I give you something
          else? My watch?

                         IFTI

                         (TAKES IT)
          Sure. Thank you. Still not
          possible.

                         DOUGLAS
          We'll get another flight. We can
          go back to the hotel, and leave
          in the morning.

                         JEAN
          No.

                         DOUGLAS
          Jean, you heard what he said. He
          can't do it.

                         JEAN
          He can do one person, and cases.

                         DOUGLAS
          Yes, but

                         JEAN
          Could fate find a better way to
          tell us what we need to hear?

                         DOUGLAS
          Which is what?

                         JEAN
          That it's over. It was over a
          long long time ago.

                         DOUGLAS
          This is not the time to talk
          about this. Let's wait till we

                         GET-

                         JEAN
          I have to go, Douglas.

                         DOUGLAS
          I won't let you.

                         JEAN
          No, you'll want to come after me.
          Chase me to the airport and tell
          me everything will be fine.
          But please don't. Because the
          truth is we both deserve more
          than we've had. You're just too
          kind and too loyal to admit it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           113A.
          Beat.

                         JEAN (CONT'D)
          I will be alright.

                         (SHE SMILES)
          I'm turning left.
          She climbs onto the rickshaw.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           114.
          As the drumming intensifies, Douglas stands holding his
          suitcase, watching her weave through the traffic and out of
          sight.

          174C EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 174C

          Sonny and Sunaina roar towards the hotel, drive into the
          gate and up the path...

          175 EXT. STREET/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 175

          Mrs Kapoor is studying the spreadsheets.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          I don't know what any of these
          figures mean.
          Sonny and Sunaina drive into the courtyard, screech to a
          halt.
          They dismount.

                         SONNY
          Mummyji? Mummyjit

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Right here, you do not need to
          shout.

                         SONNY
          Do you remember what my father
          used to say? That nothing happens
          unless first we dream. Like him
          I have dreamt, Mummyji, and like
          him, I have failed. The Marigold
          Hotel is crumbling into dust.
          And it turns out I can live with
          that. But the one thing I will
          not do is live without this girl.
          To whom I did not introduce you
          properly before.

                         (BEAT)
          This is Sunaina Shantanu Palawat.
          The woman I love, and wish to
          marry.

                         SUNAINA
          I am very pleased to meet you,
          Mrs Kapoor.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           115.
          Sunaina puts out her hand. Mrs Kapoor will not take it.

                         MRS KAPOOR
          (shaking her head)
          No. I forbid it. I forbid this
          match. Utterly and completely.
          Do you hear me, Sonny? This
          cannot happen.
          And then a low, rumbling sound comes from the corner. Like
          a quiet volcano.
          Young Wasim is speaking. It's a long, poetic and heartfelt
          speech.
          Unfortunately it's in Hindi.

                         MADGE
          What is he saying?

                         MURIEL
          What he said to me, I imagine.
          She turns to Sunaina.

                         MURIEL (CON'TD)
          Can you help?

                         SUNAINA
          He is saying . he is saying
          that he has been with this family
          as long as he can remember.
          Given them a lifetime of service.
          And that he remembers another
          fight, between two young people
          and their parents. And he
          remembers the moment where the
          young man stood up to his mother

                         MRS KAPOOR
          . and said yes, I want to marry
          this woman. Yes, she is from a
          different community. But she is
          smart, she is beautiful, and I
          love her.
          Long pause.
          MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
          I don't know who he's talking
          about.
          She offers Sunaina her hand.
          MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
          Take care of my favourite son.
          Sunaina shakes her hand.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           116.

                         NORMAN
          So I'm not clear now. Am I
          staying or going?

                         MURIEL
          Depends how you read the
          accounts.

                         SONNY
          The accounts?

                         MURIEL
          Turns out the original plan is
          good, it works. Just not in the
          hands of an imbecile.

                         SONNY
          I knew that plan was good!

                         MURIEL
          What the place needs is more
          money.

                         SONNY
          Unfortunately my investor, Mr
          Maruthi has decided that while he
          greatly admires my endeavors, he

                         CANNOT -

                         MURIEL
          He's reconsidered.

                         SONNY
          You spoke to him?

                         MURIEL
          So long as there is someone to
          help the manager.

                         SONNY
          The manager needs no help.

                         SUNAINA
          Sonny...

                         SONNY
          The manager needs a little help.

                         MURIEL

                         (TO NORMAN)
          So will you stay?
          Norman looks at Carol.

                         NORMAN
          I'd like to.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           117.

                         CAROL
          In the shack on the roof?

                         NORMAN
          I sleep in the trees.

                         SONNY

                         (TO CAROL)
          We have a double room. Bathroom
          ensuite. And a fully working
          door.
          He points to Graham's room.

                         SONNY (CONT'D)
          A guest has recently checked out.
          Madge can't believe he just said that.

                         CAROL
          I'll think about it.

                         MURIEL

                         (TO MADGE)
          Mrs Hardcastle ? You're staying.

                         MADGE
          On my own?

                         MURIEL
          You're off your game. Lost your
          confidence, maybe. But you're a
          thoroughbred. You'll be back.
          Madge smiles.

                         MURIEL (CON'TD)
          And what about you, Mrs
          Greenslade?
          Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel.

                         EVELYN
          What about me, Mrs Donnelly?

                         MURIEL
          We haven't talked much, you and

          I.

                         EVELYN
          My loss, evidently.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm not sure what I should do.
          Nothing here has quite worked out
          as I hoped.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           117A.

                         MURIEL
          Most things don't. But sometimes
          what happens instead is the good
          stuff.

                         (BEAT)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           118.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          Haven't you got work in the
          morning?
          Evelyn nods.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D)
          Besides, he'll be back.

                         EVELYN
          You don't know him. He's the
          most loyal man I've ever met.

                         MURIEL
          50,000 rupees says I'm right. At
          your current salary that should
          take you three months to pay off.
          Muriel stands up. Everybody stares. She starts to walk
          slowly but proudly across the courtyard. She reaches the
          doorway, turns back.

                         MURIEL
          If you'll excuse me, someone's
          waiting to help me make mango
          chutney. Why did no one tell me
          about that stuff?

                         MRS KAPOOR
          Who is the new assistant manager?

                         MURIEL
          Why? Are you thinking of
          applying for the job?
          She gestures for her wheelchair.
          Sonny rushes up with it. She sinks down.

                         MURIEL (CONT'D))
          That's enough exercise for one
          day.

          175A EXT. AIRPORT ROAD. JAIPUR - EVENING 175A

          Jean sits in the rickshaw, surrounded by her luggage,
          carried by Ifti's strong legs towards her future.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Day 51. The only real failure is
          the failure to try.

          175B INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 175B

          Evelyn is at her computer typing.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           119.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          And the measure of success is how
          we cope with disappointment. As
          we always must.

          175C EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - NIGHT 175C

          Douglas, still holding his suitcase, is surrounded by
          Ganeshi drummers, silhouetted against the lights of the
          city.
          The sound fades as he disappears into the celebration, and
          is replaced by the gentle sound of temple bells, ringing
          for morning prayers.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          We came here, and we tried. All
          of us, in our different ways.

          176 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 176

          Evelyn is still sitting, fully dressed in her room. She's
          been up all night.
          Her alarm clock buzzes. She turns it off.

          177 EXT. EVELYN'S TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 177

          Evelyn comes out of her room, walks across the terrace.

          178 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 178


          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Some achieved more than others.
          but we did our best. Nothing
          else matters.
          Evelyn walks through the courtyard, and on out of the
          hotel.

          179 EXT. GARDEN/PATHWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 179

          Evelyn walks down the path towards the street.
          Then Douglas comes through the gate, with his suitcase.
          They stand there, looking at each other for a moment.

                         EVELYN
          Good morning.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           120.

                         DOUGLAS
          It is, isn't it?

                         EVELYN
          You're still here.

                         DOUGLAS
          I missed the plane.

                         EVELYN
          What about Jean?

                         DOUGLAS
          She didn't.
          Beat.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          (putting down his

                         SUITCASE)
          I had quite an interesting night,
          actually. I met the same taxi
          driver, but this time I let him
          take me to his brother's hotel.
          Which turned out to be less of a
          hotel, and more of a brothel,
          really. They gave me this pipe,
          said it was apple tobacco, but
          that's not what we called it when
          I was a student. So I made my
          excuses and left, wanted some
          time to think. This city at
          night is extraordinary.

                         (BEAT)
          Of course the apple tobacco
          helped.

                         (BEAT)
          Guess what? I finally saw an
          elephant.
          Silence for a bit.

                         EVELYN
          I'm late for work.
          She goes past him.

                         DOUGLAS
          Um ...
          She stops, turns.

                         DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
          What time do you finish?

                         EVELYN
          I get back about 5.

                         DOUGLAS
          Tea time.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           121.

                         EVELYN
          Yes.

                         DOUGLAS
          How do you take it?

                         EVELYN
          With a little milk.
          She turns and walks away.
          She's smiling.

          180 EXT. MARKET, JAIPUR - DAY 180


          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Perhaps it's true: we don't stop
          playing because we grow old, we
          grow old because we stop playing.
          Douglas is haggling with a motorbike mechanic. He seems to
          be having more success with the price than in earlier days.

          180A EXT. ROOFTOP, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 180A

          Carol is lying on Norman's bed, reading a book, while he
          washes his socks in a bucket.

          EVELYN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          All we really know about the
          future is that it will be
          different.

          181 EXT. VICEROY CLUB. JAIPUR - DAY 181

          Madge is chatting vivaciously to someone. It's the elegant
          older man we saw earlier. And he seems utterly smitten.

          EVELYN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          So we must celebrate the changes.

          182 EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 182

          Sonny and Sunaina race through the streets on his
          motorbike. Sonny raises a fist in salute.

          EVELYN (V.0.)
          Let them come. Bring them on.
          Because as someone once said,
          everything will be alright in the
          end ...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          Coming from the other direction, another motorbike, Douglas
          at the handlebars, returning Sonny's greeting.
          And on the pillion seat, riding side-saddle, her scarf
          flying in the breeze, is Evelyn, on her way home from work.
          EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)
          So if it's really not alright,
          then trust me: it's not yet the
          end.
"BIG FISH"

                                        Written by

                                       John August

                                  Based on the novel by

                                      Daniel Wallace

                                  Final Production Draft

                

               This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but 
               truer for their inclusion. 

               FADE IN:

               A RIVER.

               We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.

               This is The Beast.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There are some fish that cannot be 
                         caught. It's not that they're faster 
                         or stronger than other fish. They're 
                         just touched by something extra. 
                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One 
                         such fish was The Beast.

               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited 
               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past 
               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         By the time I was born, he was already 
                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. 
                         Some said that fish was the ghost of 
                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned 
                         in that river 60 years before. Others 
                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, 
                         left over from the Cretaceous period.

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)

               WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD 
               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, 
               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with 
               absolute conviction.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't put any stock into such 
                         speculation or superstition. All I 
                         knew was I'd been trying to catch 
                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger 
                         than you.
                              (closer)
                         And on the day you were born, that 
                         was the day I finally caught him.

               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)

               A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES 
               as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I'd tried everything on it: 
                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut 
                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I 
                         had a revelation: if that fish was 
                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait 
                         wasn't going to work. I would have 
                         to use something he truly desired.

               Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.

                                     LITTLE BRAVE
                              (confused)
                         Your finger?

               Edward slips his ring off.

                                     EDWARD
                         Gold.

               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks 
               bored. He's heard this story before.

                                     EDWARD
                         I tied my ring to the strongest line 
                         they made -- strong enough to hold 
                         up a bridge, they said, if just for 
                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

               INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)

               Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming 
               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of 
               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.

                                     EDWARD (CONT'D)
                         The Beast jumped up and grabbed it 
                         before the ring even hit the water. 
                         And just as fast, he snapped clean 
                         through that line.

               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His 
               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and 
               practicality -- stands with him at the door.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can see my predicament. My wedding 
                         ring, the symbol of fidelity to my 
                         wife, soon to be the mother of my 
                         child, was now lost in the gut of an 
                         uncatchable fish.

               ON WILL AND SANDRA

                                     WILL
                              (low but insistent)
                         Make him stop.

               His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.

                                     WILL'S DATE
                         What did you do?

                                     EDWARD
                         I followed that fish up-river and 
                         down-river for three days and three 
                         nights, until I finally had him boxed 
                         in.

               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.

                                     EDWARD
                         With these two hands, I reached in 
                         and snatched that fish out of the 
                         river. I looked him straight in the 
                         eye. And I made a remarkable 
                         discovery.

               INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)

               WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This 
               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and 
               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is 
               cozy and drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         This fish, the Beast. The whole time 
                         we were calling it a him, when in 
                         fact it was a her. It was fat with 
                         eggs, and was going to lay them any 
                         day.

               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from 
               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier 
               if this were her own wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I was in a situation. I could 
                         gut that fish and get my ring back, 
                         but doing so I would be killing the 
                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, 
                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.

               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, 
               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
                         born son the chance to catch a fish 
                         like this of his own? This lady fish 
                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.

               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --

                                     EDWARD AND WILL
                         We were part of the same equation.

               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Honey, it's still your night.

               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, you may well ask, since this 
                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, 
                         why did it strike so quick on gold 
                         when nothing else would attract it?
                              (closer; he holds up 
                              his ring)
                         That was the lesson I learned that 
                         day, the day my son was born.

               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has 
               always been -- about her more than anyone.

                                     EDWARD
                         Sometimes, the only way to catch an 
                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a 
                         wedding ring.

               A LAUGH from the crowd.

               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she 
               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not 
               lessened their affection for each other.

               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.

               The crowd APPLAUDS.

               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for 
               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

               Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

               EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT

               We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. 
               Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more 
               heated. Both men are a little drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         What, a father's not allowed to talk 
                         about his son?

                                     WILL
                              (disbelieving)
                         I am a footnote in that story. I am 
                         the context for your great adventure. 
                         Which never happened! Incidentally! 
                         You were selling novelty products in 
                         Wichita the day I was born.

                                     EDWARD
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus Christ.

                                     WILL
                         Friend of yours? Did you help him 
                         out of a bind?

                                     EDWARD
                         Come on, Will. Everyone likes that 
                         story.

                                     WILL
                         No Dad, they don't. I do not like 
                         the story. Not anymore, not after a 
                         thousand times. I know all the 
                         punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as 
                         well as you can.
                              (closer)
                         For one night, one night in your 
                         entire life, the universe does not 
                         revolve around Edward Bloom. It 
                         revolves around me and my wife. How 
                         can you not understand that?

               A long beat, then...

                                     EDWARD
                              (low)
                         Sorry to embarrass you.

               Will won't let him get the last word.

                                     WILL
                         You're embarrassing yourself, Dad. 
                         You just don't see it.

               ANGLE ON Edward. Fine. A hand to wave, enough of you.

               He walks away.

               ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. It's then 
               we FREEZE FRAME.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         After that night, I didn't speak to 
                         my father again for three years.

               INT. A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY

               A typically busy day. On hold with the phone cradled under 
               an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his 
               desk.

                                     WILL (ON PHONE)
                              (without pauses)
                         William Bloom with the Associated 
                         Press if I could just...

               He's put back on hold. Returning to the mail, he finds a 
               hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         We communicated indirectly I guess. 
                         In her letters and Christmas cards, 
                         my mother would write for both of 
                         them.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a 
               sandwich.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         When I'd call, Mom would say that 
                         Dad was out driving. Or swimming in 
                         the pool.

               Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.

                                     WILL
                         True to form, we never talked about 
                         our not talking.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sandra stands by the window, watching as...

               EXT. BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I didn't see anything 
                         of myself in my father, and I don't 
                         think he saw anything of himself in 
                         me. We were like strangers who knew 
                         each other very well.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         In telling the story of my father's 
                         life, it's impossible to separate 
                         the fact from the fiction, the man 
                         from the myth. The best I can do is 
                         to tell it the way he told me.

               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught 
               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something 
               changes.

               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 
               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not 
               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         It doesn't always make sense, and 
                         most of it never happened.

               Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, 
               grabbing hold of

               THE BEAST.

               He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the 
               eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         But that's what kind of story this 
                         is.

               Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back 
               into the water with a splash.

               TITLE OVER:

                                         BIG FISH

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's 
               flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting 
               bedside manner...

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to 
                         give me one good push. On three. 
                         One...

               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets 
               into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold 
               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up 
               into air.

               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one 
               can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we 
               can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

               As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides 
               it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races 
               after it.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Bursting through the doors --

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Grab that baby!

               A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets 
               out a collective sigh of relief.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         My father's birth would set the pace 
                         for his unlikely life. No longer 
                         than most men's, but larger. And as 
                         strange as his stories got, the 
                         endings were always the most 
                         surprising of all.

               INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY

               Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the 
               tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has 
               that insistent European sound.

               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly 
               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in 
               its carton.

               KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings 
               open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of 
               groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife 
               Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Allo oui?

               Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer 
               unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a 
               reaction out of Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (on phone)
                         Yes, he's here.

               She hands the phone to Will, concerned.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's your mother.

               Half-stripped, Will takes the phone. This won't be good news.

                                     WILL
                              (on phone)
                         Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

               As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, 
               very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the 
               conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.

                                     WILL (CONT'D)
                         What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, 
                         sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.

               He covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's bad.

                                     WILL
                         It's more than they thought. They're 
                         going to stop chemo.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You need to go.

                                     WILL
                         Probably tonight.

               A beat.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm going with you.

                                     WILL
                         You don't have to.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (a simple fact)
                         I'm going with you.

               INT. AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT

               As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the 
               welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach. 
               Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.

               Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him. There's an 
               effortless intimacy between them. She can pinpoint what he's 
               feeling before he can.

               INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHT

               Hours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS 
               are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against 
               Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.

               Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then 
               he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.

               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands 
               to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good, 
               making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a 
               dog.

               We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.

                                     EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
                         So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey 
                         in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?

               Focusing on the final shadow, we...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT

               ...come to find Edward making the shapes.

               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The 
               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big 
               shadows on the wall.

                                     WILL
                         The one about the witch.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mom says I can't tell you that 
                         one anymore. You get nightmares.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not scared.

               Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in 
               earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.

                                     EDWARD
                         Neither was I. At first.

               Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

                                     EDWARD
                         This all happened in the swamp outside 
                         of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to 
                         go out in the swamp, on account of 
                         the snakes and spiders and quicksand 
                         that would swallow you up before you 
                         could even scream. But there were 
                         five of us out there that night: Me, 
                         Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price 
                         Brothers, Don and Zacky.

               Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.

                                     EDWARD
                         Not a one of us knew what was in 
                         store.

               As his hand moves past the light, we

                                                                   COME TO:

               A flashlight SWEEPS past. We are...

               EXT. FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT

               The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs 
               low, casting long shadows.

               Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on. 
               The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

                                     EDWARD
                         Zacky, turn your flashlight on!

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't got any batteries!

               Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10. His brother DON PRICE is 12, 
               and a lot bigger than the others. 

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then why'd you bring it?

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't want to be in the swamp with 
                         a witch and no flashlight.

               WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a 
               sharecropper. Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to 
               be there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Is it true she got a glass eye?

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I heard she got it from Gypsies.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's a Gypsy?

                                     ZACKY
                         Your momma's a Gypsy.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Your momma's a bitch.

                                     RUTHIE
                         You shouldn't swear. There's ladies 
                         present.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Shit.

                                     ZACKY
                         Damn.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         Screw.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         Turn off your flashlights! She'll 
                         see 'em.

               MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates 
               of...

               EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Now, it's common knowledge that most 
                         towns of a certain size have a witch, 
                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard. Witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile.

               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically 
               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie 
               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it.

               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows 
               what is lurking in the shadows?

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, 
                         there was one who was the most feared. 
                         For she had one glass eye, which was 
                         said to contain mystical powers.

               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I hear if you look right at it, you 
                         can see how you're gonna die.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's 
                         not even a real witch.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You're so sure, why don't you go in 
                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps 
                         it in a box on her nighttable.

               Edward looks back at the spooky house.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Or are you too scared?

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll go in right now and get that 
                         eye.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I will.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Fine, you do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I'm doing it.

               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.

                                     RUTHIE
                         Edward, don't!

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         She'll make soap out of you!
                              (to Ruthie)
                         That's what she does, she makes soap 
                         out of people.

               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, 
               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.

               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. 
               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don 
               holds him by the collar.

               EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE

               Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front 
               door. Anything could jump out of them.

               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he 
               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. 
               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look 
               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and 
               closer before he finally

               RINGS THE DOORBELL.

               Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with 
               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead 
               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.

                                     EDWARD
                              (calm and 
                              straightforward)
                         Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and 
                         there's some folks'd like to see 
                         your eye.

               EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more 
               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the 
               gate.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You get the eye?

                                     EDWARD
                         I brought it.

                                     DON PRICE
                              (dubious)
                         Let's see it.

               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping 
               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left 
               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY

               An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing 
               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. 
               Dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               We RUSH IN on Don Price.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

               Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, 
               face mushed in the grout. Very much dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears 
               in his eyes.

                                     ZACKY
                         I saw how I was gonna die. I was 
                         old, and I fell.

                                     DON PRICE
                         I wasn't old at all.

               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old 
               Woman, Edward smiles.

               EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT

               Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but 
               curiosity gets the better of him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was thinking about death and all. 
                         About seeing how you're gonna die.

               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I mean, on one hand, if dying was 
                         all you thought about, it could kind 
                         of screw you up. But it could kind 
                         of help you, couldn't it? Because 
                         you'd know that everything else you 
                         can survive.

               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.

                                     EDWARD
                         I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.

               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. 
               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks 
               into The Eye.

               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he 
               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and 
               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. 
               His future has something strange in store.

                                     EDWARD
                         Huh. That's how I go?

               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns 
               and leaves.

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I no longer 
                         feared death. And for that, I was as 
                         good as immortal.

               As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY

               The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the 
               porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), 
               surprised and a little annoyed.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get here?

                                     WILL
                         We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that 
                         big really.

                                     SANDRA
                         Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up 
                         at the airport.

                                     WILL
                         We rented a car.

                                     SANDRA
                              (simply)
                         You didn't need to do that. You just 
                         didn't.

               A beat. Starting over...

                                     WILL
                         Hi, Mom.

               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son 
               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- 
               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm so glad you're here.

               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --

                                     SANDRA
                         You shouldn't have flown. But...

               They hug.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's good to see you. You look 
                         beautiful.

               It's not flattery. It's the truth.

                                     SANDRA
                         Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Yes.

                                     SANDRA
                         Down the hall on the right. The door 
                         sticks. You have to really pull it.

               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. 
               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra 
               follows him.

               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the 
               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for 
               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are 
               playing on the street.

                                     WILL
                         Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's up with your father.

               Heading back to the house...

                                     WILL
                         How is he?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's impossible. He won't eat. And 
                         because he won't eat, he gets weaker. 
                         And because he's weaker, he doesn't 
                         want to eat.

                                     WILL
                         How much time does he have left?

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't talk about those things. 
                         Not yet.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded 
               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black 
               physician. He's still the town's best physician.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.
                              (they shake)
                         My wife, Josephine.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         A pleasure.

               He judges her belly.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         You're seven months.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (impressed)
                         To the day.

               He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's a boy.

               She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- 
               what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.

               Back to the main subject...

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't think he looks any worse.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         No. I would say he's the same.

               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't 
               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

                                     WILL
                         Can I see him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Absolutely. Be good for you to talk 
                         to him.

               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't 
               spoken in years.

               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the 
               counter.

                                     SANDRA
                         Get him to drink one of these. He 
                         won't, but tell him he has to.

               INT. FOYER - DAY

               Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. 
               They CREAK with every step.

               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most 
               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant 
               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can 
               see him growing up with every step.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the 
               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand 
               along the wallpaper.

               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. 
               Then goes inside.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not 
               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. 
               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.

               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.

               Coming up to the bed --

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries 
               to say something, but no words come out.

               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him 
               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, 
               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.

               Finally...

                                     EDWARD
                         You --
                              (he points)
                         -- are in for a surprise.

                                     WILL
                         Am I?

                                     EDWARD
                         Having a kid changes everything. I 
                         mean, there's the diapers and the 
                         burping and the midnight feedings...

                                     WILL
                         Did you do any of that?

                                     EDWARD
                         No, but I hear it's terrible. Then 
                         you spend years trying to corrupt 
                         and mislead this child, fill its 
                         head with nonsense and still it turns 
                         out perfectly fine.

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm up for it?

                                     EDWARD
                         You learned from the best.

               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers 
               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.

                                     WILL
                         Just drink half the can. I'll tell 
                         her you drank the whole thing. 
                         Everyone wins.

               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open 
               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.

                                     EDWARD
                         People needn't worry so much. It's 
                         not my time yet. This isn't how I 
                         go.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

                                     WILL
                         The Old Lady by the swamp.

                                     EDWARD
                         She was a witch.

                                     WILL
                         No, she was old and probably senile. 
                         Maybe schizophrenic.

                                     EDWARD
                         I saw my death in that eye. And this 
                         is not how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         So how does it happen?

                                     EDWARD
                         Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to 
                         ruin it for you.

               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, 
               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.

                                     EDWARD
                         There was this panhandler who used 
                         to stop me every morning when I came 
                         out of this coffee shop near the 
                         office.

                                     WILL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         And every day I gave him a quarter. 
                         Every day. Then I got sick and was 
                         out for a couple of weeks. And when 
                         I went back there, you know what he 
                         said?

                                     WILL
                         What did he say?

                                     EDWARD
                         You owe me three-fifty.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         True story.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         When did you ever work in an office?

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a lot you don't know about 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         You're right.

               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother was worried we wouldn't 
                         talk again. And look at us. We're 
                         talking fine. We're storytellers, 
                         both of us. I speak mine out, you 
                         write yours down. Same thing.

               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about 
                         some things while I'm here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mean, while I'm here.

                                     WILL
                         I'd just like to know the true 
                         versions of things. Events. Stories. 
                         You.

               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING 
               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. 
               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from 
               talking.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother hasn't been keeping up 
                         the pool. If you wanted to you 
                         could...

                                     WILL
                         I will.

                                     EDWARD
                         You know where the chemicals are?

                                     WILL
                         I used to do it when you were gone, 
                         remember? I used to do it a lot.

               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...

                                     EDWARD
                         I was never much for being at home, 
                         Will. It's too confining. And this, 
                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is 
                         the worst thing that ever happened 
                         to me.

               He smiles at his joke.

                                     WILL
                         I thought you weren't dying.

                                     EDWARD
                         I said this isn't how I go. The last 
                         part is much more unusual. Trust me 
                         on that.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of 
               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.

               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he 
               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]

               ...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his 
               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's 
               showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have 
                         to be home for a week.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's nothing. I once had to stay 
                         in bed for three years.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Did you have chicken pox?

                                     EDWARD
                         I wish.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TINY CHURCH - DAY

               Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 
               10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the 
               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it 
               his all.

               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then 
               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, 
               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps 
               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting 
               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to 
               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more 
               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.

               ON HIS SHOES

               As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's 
               how fast he's growing.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Truth is, no one quite knew what was 
                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up 
                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.

               INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various 
               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen 
               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         My muscles couldn't keep up with my 
                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up 
                         with my body's ambition. So I spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed, with the World 
                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means 
                         of exploration. I had made it all 
                         the way to the "G's," hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism, 
                         when I uncovered an article about 
                         the common goldfish.

               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.

                                     YOUNG EDWARD
                              (reading)
                         "Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish 
                         will remain small. With more space, 
                         the fish can grow double, triple, or 
                         quadruple its size."

               Young Edward thinks this through.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It occurred to me then, that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that I 
                         was intended for larger things. After 
                         all, a giant man can't have an 
                         ordinary-sized life.

               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

               The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The 
               crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds 
               the bases.

               Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first 
               real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from 
               roughly the ages of 18 to 30.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As soon as my bones had settled in 
                         their adult configuration, I set 
                         upon my plan to make a bigger place 
                         for myself in Ashton.

               EXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY

               SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. 
               On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret 
               love:

                                     GIRL
                         Edward Bloom!

               The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, 
               glowers.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP 
               to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of 
               his teenage EMPLOYEES.

               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom 
               Landscaping." He has workers on every lawn.

               He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.

               INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other 
               end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.

               As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only 
               teammate who doesn't mob him.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

               INT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY

               Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine 
               labelled "Perpetual Motion." He and the JUDGE pose for a 
               photograph. A FLASH.

               Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the 
               trash.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY

               A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain 
               call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don 
               Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

               Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

               EXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY

               Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was the biggest thing Ashton had 
                         ever seen. Until one day, a stranger 
                         arrived.

               EXT. FARM - DAY

               As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a 
               massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly 
               the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

               EXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY

               Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They 
               BLEAT in panic as

               TWO OVERSIZED HANDS

               reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're 
               carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the 
               full stranger.

               EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY

               A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. 
               Amid the crowd we see Don Price.

                                     SHARECROPPER
                         He ate an entire cornfield!

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         He ate my dog!

                                     HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER
                         If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor, 
                         we will!

                                     MAYOR
                         I won't have mob violence in this 
                         town. Now, has someone tried talking 
                         to him?

                                     SOME FARMER
                         You can't reason with 'im!

                                     SHEPHARD
                         He's a monster!

               Agreement from the crowd. And then...

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                         I'll do it.

               Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal 
               none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll talk to him. See if I can get 
                         him to move on.

                                     MAYOR
                         Son, that creature could crush you 
                         without trying.

                                     EDWARD
                         Trust me, he'll have to try.

               EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

               Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching 
               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the 
               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked 
               clean.

               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

                                     EDWARD
                         Hello!

               There's no answer.

                                     EDWARD
                         My name is Edward Bloom! I want to 
                         talk to you!

               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         GO AWAY!

               The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair 
               back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself.

               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward 
               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's 
               going to take.

               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even 
               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't 
                         kill me. All the same, I preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken.

               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams 
               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not 
               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living 
               in his matted hair.

               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his 
               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice 
               it.

                                     KARL
                         Why are you here?

               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...

                                     EDWARD
                         So you can eat me. The town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice, and I 
                         volunteered.

               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.

                                     EDWARD
                         My arms are a little stringy, but 
                         there's some good eating on my legs. 
                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them 
                         myself.
                              (beat)
                         So I guess, just, if you could get 
                         it over with quick. Because I'm not 
                         much for pain, really.

               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. 
               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see 
               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking 
               his chops --

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I can't go back. I'm a human 
                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone 
                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd 
                         rather be dinner than a coward.

               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

                                     EDWARD
                         Here, start with my hand. It'll be 
                         an appetizer.

               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But 
               the giant spits it back out.

                                     KARL
                         I don't want to eat you. I don't 
                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get 
                         so hungry. I'm too big.

               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- 
               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

               Edward takes a seat beside him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you ever think maybe you're not 
                         too big? Maybe this town's just too 
                         small. I mean, look at it.

               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hardly two stories in the whole place. 
                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've 
                         got buildings so tall you can't even 
                         see the tops of 'em.

                                     KARL
                         Really?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got 
                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat 
                         a lot, can't you?

                                     KARL
                         I can.

                                     EDWARD
                         So why are you wasting your time in 
                         a small town? You're a big man. You 
                         should be in the big city.

               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --

                                     KARL
                         You're just trying to get me to leave, 
                         aren't you? That's why they sent you 
                         here.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's your name, Giant?

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do 
                         want you to leave, Karl. But I want 
                         to leave with you.
                              (closer)
                         You think this town is too small for 
                         you, well, it's too small for a man 
                         of my ambition. I can't see staying 
                         here a day longer.

                                     KARL
                         You don't like it?

                                     EDWARD
                         I love every square inch of it. But 
                         I can feel the edges closing in on 
                         me. A man's life can only grow to a 
                         certain size in a place like this.
                              (beat)
                         So what do you say? Join me?

               Karl thinks a moment. Then --

                                     KARL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         Okay.

               They shake on it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now first, we gotta get you ready 
                         for the city.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, 
               while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.

               EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY

               Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the 
               good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and 
               Karl.

               There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.

                                     MAYOR
                              (loudly, for the crowd)
                         Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, 
                         it's with a heavy heart we see you 
                         go. But take with you this Key to 
                         the City, and know that any time you 
                         want to come back, all our doors are 
                         open to you.

               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his 
               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start 
               walking, waving as they go.

               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward 
               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he 
               could crush Edward.

               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or 
               shake his hand.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         That afternoon as I left Ashton, 
                         everyone seemed to have advice.

                                     VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
                         Find yourself a nice girl! Don't 
                         trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your 
                         pride, Edward Bloom!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         But there was one person whose counsel 
                         I held above all others.

               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with

               THE OLD WOMAN.

               The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been 
               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper 
               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear 
               her voice.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         She said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never 
                         being caught.

               The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to the Old Woman)
                         Okay. Thanks.

               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

                                     KARL
                         What did she say?

                                     EDWARD
                         Beats me.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking 
               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There were two roads out of Ashton, 
                         a new one which was paved, and an 
                         older one that wasn't. People didn't 
                         use the old road anymore, and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted.

               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Since I had no intention of ever 
                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road.

               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

                                     KARL
                         You know anyone's who's taken it?

                                     EDWARD
                         That poet, Norther Winslow did. He 
                         was going to Paris, France. He must 
                         have liked it, because no one ever 
                         heard from him again.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what. You take the other 
                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet 
                         you on the far side.

               A little paranoid...

                                     KARL
                         You're not trying to run away?

                                     EDWARD
                         Just to be sure, you can take my 
                         pack.

               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

               The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is 
               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's 
               a day meant for whistling.

               EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH

               The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the 
               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.

               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny 
               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is 
               dead quiet.

               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It 
               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.

               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.

               FURTHER ALONG

               A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING 
               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them.

               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands.

                                     EDWARD
                         You stupid sonofa...

               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm 
               roars out.

               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]

               Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.

               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. 
               Reads it:

                                         WARNING!

                                     JUMPING SPIDERS!

               Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         he's made a terrible mistake. The 
                         truth is, I was never a reasonable 
                         man.

               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

                                     EDWARD
                         And what I recalled of Sunday School 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became, the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end.

               EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY

               Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in 
               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he 
               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty 
               and comforting.

               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- 
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their 
               laces tied together.

               He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"

               EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY

               It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, 
               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is 
               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group 
               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. 
               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.

               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Friend!

               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store 
               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Welcome to ya. What's your name?

                                     EDWARD
                         Edward Bloom.

               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips 
               forward a few pages. Still looking...

                                     BEAMEN
                         Bloom like a flower?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. 
                         We weren't expecting you yet.

               Still confused...

                                     EDWARD
                         You were expecting me?

                                     BEAMEN
                         Not yet.

               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:

                                     MILDRED
                         You must have taken a shortcut.

                                     EDWARD
                         I did. It nearly killed me.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And 
                         truthfully, the long way is easier, 
                         but it's longer.

                                     MILDRED
                         Much longer.

                                     BEAMEN
                         And you're here now, and that's what 
                         matters.

               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering 
               around to look at the handsome stranger.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is this place?

                                     BEAMEN
                         The town of Spectre. Best kept secret 
                         in Alabama. Says here you're from 
                         Ashton, right? Last person we had 
                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD
                         The poet? What ever happened to him?

                                     BEAMEN
                         He's still here. Let me buy you a 
                         drink. I'll tell you all about it. 
                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.

                                     EDWARD
                         No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm 
                         already running late.

               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's 
               laughing.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Son, I already told you. You're early.

               INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of 
               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), 
               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never 
               left the state.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Now tell me if that isn't the best 
                         pie you ever ate.

                                     EDWARD
                         It truly is.

               UNDER THE TABLE

               Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Everything here tastes better. Even 
                         the water is sweet. Never gets too 
                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night 
                         the wind goes through the trees and 
                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony 
                         out there, playing just for you.

               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the 
               door.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hey!

               He chases after her.

               EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY

               As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching 
               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the 
               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever 
               getting them down.

               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is 
               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his 
               hand.

               Still focused on his shoes...

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I need those!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There is no softer ground than town.

                                     MILDRED
                         That rhymes!

                                     BEAMEN
                         He is our poet laureate.

               The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... 

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit 
                         places that seem instantly familiar, 
                         filled with friends you've never 
                         met.

               EXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK

               Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. 
               Thousands of them.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A man might travel his entire life 
                         and never find a place so inviting. 
                         My journey had scarcely begun, and I 
                         had arrived.

               Norther hands him his noteboook.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I've been working on this poem for 
                         12 years.

                                     EDWARD
                         Really.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There's a lot of expectation. I don't 
                         want to disappoint my fans.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's only three lines long.

               Norther grabs his notebook back.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is why you don't show work in 
                         progress.

                                     EDWARD
                         Norther, do you ever regret not making 
                         it to Paris?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I can't imagine any place better 
                         than here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're a poet. You oughta be able 
                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, 
                         you could.

               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT

               By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the 
               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City 
               dangles around his neck.

               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.

               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.

               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming 
               underwater. We never see her face.

               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his 
               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's 
               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he 
               frighten her away.

               Then he sees the snake.

               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.

               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward 
               dives in. He swims as hard as can,

               GRABBING THE SNAKE

               just as it's about to strike.

               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her.

                                     EDWARD
                         No, it's okay! I got it. I got the 
                         snake.

               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common 
               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.

               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover 
               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her 
               face.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she 
               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what 
               tricks his eyes are playing on him.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                     A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         There's leeches in there!

               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you see that woman?

                                     JENNY
                         What did she look like?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, she... uh...

                                     JENNY
                         Was she nekkid?

               Embarrassed to admit it...

                                     EDWARD
                         Yeah.

                                     JENNY
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No 
                         one ever catches her.

               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow 
               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.

                                     JENNY (CONT'D)
                         Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent 
                         people. My daddy said it looked like 
                         the coon dog he had when he was kid, 
                         back from the dead.

               Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He 
               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging 
               to his skin.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shoot.

               He starts to work pulling them off.

               EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT

               Edward and Jenny walk back.

                                     JENNY
                         How old are you?

                                     EDWARD
                         Eighteen.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm eight. That means when I'm 
                         eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 
                         28, you'll only be 38.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a little wary)
                         You're pretty good at arithmetic.

                                     JENNY
                         And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And 
                         that's not much difference at all.

               Eager to get off this subject...

                                     EDWARD
                         Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" 
               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables 
               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one 
               end to hold FIDDLERS.

               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, 
               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed 
               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and 
               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants 
               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.

               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.

               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear 
               over the MUSIC.

                                     MILDRED
                         Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. 
                         We all do.

                                     EDWARD
                              (not hearing)
                         What?

                                     MILDRED
                         I said you're quite a catch!

               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have to leave. Tonight.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Why?

                                     EDWARD
                         This town is everything a man could 
                         ask for. And if I were to end up 
                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But 
                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up 
                         anywhere.

                                     BEAMEN
                         No one's ever left.

                                     JENNY
                         How are you gonna make it without 
                         your shoes?

                                     EDWARD
                         I suspect it will hurt a lot.

               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople 
               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.

               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.

                                     BEAMEN
                              (calling after him)
                         You won't find a better place!

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't expect to.

               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.

                                     JENNY
                         Promise me you'll come back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I promise. Someday. When I'm really 
                         supposed to.

               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps 
               walking. 

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. 
               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.

               And then it gets worse.

               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood 
               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying 
               to block him.

               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for 
               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now 
               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As difficult as it was to reach 
                         Spectre, I was fated to get there 
                         eventually. After all, no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life.

               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the 
               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally 
               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.

               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees 
               have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush 
               him.

               He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.

                                     EDWARD
                         And then I realized, this wasn't the 
                         end of my life.

               With a sudden calm...

                                     EDWARD
                              (aloud)
                         This isn't how I die.

               Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back 
               where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn 
               in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.

               EXT. THE ROAD - DAY

               His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

                                     A DEEP VOICE
                         Friend!

               Edward turns to see

               KARL

               to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.

                                     KARL
                         What happened to your shoes?

               Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.

                                     EDWARD
                         They got ahead of me.

               With that, the men start walking down the larger road.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra 
               and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small 
               plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's 
               exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain 
               the family dinner ritual.

               The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a 
               knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know if you've seen it, but 
                         Josephine has some photos in the 
                         most recent Newsweek.

                                     SANDRA
                         Really! That's wonderful.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I spent a week in Morocco for the 
                         story. It was incredible.

                                     SANDRA
                         We'll have to pick up a copy.

               A beat. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward 
               suddenly speaks:

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't know if you're aware of this, 
                         Josephine, but African parrots, in 
                         their native home of the Congo -- 
                         they speak only French.

               All three stop to listen.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (amused)
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're lucky to get four words out 
                         of them in English. But if you were 
                         to walk through the jungle, you'd 
                         hear them speaking the most elaborate 
                         French. Those parrots talk about 
                         everything: politics, movies, fashion -- 
                         everything but religion.

               Taking the bait...

                                     WILL
                         Why not religion, Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         It's rude to talk about religion. 
                         You never know who you're going to 
                         offend.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine actually went to the Congo 
                         last year.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh, so you know.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his 
               mother checks her list.

               AT THE PRODUCE SECTION

               Sandra starts to bag string beans.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, would you say you understand 
                         Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Of course.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, do you really know 
                         what's going on in his head? 

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                         How is that possible? I mean, you 
                         try to ask him a question and suddenly 
                         it's another one of his stories.
                              (decidedly)
                         You can't honestly say you know him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume 
                         things you don't know.

               She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous 
               territory.

                                     SANDRA
                         Would you say you understand 
                         Josephine?

                                     WILL
                         Yes. But that's a different...

                                     SANDRA
                         No it's not. It's exactly the same. 
                         Your father and I met, we dated, and 
                         we married -- we chose each other -- 
                         because we understood each other on 
                         some fundamental level. Just the 
                         same as you two.

               She moves on to the carrots.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine and I have a lot in common.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, you both think William Bloom is 
                         a very smart man.
                              (beat)
                         The problem is, you only see me as 
                         your mother, and not as someone's 
                         wife. And I've been his wife longer 
                         than I've been your mother. You can't 
                         discount that.

                                     WILL
                         True. But I've known him my whole 
                         life, and I don't feel like I know 
                         him at all. Or ever will.

               With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

                                     SANDRA
                         I know it's not easy. Just remember, 
                         he didn't choose to be your father 
                         and you didn't choose to be his son. 
                         You just ended up together. You could 
                         pick numbers out of a dark bag and 
                         it'd be just the same. If you ask 
                         me, it's a wonder parents and children 
                         can stand each other at all.

                                     WILL
                         But I understand you, Mom. I always 
                         have.

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not 
                         the mystery you're trying to solve 
                         right now.

               INT. AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT

               Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is 
               approaching with a Newsweek magazine.

               Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's

               is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she 
               carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans 
               and sneakers.

               She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes. 
               We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra. 
               It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or 
               just find him attractive?

               Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.

               Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

                                     SANDRA
                         Before I forget, your father has 
                         papers in the basement I'd like you 
                         to go through. I wouldn't know what's 
                         important.

                                     WILL
                              (distracted)
                         Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde 
                         hair.

               Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, 
               semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, 
               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.

                                     SANDRA
                              (no idea)
                         Was she one of your teachers?

                                     WILL
                         No. But it's weird. She seemed to 
                         recognize me.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to the cashier)
                         Do you know who that is?

               The Cashier turns to look. He can only get a profile as the 
               woman leaves.

                                     CASHIER
                         Never seen her before. Pretty, though.

               INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the 
               RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, 
               just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his 
               back.

               At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches 
               over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence -- 
               he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                              (playfully lecherous)
                         Hello.

               She smiles.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Hi. How are you feeling?

                                     EDWARD
                         I was dreaming.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What were you dreaming about?

               He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine 
               motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't usually remember unless 
                         they're especially portentous. You 
                         know what that word means, portentous?

               She shakes her head.

                                     EDWARD
                         Means when you dream about something 
                         that's going to happen.
                              (beat, gathering)
                         Like one night, I had a dream where 
                         this crow came and told me, "Your 
                         Aunt is going to die." I was so scared 
                         I woke up my parents. They told me 
                         it was just a dream, to go back to 
                         bed. But the next morning, my Aunt 
                         Stacy was dead.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         That's terrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Terrible for her, but think about 
                         me, young boy with that kind of power. 
                         Wasn't three weeks later that the 
                         crow came back to me in a dream and 
                         said, "Your Grampa is going to die." 
                         Well, I ran right back to my parents. 
                         My father said, no, Gramps is fine, 
                         but I could see there was trepidation. 
                         And true enough, that next morning 
                         my Grampa was dead.

               He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

                                     EDWARD
                         For the next couple weeks, I didn't 
                         have another dream. Until one night 
                         the crow came back and said, "Your 
                         Daddy is going to die."
                              (beat)
                         Well, I didn't know what to do. But 
                         finally I told my father. And he 
                         said not to worry, but I could tell 
                         he was rattled. That next day, he 
                         wasn't himself, always looking around, 
                         waiting for something to drop on his 
                         head. Because the crow didn't tell 
                         how it was going to happen, just 
                         those words: your Daddy is going to 
                         die. Well, he went into town early 
                         and was gone for a long time. And 
                         when he finally came back, he looked 
                         terrible, like he was waiting for 
                         the axe to fall all day. He said to 
                         my mother, "Good God. I just had the 
                         worst day of my life."
                              (beat)
                         "You think you've had a bad day," 
                         she said. "This morning the milkman 
                         dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine 
                         smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him 
                         smiling too.

               A long beat. Then, deadpan...

                                     EDWARD
                         Because see, my mother was banging 
                         the milkman.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No, I understand.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was slipping her a little extra 
                         cream.

               She nods, a bit more of a laugh.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was filling her basket. He was 
                         making deliveries around back.

               As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, 
               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was buttering her rolls. Pumping 
                         her churn. Splashing milk in her 
                         box.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Stop.

                                     EDWARD
                         They were squeezing the cheese. 
                         Clanking the bottles. Licking the 
                         popsicle.

               She's starting to cry from laughing.

                                     EDWARD
                         Cracking the eggs and making an 
                         omelet.

               With that, he stops. She regains her composure.

                                     EDWARD
                         Spooning the sherbet.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (interrupting)
                         Can I take your picture?

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't need a picture. Just look 
                         up handsome in the dictionary.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Please?

               He rolls his eyes, why not.

               Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. 
               We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         I have photos from the wedding to 
                         show you. There's a great one of you 
                         and my father. I had an extra print 
                         made.

               Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding 
               how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

               He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I want to see pictures of your 
                         wedding. I've never seen any.

               She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job 
               masking the pain.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's because we didn't have a 
                         wedding. Your mother-in-law was never 
                         supposed to marry me. She was engaged 
                         to somebody else.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (loading film)
                         I never knew.

                                     EDWARD
                         Will never told you that?
                              (she shakes her head)
                         Probably just as well. He would have 
                         told it all wrong anyway. All the 
                         facts and none of the flavor.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Oh, so this is a tall tale?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, it's not a short one.

               A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the 
               whirling fan.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               SPINNING PINWHEEL

               held by a LITTLE BOY. He's slumped over his FATHER's shoulder, 
               being carried towards a big-top tent. We are...

               EXT. OLYMPIA CIRCUS - NIGHT

               ...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment 
               in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, 
               halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the 
               backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip 
               through Spectre.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I had just left Ashton, and was on 
                         my way to discover my destiny. Not 
                         knowing what that would be exactly, 
                         I explored every opportunity that 
                         presented itself.

               Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

               A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act 
               to tremendous APPLAUSE.

               As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster 
               AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be 
               four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.

                                     AMOS
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think 
                         you've seen the unusual. You may 
                         think you've seen the bizarre. But 
                         I've travelled to the five corners 
                         of the world, and let me tell you, 
                         I've never seen anything like this.

               From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards 
               the crowd.

                                     AMOS
                         When I found this man, he was picking 
                         oranges in Florida. His fellow workers 
                         called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- 
                         because when you were working beside 
                         him, he blocked out the daylight. He 
                         could take a whole tree in his hands 
                         and shake off the fruit. I had to 
                         pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I 
                         could take him with me.

               Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a 
               quieter moment.

                                     AMOS
                         Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this 
                         man wanted to, he could crush your 
                         head between his toes.
                              (she trembles)
                         But he won't.
                              (a long beat)
                         He's not going to hurt her, folks, 
                         because he's our own Gentle Giant. 
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                         Colossus!

               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL 
               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.

               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. 
               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. 
               Intrigued.

               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. 
               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is 
               COLOSSUS.

               From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he 
               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and 
               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.

               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus 
               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight 
               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.

               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with 
               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.

               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is 
               sitting on the dirt --

               KARL THE GIANT

               stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold 
               him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP 
               from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will 
               happen next?

               ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned 
               shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into 
               the shadows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT / LATER

               As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.

                                     AMOS
                         What's his name? Does he talk? It's 
                         not important.

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     AMOS
                         Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of 
                         the term "involuntary servitude?"

               Karl shakes his head.

                                     AMOS
                         "Unconscionable contract?"

               Nope.

                                     AMOS
                         Great, great. That's fantastic.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It was on that night Karl met his 
                         destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

               As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward 
               notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. 
               She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she 
               looks back at Edward.

               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.

               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A 
               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a 
               snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.

               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the 
               frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and 
               closer to this woman.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         They say when you meet the love of 
                         your life, time stops. And that's 
                         true. What they don't tell you, is 
                         that once time starts again, it moves 
                         extra fast to catch up.

               Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and 
               the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's 
               frozen, helpless in time.

               EXT. DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his 
               fated love. Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running 
               down the rows.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               THE EMPTY LOT

               Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops 
               and lets him climb in back.

               As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll 
               never find that girl, the love of his life.

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT

               Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He 
               spots Edward walking back into the tent.

                                     AMOS
                         Hey kid! Your friend just made himself 
                         a star.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great.

               Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.

                                     (INTRODUCING)
                         My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.

                                     EDWARD
                         Good to meet you.

               Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

                                     AMOS
                         What's the matter with you, kid? I 
                         haven't seen a customer so depressed 
                         since the elephant sat on that 
                         farmer's wife.
                              (beat)
                         Get it? "Depressed?"

               Karl chuckles.

                                     AMOS
                         See! The big guy likes it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I just saw the woman I'm going to 
                         marry, I know it. But then I lost 
                         her.

                                     AMOS
                         Tough break. Most men have to get 
                         married before they lose their wives.

                                     EDWARD
                              (with absolute 
                              conviction)
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life looking for her. That or die 
                         alone.

                                     AMOS
                         Jesus, kid.
                              (realizing)
                         Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde 
                         hair, blue hat?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes!

                                     AMOS
                         I know her uncle. Friends of the 
                         family.

                                     EDWARD
                         Who is she? Where does she live?

                                     AMOS
                         Kid. Don't waste your time. She's 
                         out of your league.

               As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with 
               him. Karl follows as well.

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you mean? You don't even 
                         know me.

                                     AMOS
                         Sure I do. You were hot shit back in 
                         Hickville, but here in the real world, 
                         you got squat. You don't have a plan. 
                         You don't have a job. You don't have 
                         anything but the clothes on your 
                         back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've got a whole backpack full of 
                         clothes!

               He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.

                                     EDWARD
                              (realizing)
                         Someone stole my backpack.

                                     AMOS
                         Kid, you were a big fish in a small 
                         pond. This here is the ocean, and 
                         you're drowning. Take my advice and 
                         go back to Puddleville. You'll be 
                         happy there.

               Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait. You said I don't have a plan. 
                         I do. I'm going to find that girl 
                         and marry her and spend the rest of 
                         my life with her.

               Amos smiles, amused.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't have a job, but I would have 
                         a job if you gave me one. And I may 
                         not have much, but I have more 
                         determination than any man you're 
                         ever going to meet.

                                     AMOS
                         Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll work night and day, and you 
                         won't have to pay me. You just have 
                         to tell me who she is.

               Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he 
               can say no. He shrugs. What the hell.

                                     AMOS
                         Every month you work for me, I'll 
                         tell you one thing about her. That's 
                         my final offer.

               Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. 
               We move into a MONTAGE:

               INT. BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to 
               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it 
               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are 
               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward 
               is dead.

               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes 
               Edward antsier.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I did everything 
                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of 
                         things he didn't. I'd go three days 
                         without stopping to eat, and four 
                         days without sleeping.

               EXT. THE HYDRA - DAY

               His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling 
               amusement park ride.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The only thing that kept me going 
                         was the promise of meeting the girl 
                         who would be my wife.

               Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the 
               spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the 
               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the 
               air.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, 
               falling in the mud.

               His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's 
               unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds. 
               To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges 
               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.

               He catches his breath, lucky.

               Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him 
               in the shoulder.

               EXT. BEHIND A TENT - DAY

               Karl the Giant bandages Edward's arm as well as he can. Amos 
               is walking past.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's been a month today.

               Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally...

                                     AMOS
                         This girl, the love of your life. 
                         Her favorite flower is daffodils.

               He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the 
               concept.

                                     EDWARD
                         Daffodils.
                              (to Karl)
                         Daffodils!

               INT. STABLES - DAY

               Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen. 
               But all he can think about is...

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Daffodils!

               The wonder of it. He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his 
               face.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         True to his word, every month Amos 
                         would tell me something new about 
                         the woman of my dreams.

               INT. A DARK PLACE - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest 
               bit of information.

                                     EDWARD
                         College! She's going to college!

               A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               ...out of a giant cannon.

               INT. STABLES - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Music! She likes music. I like music 
                         too!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the months, I learned a lot 
                         about the woman I was going to marry, 
                         but not her name, and not where to 
                         find her.

               That time had come. I couldn't wait any longer.

               EXT. AMOS CALLOWAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, 
               and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. 
               Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.

               But Edward KNOCKS anyway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I 
                         need to talk to you.

               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the 
               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.

               Edward turns the knob.

               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his 
               throat. 

               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but 
               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold 
               on tight.

               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES 
               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.

               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls 
               to his feet.

               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready 
               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming 
               the revolver at the dog.

               At the last moment...

                                     EDWARD
                         No, wait!

               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches 
               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

               The carnies GASP.

               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, 
               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of 
               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, 
               ready to strike it.

               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces 
               excitedly, ready to play fetch.

               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can. The dog bounds after it,

               SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.

               It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it 
               drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth.

                                     EDWARD
                         It was that night I discovered that 
                         most things you consider evil or 
                         wicked are simply lonely, and lacking 
                         in the social niceties.

               Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new 
               direction.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. FIELD - PRE-DAWN

               Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the 
               stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's 
               gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes 
               concerned.

               He follows it into the woods.

               INT. WOODS - DAWN

               Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. 
               He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as 
               Edward approaches.

                                     AMOS
                         Didn't kill anything, did I?

                                     EDWARD
                         A few rabbits, but I think one of 
                         them was already dead.

                                     AMOS
                         That would explain the indigestion.

               Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.

                                     AMOS
                         I was wrong about you kid. You may 
                         not have much, but what you got, you 
                         got a lot of. You could get any girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's only one I want.

               A beat.

                                     AMOS
                         Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's 
                         going to Auburn. The semester's almost 
                         over, so you better hurry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Thank you.

                                     AMOS
                         Good luck, kid.

               Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there 
               as soon as possible.

               Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.

               EXT. BIG TOP - DAY

               Edward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After saying my goodbyes, I hopped 
                         three trains to get to Auburn that 
                         afternoon.

               EXT. AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY

               We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking 
               his head in the fountain.

               He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out 
               of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative 
               dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-
               open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG 
               WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't 
               see.

               Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the 
               woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's 
               effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.

               He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, 
               nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't know me, but my name is 
                         Edward Bloom and I am in love with 
                         you. I've spent the last three years 
                         working to find out who you are. 
                         I've been shot and stabbed and 
                         trampled a few times, had my ribs 
                         broken twice, but it's all worth it 
                         to see you here, now, and to finally 
                         get to talk to you. Because I am 
                         destined to marry you. I knew that 
                         from the first moment I saw you at 
                         the circus. And I know it now more 
                         than ever.

               ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say 
               is...

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't need to apologize to me. I 
                         mean, I'm the luckiest person you're 
                         going to find today...

               She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, 
               we see a diamond.

                                     SANDRA
                         No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be 
                         married.

               ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress 
               the reaction, put on a brave front.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh.

                                     SANDRA
                         But you're wrong. I do know you, at 
                         least by reputation. Edward Bloom 
                         from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged 
                         to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He 
                         was a few years older than you.

                                                              FLASHCUTS TO:

               EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT

               Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward.

               VARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS 93

               Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball 
               highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time.

               THE STREET CORNER / ASHTON PARADE

               A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves 
               town.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT/INT. SORORITY HOUSE - THE DOORWAY

               Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster...

                                     EDWARD
                         Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to 
                         have bothered you.

               He turns and walks down the front steps.

               She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely 
               horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back 
               inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters 
               get to the bottom of this.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it. It's not funny. That poor 
                         boy.

               We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Fate has a cruel way of circling 
                         around on you. After all this work 
                         to leave Ashton, the girl I loved 
                         was now engaged to one of its biggest 
                         jerks.

               He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the 
               background.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There's a time when a man needs to 
                         fight, and a time when he needs to 
                         accept that his destiny is lost, 
                         that the ship has sailed, and that 
                         only a fool would continue.

               A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority 
               house.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I've always been a 
                         fool.

               We CIRCLE as he shouts:

                                     EDWARD
                         Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I 
                         am going to marry you!

               INT. SORORITY HOUSE FOYER - DAY

               Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains. Is 
               this guy crazy?

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation. 
               Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention.

               He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it. 
               There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice.

               A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up. Written on the 
               projector is "I Love Sandra Templeton." She's horrified and 
               excited at the same time. The professor finally notices what's 
               written there.

               EXT. QUAD - DAY

               Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving. 
               We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart 
               floats in the wind.

               INT. SANDRA'S BEDROOM - [THE NEXT] MORNING

               At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the 
               second-story window to find the lawn filled with

               TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.

               Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six 
               hours.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra walks out to him. She's smiling, confused, joyful and 
               scared. All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to 
               see the display.

                                     SANDRA
                         Daffodils?

                                     EDWARD
                         They're your favorite flower.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get so many?

                                     EDWARD
                         I called everywhere in five states 
                         and explained this was the only way 
                         I could get my wife to marry me.

               Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. She wipes 
               it off.

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't even know me.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have the rest of my life to find 
                         out.

               From down the street...

                                     A MAN'S VOICE
                         Sandra!

                                     SANDRA
                         It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt 
                         him.

                                     EDWARD
                         If that's what you want, I swear to 
                         it.

               The adult DON PRICE arrives. He's 230 pounds of football-
               playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle. And he's 
               pissed.

               A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Bloom!

                                     EDWARD
                         Don.

                                     DON PRICE
                         What the hell are you doing? This is 
                         my girl. Mine!

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't know she belonged to anybody.

               Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right 
               back up, but makes no move to defend himself.

               Unfazed, Don slugs him again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it!

                                     DON PRICE
                              (ignoring)
                         What the matter, Bloom? Too scared 
                         to fight back?

                                     EDWARD
                         I promised I wouldn't.

               A beat. Don shrugs, fine. Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass 
               nine ways to Sunday.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         While I took the beating of a 
                         lifetime, it was Don Price who was 
                         ultimately defeated.

               As the ass-whupping continues, we 

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [FLASHFORWARD]

               Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading 
               the new Playboy.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         All the physical activity had worsened 
                         a congenital valve defect. Put simply, 
                         his heart wasn't strong enough.

               Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. 
               Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on 
               the tile.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. WITCH'S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

               The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected 
               in The Eye.

                                                         RETURNING BACK TO:

               EXT. THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back 
               to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Don!

               Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.

               Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible 
               AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.

                                     SANDRA
                         I will never marry you.

               A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.

               Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting 
               for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?

                                     DON PRICE
                         What. You love this guy?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's almost a stranger and I prefer 
                         him to you. 

               She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. 
               But not before decking Edward one last time.

               Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the 
               daffodils.

                                     SANDRA
                         How can I convince you to stop?

                                     EDWARD
                         Go out with me.

               He smiles, his teeth bloody.

                                     SANDRA
                         Okay.

               As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP 
               above the flowered battlefield.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As it turned out, Sandra was able to 
                         keep her same date at the chapel. 
                         Only the groom had changed.

               As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT]

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I thought you said you didn't have a 
                         church wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, we were all set to, but there 
                         was a complication.

               He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has 
               it for him. She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire 
               glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the 
               stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Is it the medicine that's making you 
                         thirsty?

                                     EDWARD (O.S.)
                         Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole 
                         life. Never really known why.

               Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but 
               not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few 
               inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

               INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM

                                     EDWARD
                         There was one time when I was 
                         eleven...

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (gently)
                         You were talking about your wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't forget. I was just working 
                         on a tangent. See, most men, they'll 
                         tell a story straight through, and 
                         it won't be complicated, but it won't 
                         be interesting either.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I like your stories.

                                     EDWARD
                         And I like you.

               He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. 
               There's a story to be told.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now. The thing about working for a 
                         circus is you don't have a regular 
                         address, and after three years I had 
                         a lot of undelivered mail.

               In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself 
               listen to the story one more time.

                                     EDWARD
                         During the four weeks I was in the 
                         hospital, the postmaster finally 
                         caught up with me.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail 
               with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking 
               letter. Reading it, his face drops.

               FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out that while my heart 
                         belonged to Sandra, the rest of my 
                         body belonged to the U.S. Government.

               INT. ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT

               With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a 
               dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, 
               but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A hitch in the Army was up to three 
                         years at that point, and having waited 
                         three years just to meet Sandra, I 
                         knew I couldn't survive being away 
                         from her that long. So I took every 
                         hazardous assignment I could find, 
                         with the hope of getting my time 
                         down to less than a year.

               The JUMP LEADER yells...

                                     JUMP LEADER
                         GO! GO! GO!

               One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main 
               line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...

               ...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.

               He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking 
               down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the 
               darkness. They're already long gone.

               Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting 
               through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the 
               plane.

               EXT. OUTSIDE STAGE - NIGHT

               A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the 
               equivalent of a U.S.O. show.

               A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. 
               We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every 
               act is fundamentally the same.

               The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's 
               finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. 
               The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of 
               the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

               EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT

               We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. 
               He can't steer. He's helpless.

               But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. 
               The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough 
               cover for Edward to remain unseen.

               He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. 
               He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the 
               curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited 
               soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless 
               cricket left on the anthill.

               EXT. ON STAGE

               The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's 
               as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.

               She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a 
               knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their 
               feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.

               UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. 
               The two men begin to SCUFFLE.

               MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an 
               off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

                                     PING
                         Sometimes a girl can feel so alone 
                         Without a lover to call her own. 
                         Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to 
                         explode. 
                         Wants to grab the first man she sees 
                         and tear off his clothes.

               A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.

               Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of 
               the catwalk, sliding down it to end up

               BACKSTAGE.

               His determined opponent follows him down.

                                     PING (CONT'D)
                         But she won't.
                         No, she can't. 
                         She needs a special special different 
                         unusual man. 
                         Because that girl, 
                         Who looks like me, 
                         She has wants, but she has needs.

                                     PING
                              (speaking)
                         Any of you got needs?

               The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.

               Backstage, the two men are still fighting.

                                     PING
                              (chorus)
                         I've had twice the adventure, 
                         Cried double the tears. 
                         Two times the bad times in half the 
                         years. 
                         I need a strong man, because I've 
                         got 
                         Twice the love to give.

               For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was 
               standing in profile. Ping is one-half of

               SIAMESE TWINS.

               Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all 
               this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, 
               one set of perfect legs beneath them.

               Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It 
               costs him a punch to the jaw.

                                     PING
                         Say hello, Jing.

                                     JING
                         Hello Jing.

                                     PING
                              (to the crowd)
                         I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good 
                         one.
                              (closer)
                         I'm the bad one.

               As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the 
               fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.

               As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final 
               pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, 
               their backs forming the curves.

               Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.

               The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. 
               The curtain slowly lowers, revealing

               EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.

               The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee 
               yells for the Guards to search.

               ON STAGE

               Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her 
               cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and 
               Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, 
               they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities 
               become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, 
               while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.

               In Chinese, subtitled...

                                     PING
                         How could you miss your cue? You 
                         make me look like a fool, out there 
                         alone.

                                     JING
                         You weren't alone.

               Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.

               Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, 
               exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to 
               look.

                                     PING
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     EDWARD
                              (in Chinese)
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

                                     PING
                         Damn right you're not.
                              (yelling)
                         GUARD!

               Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A 
               rifle-toting GUARD looks in.

               Pretending to be her bitchy sister --

                                     JING
                         Tell your men not to bother us! And 
                         lock that door!

               The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Desperately 
               flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds...

                                     EDWARD
                         Please, I need your help.

                                     PING
                         What makes you think we'll help you?

               Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. It's Sandra.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               VARIOUS SHOTS

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the next hour, I described my 
                         love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and 
                         the ordeal that brought me before 
                         them. As it had always been, this 
                         love was my salvation. It was destined 
                         to be.

               Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear. Even Ping is a 
               little affected.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         We put together an elaborate plan 
                         for escape, involving a whaling ship 
                         to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a 
                         small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all 
                         knew it would be dangerous.

               Still subtitled:

                                     PING
                         And what are we supposed to do when 
                         we get to America?

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get you bookings. I know the 
                         biggest man in show business.

                                     JING
                         Bob Hope?

                                     EDWARD
                         Bigger.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so the twins and I began our 
                         arduous journey halfway around the 
                         world. Unfortunately, there was no 
                         way to send a message back to America.

               A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so it was no surprise that the 
                         Army believed I was dead.

               Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout 
               makes church bells RING.

               EXT. BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a 
               tunnel of fabric.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After four months, Sandra had gotten 
                         over the worst of the nightmares. 
                         When the phone rang, she didn't think 
                         it was somehow me calling her. When 
                         a car drove past, she didn't get up 
                         to check out the window.

               Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see

               A MAN'S SILHOUETTE

               on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow 
               ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the 
               breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.

               She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she 
               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.

               Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing 
               before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. 
               It is destiny.

               Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

               filters through soft sheets. We're under the covers, where a 
               man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, 
               then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be

               JOSEPHINE.

               She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. 
               He's been up for a while. We are actually...

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               ...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind 
               of limbo. A kiss good morning. Legs entangling. Neither wants 
               to get up.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I talked with your father last night.

                                     WILL
                         Did you?

               A look to say, should I be worried?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You never told me how your parents 
                         met.

                                     WILL
                         They met at Auburn.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What about the details? How they 
                         fell in love. The Circus. The War. 
                         You never told me any of that.

                                     WILL
                         That's because most of it never 
                         happened.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's romantic.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                              (non-committal)
                         Mmm.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Mmm, what?

                                     WILL
                         Mmm, what. I know better than to 
                         argue romance with a French woman.

               He moves his head out from under the sheet. She follows him 
               to the "outside."

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Do you love your father?

                                     WILL
                         Everyone loves my father. He's a 
                         very likeable guy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (repeating)
                         Do you love him?

               Will doesn't want to answer yes or no.

                                     WILL
                         You have to understand. When I was 
                         growing up, he was gone more than he 
                         was here. And I started thinking -- 
                         maybe he has a second life somewhere 
                         else. With another house, another 
                         family. He leaves us, he goes to 
                         them. Or maybe there is no family. 
                         Maybe he never wanted a family. But 
                         whatever it is, maybe he likes that 
                         second life better. And the reason 
                         he tells all those stories is because 
                         he can't stand this boring place.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's not true.

                                     WILL
                         What is "true?" I've never heard my 
                         father say a single true thing.

               Off her silence...

                                     WILL
                         Look, I know why you like him. I 
                         know why everyone likes him. But I 
                         need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You're not.

                                     WILL
                         I need you on my side.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I am always on your side. And I think 
                         you should talk to him.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up 
               around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better. 
               Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his 
               expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry.

               He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I ever tell you about how...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes.

               Edward is startled.

                                     WILL
                         The maple tree and the Buick. We 
                         heard it.

                                     EDWARD
                              (re: Josephine)
                         I think someone hasn't.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         The tree fell on the car, spilling 
                         the syrup, which attracted the flies, 
                         which got stuck to it and flew off 
                         with the whole car.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                              (undeterred)
                         But the real story is how I got the 
                         car. You see...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Son?

                                     WILL
                         Can we talk?

               Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to get started on dishes.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'll help you.

               Both women quickly gather plates.

               Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to 
               happen. It settles for a beat after they leave.

                                     WILL
                         Do you know much about icebergs, 
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They 
                         were hauling it down to Texas for 
                         drinking water, only they didn't 
                         count on an elephant being frozen 
                         inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad!

                                     EDWARD
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

                                     EDWARD
                         Then you shouldn't have started with 
                         a question. Because people want to 
                         answer questions. You should have 
                         started with, "The thing about 
                         icebergs is..."

                                     WILL
                              (frustrated)
                         The thing about icebergs is you only 
                         see 10 percent of them. The other 90 
                         percent is below the water where you 
                         can't see it. And that's what it is 
                         with you Dad. I'm only seeing this 
                         little bit that sticks above the 
                         water.

                                     EDWARD
                              (joking)
                         What, you're seeing down to my nose? 
                         My chin?

                                     WILL
                         I have no idea who you are because 
                         you have never told me a single fact.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've told you a thousand facts. That's 
                         all I do, Will. I tell stories.

                                     WILL
                         You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing 
                         lies. Stories are what you tell a 
                         five-year old at bedtime. They're 
                         not elaborate mythologies you maintain 
                         when your son is ten and fifteen and 
                         twenty and thirty. And the thing is, 
                         I believed you. I believed your 
                         stories so much longer than I should 
                         have. And then when I realized that 
                         everything you said was impossible -- 
                         everything! -- I felt like such a 
                         fool to have trusted you. You were 
                         like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny 
                         combined. Just as charming and just 
                         as fake.

                                     EDWARD
                         You think I'm fake.

                                     WILL
                         Only on the surface. But that's all 
                         I've ever seen.

               Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my 
                         own here. It would kill me if he 
                         went through his whole life never 
                         understanding me.

                                     EDWARD
                         It would kill you, huh?

               Finally --

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you want, Will? Who do you 
                         want me to be?

                                     WILL
                         Yourself. Good, bad, everything. 
                         Just show me who you are for once.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have been nothing but myself since 
                         the day I was born. And if you can't 
                         see that, it's your failing, not 
                         mine.

               EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

               With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out 
               of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long 
               since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, 
               slime covering the cemented rocks.

               Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's 
               surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which 
               disappears into the murky water.

               A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He 
               casually walks away.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring 
               into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of 
               hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built 
               outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian 
               lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to 
               sell.

               Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its 
               ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit 
               beside it.

                                     SANDRA
                         Your father decided he needed to 
                         have an office, and it wouldn't do 
                         to have it in the house. You'll know 
                         better than me what's important.

               With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a 
               neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to 
               being startled.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]

               Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash 
               bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, 
               Sandra makes a small sound. A memory.

                                     WILL
                         What is it?

               Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with 
               Josephine.

                                     SANDRA
                         It was during the war. Your father 
                         went missing. They thought he was 
                         dead.

               Will can't believe what he's reading.

                                     WILL
                         That really happened?

                                     SANDRA
                         Not everything your father says is a 
                         complete fabrication.

               A beat, then Sandra stands.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to check on him.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I need to lie down for a bit.

                                     WILL
                         Go.

               Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the 
               telegram, still bewildered.

               Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange 
               mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.

               Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device 
               in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the 
               hand.

               Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After the war, the sons of Alabama 
                         returned home, looking for work. 
                         Each had an advantage over me. They 
                         were alive, while I was -- officially -- 
                         deceased.

               INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE - DAY [STORY]

               Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN. The 
               company is called "Confederated Products." The OFFICE LADIES 
               all love Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         With my prospects few, I took a job 
                         as a travelling salesman. It suited 
                         me. If there's one thing you can say 
                         about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a 
                         social person.

               EXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY [STORY]

               On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to 
               the crowd.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've travelled from Tennessee to 
                         Timbuktu, and if there's one thing 
                         people have in common, is we could 
                         all use a hand around the house.

               Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a 
               metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five 
               fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)

                                     EDWARD
                         Why, with this product you can...

               QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

                                     EDWARD
                         Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch 
                         yourself while wearing mittens. Hold 
                         a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog 
                         away from kittens. It's strong enough, 
                         you can do a handstand with no hands 
                         at all.

               Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his 
               entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can use it to point out important 
                         information. Or dangers. Or beautiful 
                         women.

               The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.

                                     EDWARD
                         We're still working on that one.

               The crowd LAUGHS.

               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Soon I added other products, and 
                         other cities, until my territory 
                         stretched from the coast to western 
                         Texas.

               EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

               Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as 
               ever.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I could be gone for weeks at a time. 
                         But every other Friday, I'd put all 
                         the money I'd made into an account 
                         set aside for a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               EXT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               Establishing this Texas institution, we come...

               INT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd. Taking his place 
               in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.

               As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front 
               of him gets a look at Edward.

                                     THE MAN
                         Edward? Edward Bloom?

               The man is none other than...

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         It's me. Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was astonished to see the greatest 
                         poet of both Ashton and Spectre all 
                         the way out in Texas.

               The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't believe it!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I want you to know, when you left 
                         Spectre it opened my eyes. There was 
                         a whole life out there that I was 
                         not living. So I travelled. I saw 
                         France, and Africa, half of South 
                         America. Every day a new adventure, 
                         that's my motto.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great, Norther. I'm happy for 
                         you. I can't believe I helped.

               He's genuinely proud.

                                     EDWARD
                         So what are you up to now?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I'm robbing this place.

               Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols 
               out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

               SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a 
               halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. 
               The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to Edward)
                         Would you mind grabbing that?

               There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might 
               as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it 
               would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to the crowd)
                         Now, I want all of you to lie down. 
                         I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash 
                         drawers, and my associate here is 
                         going to handle the vault. 
                              (pointing to a Teller 
                              Woman)
                         You help my friend, okay?

               The TELLER WOMAN nods.

               ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he 
               truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is 
               already waving him to the back.

               He decides he better go.

               INT. AT THE VAULT - DAY

               The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. 
               Edward feels horrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't 
                         want anybody to get hurt.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         It's not that, it's just...

               She pulls open the vault door.

               INT. THE VAULT - DAY

               The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds 
               exactly one folding chair. Nothing else.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         ...there's no money. We're completely 
                         bankrupt.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out the savings and loan 
                         had already been robbed -- not by 
                         armed bandits, but by speculators in 
                         Texas real estate.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                              (dead serious)
                         You gotta promise you won't tell 
                         anybody.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DAY

               Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're 
               going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following 
               them. It's an empty country road for miles.

               Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars! 
                         Not bad for just the drawers. Let's 
                         see what you got from the vault.

               Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through 
               the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single 
               deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little 
               cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is it? The whole vault.

                                     EDWARD
                         'Fraid so.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, it's got your deposit slip 
                         on it.

               Caught, Edward has to confess...

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I just didn't want you to go 
                         empty-handed. There's something you 
                         should know, Norther. You see, the 
                         reason why...

               Edward continues his narration...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I told Norther about the vagaries of 
                         Texas oil money and its effect on 
                         real estate prices, and how lax 
                         enforcement of fiduciary process had 
                         made savings and loans particularly 
                         vulnerable.

               Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

               EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY

               Norther leans in the driver's side window.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I should go to Wall Street. That's 
                         where all the money is.

               Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I knew then that while my days as a 
                         criminal were over, Norther's were 
                         just beginning.

               The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the 
               last moment, Norther calls out:

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, thank you for the hand!

               He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON 
               Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         When Norther made his first million 
                         dollars, he sent me a check for ten 
                         thousand. I protested, but he said 
                         it was my fee as his career advisor.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE '70'S] - DAY

               Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to 
               greet Edward, just returned from another trip.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Ten thousand dollars is no fortune 
                         to most men. But it was enough to 
                         buy my wife a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. 
               Edward kisses his wife.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And for that, it was all the riches 
                         a man could ever want.

               Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [PRESENT]

               CLOSE ON Edward's hand as he turns knobs.

               CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which 
               begins to fill.

               Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub. 
               Carefully lowers himself.

               As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, 
               Edward suddenly slides

               UNDERWATER.

               Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's 
               quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the 
               spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.

               A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent. 
               Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find

               SANDRA

               sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly 
               worried -- her husband has always done this.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was drying out.

                                     SANDRA
                         I see. We need to get you one of 
                         those plant misters. We can spray 
                         you like a fern.

               He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in 
               the tub. A beat while she considers.

               Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, 
               facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.

               He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has 
               tears hanging in her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Come now.

               He wipes them away.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't think I'll ever dry out.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another 
               file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but 
               usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.

               He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. 
               Something doesn't make sense.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE / STAIRS - DAY

               Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the 
               corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress.

                                     WILL
                         Is he awake?

                                     SANDRA
                         He just fell asleep. Josephine's 
                         with him.

               She passes him. He turns.

                                     WILL
                         Mom?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes?

               Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...

                                     WILL
                         Did you and Dad have any other 
                         property?

                                     SANDRA
                              (thinking)
                         I suppose your grandmother's house 
                         when she passed on. But we sold that 
                         right away. Your cousin Shirley bought 
                         it.

                                     WILL
                         So you never bought any land.

                                     SANDRA
                         Heavens no. We had a hard enough 
                         time keeping the mortgage on this 
                         place.

               Will nods, just curious. He continues heading up.

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               Will changes his shirt. Takes his keys off the nightstand.

               EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY

               Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10 
               miles."

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will checks the address on one of his father's files.

               EXT. ASHTON GAS - DAY

               Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, 
               then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And 
               then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre!"

               EXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels 
               lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through 
               the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.

               As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He 
               checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded 
               by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. 
               Will notices this.

               Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly.

               Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS. 
               The piano stops.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go back to the start. Right hand 
                         only.

               The piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS.

               The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the 
               woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill.

               She and Will are startled to see each other.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh. Oh.

                                     WILL
                         Hello.

                                     JENNY
                         I wasn't expecting you.

               Confused, Will checks the name on the form.

                                     WILL
                         Are you Jenny Hill?

                                     JENNY
                         I am. And you're Will. I've seen 
                         your picture, that's how I recognize 
                         you. I almost said something at the 
                         store, but it would have been awkward.
                              (a beat)
                         Like this.

               The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's 
               watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward...

                                     JENNY
                              (to the student)
                         Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the 
                         lesson today? We can go again next 
                         week.

               She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.

                                     STUDENT
                         Do I have to give it back to my Mom?

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell her if you won't.

               You don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a 
               flash.

               INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY

               While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she 
               never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will.

                                     WILL
                         How did you know my father?

                                     JENNY
                         This was on his sales route, so he 
                         was through here all the time. 
                         Everyone in town knew him.

               A beat. Not flinching...

                                     WILL
                         Were you and my father having an 
                         affair?

                                     JENNY
                              (taken aback)
                         Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was 
                         expecting to dance around this for 
                         another half hour.

                                     WILL
                         I've seen him with women. He flirts. 
                         He always has. On some level, I 
                         presumed he was cheating on my mother. 
                         I just never had proof.

               She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her 
               into. Once she's finally free...

                                     JENNY
                         Can I ask you a question? Why did 
                         you come here today? If you found 
                         this deed, why didn't you just ask 
                         Eddie?

                                     WILL
                         Because he's dying.

               A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. 
               She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.

                                     JENNY
                         Look, I don't know how much you want 
                         to know about any of this. You have 
                         one image of your father and it would 
                         be wrong for me to go and change it. 
                         Especially this late in the game.

                                     WILL
                         My father talked about a lot of things 
                         he never did, and I'm sure he did a 
                         lot of things he never talked about. 
                         I'm just trying to reconcile the 
                         two.

               Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

                                     JENNY
                         The first thing you have to 
                         understand, is that your father never 
                         meant to end up here. And yet he 
                         did, twice. The first time, he was 
                         early. The second time, he was late.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

               It's late, and Edward is pensive.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Those days, your father was working 
                         for himself. If there was one thing 
                         you could say about Edward Bloom, 
                         it's that he was a social person, 
                         and people took a liking to him. One 
                         night he was returning from three 
                         weeks on the road, when he hit a 
                         thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

               The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the 
               wipers.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]

               Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- 
               there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught 
               in a waterfall. It's that loud.

               No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just 
               as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but 
               softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --

               EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

               -- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, 
               but where there used to be air is water.

               Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.

               INT. THE CAR - NIGHT

               Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is 
               trickling in through the crack between the window and the 
               door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.

               That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.

               She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face 
               exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, 
               as the first time we saw her.

               She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet 
               hers. And smiles.

                                                              FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY

               It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees 
               drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.

               Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his 
               suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from

               HIS CAR,

               which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As 
               Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny 
               piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, 
               rubs it off.

               It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Fate has a way of circling back on a 
                         man, and taking him by surprise.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a 
               one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...

                                  "Welcome to Spectre."

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the 
               road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to 
               find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, 
               along with the rest of the town's.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A man sees things differently at 
                         different times in his life. This 
                         town didn't seem the same now that 
                         he was older.

               EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are 
               "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A new road had brought the outside 
                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, 
                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere 
                         you looked, people were bankrupt.

               EXT. SPECTRE - DAY

               We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward 
               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among 
               the bidders.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Two different corporations were 
                         looking at buying the town, if they 
                         could get the price low enough. One 
                         wanted to open a chicken processing 
                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. 
                         Either way, Spectre would be 
                         destroyed.

               Edward raises his hand.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fifty-thousand!

               Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And so Edward Bloom decided to buy 
                         the town, in order to save it.

               INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAY

               Edward pitches his plan to Norther.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         He was never a wealthy man, but he 
                         had made other men rich, and now he 
                         asked for their favors.

               INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward 
               talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most of them had never seen Spectre -- 
                         they only had Edward's words to 
                         describe it. That's all they needed. 
                         He sold them on the dream.

                                     JING
                         You can structure it as a historical 
                         trust. But you'll need every 
                         contiguous piece of property. It's 
                         all or nothing.

               As Edward takes notes...

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         So first he bought the farms. Then 
                         he bought the houses. Then he bought 
                         the stores.

               INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY

               Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Whatever he bought, the people were 
                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything. They were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing. In 
                         that way, he could make sure the 
                         town would never die.

               EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY

               Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally 
               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the 
               trees' thick canopy.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Within six months, his trust had 
                         purchased the entire town. With one 
                         exception.

               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. 
               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around 
               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS 
               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire 
               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.

               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. 
               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...

                                     JENNY
                         You must be Edward Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         How did you know?

               She keeps PLAYING.

                                     JENNY
                         No one would come out here unless 
                         they had business. And no one would 
                         have business with me except for 
                         you. You're buying the town.

                                     EDWARD
                         Apparently I've overlooked this one 
                         piece of it, and I'd like to remedy 
                         that. You see, in order for the town 
                         to be preserved, the trust must own 
                         it in its entirety.

                                     JENNY
                         So I've heard.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll offer you more than it's worth. 
                         And you know you won't have to move. 
                         Nothing will change except the name 
                         on the deed, you have my word.

               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns 
               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.

                                     JENNY
                         Now let me get this straight. You'll 
                         buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay 
                         in it. You'll own the house, but 
                         it'll still be mine. I'll be here, 
                         and you'll come and go as you please 
                         to one place or another. Do I have 
                         that right?

               Strange to hear it put that way, but --

                                     EDWARD
                         In so many words, yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If 
                         nothing is going to change, I'd just 
                         as soon it not change in the way it 
                         hasn't been changing all this time.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's not like you're going to lose 
                         anything. You can ask anyone in town. 
                         I've been nothing if not generous. I 
                         want the best for everyone.

               A long beat.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this 
                         land? Some sort of midlife crisis? 
                         Instead of buying a convertible, you 
                         buy a town?

               He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really 
               asked before.

                                     EDWARD
                         Helping people makes me happy.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not convinced you should be happy.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry. Have I offended you?

               She finally turns to face him.

                                     JENNY
                         No, you did exactly what you promised. 
                         You came back. I was just expecting 
                         you sooner.

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

               EXT. SPECTRE - NIGHT

               Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for 
               the first time.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               Finally realizing who this woman is...

                                     EDWARD
                         You're Beamen's daughter. Your last 
                         name is different.
                              (realizing)
                         You married.

                                     JENNY
                         I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that 
                         was a big difference.

               Before he can say anything more...

                                     JENNY
                         I won't be selling you this house, 
                         Mr. Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         I see. I thank you for your time.

               A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.

               EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY

               Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it 
               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for.

               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they 
               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry.

               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps 
               slipping.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay, just leave it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get it. I can just...

               He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then 
               falls in, SMASHING a small table.

                                     EDWARD
                         Lord, I'm sorry I...

                                     JENNY
                         Please. Go. Just go.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll...

                                     JENNY
                         Go.

               She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he 
               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.

               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's 
               something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on. 
                         But Edward was not like most men.

               EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door 
               from a pickup truck.

               EXT. SHACK - DAY

               While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries 
               to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the 
               house until it fits.

               INT. SHACK - ANOTHER DAY

               Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows 
               himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's 
               telling.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As the months passed, he found more 
                         and more things to fix, until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself.

               EXT. SWAMP - ANOTHER DAY

               Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.

               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to 
               see the shack is now

               THE LOVELY HOUSE

               we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and 
               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is 
               impossibly charming.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. 
               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. 
               And watching him with deepest affection.

                                     EDWARD
                         Of course, the best part was creating 
                         new material. By the time the twins 
                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them, 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.

               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer.

                                     EDWARD
                         I suppose I should...

               He takes his hat off the rack.

                                     JENNY
                         You can leave it there.

               A beat. Does she really mean it?

               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his 
               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- 
               just a half-inch from kissing him when --

               -- Edward gently holds her back.

                                     EDWARD
                         No.

               She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should 
                         never have let you think that...
                              (beat)
                         I am in love with my wife.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

                                     EDWARD
                         And from the moment I saw her until 
                         the moment I die, she's the only 
                         one.

                                     JENNY
                         Lucky girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

               With that, he begins to leaves.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait! Edward!

               She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house. 
               Hands it to him. With a look, he thanks her. Then goes.

               EXT. SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR

               Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         One day, Edward Bloom left, and never 
                         returned to the town he'd saved.

               He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

               EXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT

               As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, 
               swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.

               Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes 
               slither through the marsh.

               Day becomes night.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As for the girl, the common belief 
                         was that she'd become a witch, and 
                         crazy at that. She became something 
                         of a legend herself.

               We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty 
               iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And the story ended where it began.

               INT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

               Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of 
               iced tea between them.

                                     WILL
                         Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, 
                         because she was old back when he was 
                         young.

                                     JENNY
                         No, it's logical if you think like 
                         your father. See, to him, there's 
                         only two women: your mother and 
                         everyone else.

                                     WILL
                         You didn't become crazy.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, therapy. And one day I realized 
                         I was in love with a man who could 
                         never love me back. I was living in 
                         a fairy tale.

               Will smiles to hear it called that.

                                     JENNY
                         People aren't like they are in 
                         stories. They hurt each other without 
                         meaning to. They are kind and 
                         unbelievably cruel at the same moment. 
                         Like me, now. I'm not sure I should 
                         have told you any of this.

               Her composure is starting to break.

                                     WILL
                         No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I 
                         know.

               A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working 
               herself into more of a state by not talking.

                                     JENNY
                         I wanted to meet you for the longest 
                         time. I did.
                              (a smile)
                         I envied you so much. The way Eddie 
                         would talk about you when you were 
                         at Missouri, that award you won. 
                         Congratulations, incidentally. And 
                         when you got the job at the A.P., 
                         everything, he was so proud of you. 
                         I mean, that's the thing. Every moment 
                         he loved you.

               She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over 
               this.

                                     JENNY
                         And as brightly as the sun would 
                         shine when he was with me, every 
                         time he left it disappeared. I wanted 
                         to be as important to him as you 
                         were, and I was never going to be. I 
                         was make-believe and his other life, 
                         you, were real.

               ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

                                     JENNY
                         You knew that, didn't you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately 
               turns it off. He's trying to think.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK

               Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to 
               his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK

               It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV. 
               Will sets his keys on the table.

               INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

               Will looks in. Empty.

                                     WILL
                              (calling out)
                         Hello? Mom? Dad?

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK

               We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He 
               aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK

               Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. 
               The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.

               A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down 
               the stairs.

               INT. FOYER - DUSK

               Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, 
               where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.

               INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick 
               plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the 
               information desk, so Will forges ahead.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place 
               to start. Then, behind him --

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Will!

               He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She 
               was calling him.

                                     WILL
                         What happened?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Your father had a stroke. He's 
                         upstairs with your mom and Dr. 
                         Bennett.

                                     WILL
                         Is he going to be okay?

               A beat. How can she answer?

               He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of 
               course his father's not going to be okay.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, will he get back to 
                         the way he was when...

               She cuts him off --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No. He won't. I'm sorry.

               And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the 
               news.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. 
               There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's 
               mercifully quiet.

               Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself 
               together, but it's been a tough day.

               Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third 
               time.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't suppose one of us could stay 
                         with him. In case he...
                              (beat)
                         In case he wakes up, one of us should 
                         be there.

                                     WILL
                         I'll stay. Why don't you go home 
                         with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Dr. Bennett)
                         That's okay?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's fine.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Will)
                         You'll call if...

                                     WILL
                         I will. I'll call.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, do you want some time with Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes. Thank you.

               A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine 
               as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.

               She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his 
               fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a 
               study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable 
               but refusing to surrender to it.

               Josephine emerges.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm sorry. It seems every hour I 
                         have to...

                                     SANDRA
                         I know. It was the same when I was 
                         carrying Will. Like clockwork.

               The two women start to walk, no hurry.

                                     SANDRA
                         Do you like it, being pregnant?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I do.

                                     SANDRA
                         I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but 
                         I loved every minute of it. I did. 
                         Eddie was travelling a lot, so he 
                         was gone, but I felt like I always 
                         had a piece of him with me. A little 
                         part of his soul inside me. I could 
                         feel it. It was alive and kicking.

               Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She 
               struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...

                                     SANDRA
                         I really miss that.

               With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Don't stop. Don't.

               A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The 
               two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment 
               be.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the 
               crossword puzzle. A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his 
               overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Glad to see you're not trying to 
                         have a heartfelt talk. It's one of 
                         my greatest annoyances, when people 
                         talk to those who can't hear them.

                                     WILL
                         My father and I have an advantage. 
                         We never talk.

               Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.

                                     WILL
                         How long have you known my father?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Thirty years. Maybe more.

                                     WILL
                         How would you describe him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                              (re: chart)
                         Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated 
                         hypertension.
                              (beat)
                         How would his son describe him?

               Tables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have 
               one.

               Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Did your father ever tell you about 
                         the day you were born?

                                     WILL
                         A thousand times. He caught an 
                         uncatchable fish.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not that one. The real story. Did he 
                         ever tell you that?

                                     WILL
                              (suddenly interested)
                         No.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Your mother came in about three in 
                         the afternoon. Her neighbor drove 
                         her, on account of your father was 
                         on business in Wichita. You were 
                         born a week early, but there were no 
                         complications. It was a perfect 
                         delivery. Now, your father was sorry 
                         to miss it, but it wasn't the custom 
                         for the men to be in the room for 
                         deliveries then, so I can't see as 
                         it would have been much different 
                         had he been there. And that's the 
                         real story of how you were born.

               A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors 
               being paged.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not very exciting, is it? And I 
                         suppose if I had to choose between 
                         the true version and an elaborate 
                         one involving a fish and a wedding 
                         ring, I might choose the fancy 
                         version. But that's just me.

               Will half-smiles.

               Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will 
               and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and 
               starts making a list.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS

               Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.

               He smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he 
               looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

               It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is 
               glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, 
               Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, 
               the pen in his hand.

               He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What 
               woke him up?

               He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes 
               are open, scared and confused.

                                     WILL
                         Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?

               Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his 
               finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push 
               it.

                                     WILL
                         What can I do? Can I help? Can I get 
                         you something? Water?

               Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the 
               nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward 
               won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         The river.

                                     WILL
                         The river?

               It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. 
               It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this 
               world.

                                     EDWARD
                         Tell me how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         How what happens?

                                     EDWARD
                         How I go.

               ON WILL, realizing...

                                     WILL
                         You mean what you saw in The Eye?

               Edward nods. Yes, that's what he was trying to say.

               A long beat.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know that story, Dad. You 
                         never told me that one.

               Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and 
               holds it. There's nothing else to do.

               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He 
               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's 
               coming. Without the story, he's lost.

               Fighting the urge to panic --

                                     WILL
                         I can try, Dad. If you help. Just 
                         tell me how it starts.

                                     EDWARD
                         Like this.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. Okay.

               Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks 
               to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it.

               ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. It's morning, and you and I 
                         are in the hospital. I'd fallen asleep 
                         in the chair. I wake up and I see 
                         you, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [STORY VERSION]

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               It's dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the 
               vertical blinds.

                                     WILL
                              (louder and concerned)
                         Dad?

               We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, 
               combing his hair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Let's get out of here.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Somehow, you're better. Different. 
                         You're getting ready to go. And I 
                         say...

                                     WILL
                         Dad, you're in no condition to...

               But Edward throws back the covers.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a fold-up wheelchair in the 
                         bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me. 
                         As soon as we get off this floor, 
                         we'll be in the clear.

               Will heads for the bathroom. Sure enough, the wheelchair is 
               there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hurry! We don't have much time.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward 
               points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Faster!

               They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.

               Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will! I... What are you doing?

               Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair 
               himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with 
               him.

               The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.

                                     NURSE
                         Security! Stop them!

               DOWN THE HALL

               At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will 
               and Edward barreling straight at them.

                                     EDWARD
                         No time to explain! Follow us!

               Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking 
               Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

               INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

               Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly 
               crashes into the back wall as the doors close.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the 
               Chevrolet.

               AT THE CAR

               Will lifts his father out of the chair.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         I pick you up and you hardly weigh 
                         anything. I can't explain it.

               Will sets him in the passenger seat.

                                     EDWARD
                         Water. I need water.

               Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead. Hands 
               it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, 
               he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.

               Will pops the trunk. Starts to fold up the wheelchair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Leave it! We won't need it.

               TIRES SMOKE as the car peals out.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [REALITY]

               TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.

                                     WILL
                         And we have to take Glenville to 
                         avoid all the church traffic, because 
                         those damn church people drive too 
                         slow.

               TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail. He's focused completely 
               on Will's story.

                                     WILL
                         I ask...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT. GLENVILLE BLVD. - DAY [STORY VERSION]

               The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic.

                                     WILL (O.S.)
                         Where are we headed?

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         You say...

               INT. CHEVY - DAY

                                     EDWARD
                         The River!

               Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to 
               get around the jam. But it's no use.

               Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive 
               hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

               Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.

               EXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY

               The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of 
               more than 100 waiting.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         As we get closer to the river, we 
                         see everybody's already there. And I 
                         mean everybody.

               Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. 
               Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the 
               Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a 
               day since we saw them last.

               While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, 
               Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.

                                     PING
                         He's here!

               The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill 
               smiles. So does the Old Woman.

               We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...

               YOUNG EDWARD

               reflected. This is what he saw.

               INT. THE CHEVROLET - DAY

               Amazed, Will turns to his father.

                                     WILL
                         It's unbelievable.

                                     EDWARD
                         Story of my life.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. 
               Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl 
               comes just after that.

               Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. 
               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.

               Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He 
               hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. 
               They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

               The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As 
               he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the 
               cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And the strange thing is, there's 
                         not a sad face to be found. Everyone's 
                         just so glad to see you, and send 
                         you off right.

               Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so 
               his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!

                                     THE CROWD (VARIOUS)
                         Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll 
                         miss you!

               But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns 
               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.

               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an 
               unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than 
               we've ever seen her.

                                     EDWARD
                         My girl in the river.

               She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in 
               approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only 
               Will is there to witness.

               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. 
               But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free 
               with his teeth.

               A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the 
               ring out of his mouth.

               Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For 
               he's no longer a man, but rather

               A FAT CATFISH

               swimming at his feet.

               We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, 
               disappearing.

               Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching 
               Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back 
               on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

               MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

               Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, 
               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives 
               back under with a SPLASH.

                                                         CROSSFADE BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.

                                     WILL
                         You become what you always were. A 
                         very big fish.
                              (he smiles)
                         And that's the way it happens.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a whisper)
                         Yes. Exactly.

               Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale 
               and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of 
               his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.

               And this is how he goes.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The 
               walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.

               He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see 
               through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing. 
               The other end answers.

                                     WILL
                              (voice cracking)
                         Hi.

               That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. 
               He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.

               MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

               INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY

               Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the 
               elevator.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in. She 
               strips the bed.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will 
               to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on 
               the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.

               He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to 
               find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied 
               to

               THE KEY TO THE CITY.

               He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.

               EXT. CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY

               Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-
               composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.

               Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE. 
               The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than 
               expected.

               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see 
               an Oldsmobile parking.

               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.

               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely 
               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be 
               70.

               It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.

               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT 
               UP to see this man is huge.

               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least 
               six-eight.

               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.

               EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY

               As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother 
               to a seat near the grave.

               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN 
               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses 
               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.

               It's PING and JING.

               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. 
               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing 
               steps forward. They're really two separate people. 

               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: 
               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]

               After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. 
               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling 
               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.

               We find Will watching them.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Have you ever heard a joke so many 
                         times you've forgotten why it's funny? 
                         But then you hear it again and 
                         suddenly it's new. You remember why 
                         you loved it in the first place.

               Will joins in, laughing.

               We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the 
               screen.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY [SUMMER]

               Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching 
               his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.

                                     SON
                              (to the other boys)
                         So he said he'd fight the giant who 
                         was fifteen feet tall.

                                     KID
                         No way.

                                     SON
                              (calling over)
                         Dad, that's right, isn't it?

                                     WILL
                         Something like that.

                                     SON
                         See. So he was a giant but my grampa 
                         was going to fight him because he 
                         wasn't afraid of anything because 
                         he'd seen how he was going to die in 
                         this old lady's glass eye...

               Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES. Sandra 
               takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         That was my father's final joke I 
                         guess. A man tells his stories so 
                         many times he becomes the stories. 
                         They live on after him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               EXT. RIVER / UNDERWATER - DAY

               A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And in that way, he becomes immortal.

               The fish passes us with a SPLASH.

               CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END

     CREDITS ROLL OVER

     Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from
     prize fights featuring two different boxers against various
     opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a
     counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a
     headhunting puncher.

     The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible
     showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck.

     END CREDITS

     CLOSE UP ON:

     A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old
     Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank
     spaces.

     INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943...
     REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT

     EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK

     A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
     LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The
     sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
     for their arrival.

     We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from
     the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.

     Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
     pound truncheon.

     BUCKY'S POV:

     Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-
     fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.

     Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
     hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen
     to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against
     the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.

     Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls
     quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.

     Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--

     away from the action...

     down a side street and onto a

     QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.

     He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a
     voice:

                          VOICE
               Bleichert! Bleichert!

     EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME

     A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
     ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.

     The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
     fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,
     dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.

                          VOICE OVER
               I already knew him by reputation, had our
               respective records down pat: Lee
               Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,
               formerly a regular attraction at the
               Hollywood Legion Stadium.

     The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard,
     trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
     marines' blows with his own truncheon.

                          LEE BLANCHARD
               Code three, Bleichert!

     Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in,
     fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.

                          VOICE OVER
               And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-
               heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring
               magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
               opponents in no-man's-land division.

     On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
     marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft
     midsections.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               In our first year at Central we'd never
               spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions
               about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight, and who would win.

     And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows
     to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into
     a heap.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by
               early KO; Bleichert by decision;
               Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but
               Bleichert by knockout.

     The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his
     attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads
     him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.

     Lee turns back to the marines:

                          LEE
               To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.

     One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest
     as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.

     The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be
     heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the Zooter)
               Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos
               Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive
               warrant for manslaughter committed during
               the commission of a Class B Felony.
               Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she
               keeled of a heart attack.

                          BUCKY
               You come all the way down here to roust--

                          LEE
                   (smiling)
               I came all the way down here same as you
               did.
                   (jerks a finger to the riots)
               Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see
               those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--
                   (nudging Dos Santos)
               Habla Ingles, Tomas?

     The man shakes his head "no".

                          LEE (cont'd)
               He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas
               chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's
               about six weeks away from the Big Adios.
               Been better off getting a couple cracked
               ribs from our Privates First Class back
               there.

     Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front
     porch.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We'll never get him booked tonight.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER

     Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The
     three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from
     the kitchen cupboard.

     Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The
     Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and
     passing out.

     Bucky covers him with a blanket.

                          LEE
               Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the
               month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In
               three years I'll be working Central
               Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there
               wets his pants for fighters. Promised me
               the next spot he can wangle.

                          BUCKY
                   (not impressed)
               Impressive.

                          LEE
                   (not impressed either)
               Wanna hear something more impressive? My
               first twenty fights were stumblebums
               handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend
               saw you fight a couple times over at the
               Olympic. Says maybe you could take me.

     Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the
     kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames.

                          BUCKY
               Whatta we do about the Mex?

                          LEE
               We'll take 'em in the morning.

                          BUCKY
               You'll take him.

                          LEE
               He's half yours, partner.

                          BUCKY
               He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.

                          LEE
                   (without turning)
               Someday.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A CLOSE UP OF TOMAS DOS SANTOS' FACE

     screaming in silence.

     AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     Tomas Dos Santos dying in a large Plexiglas GAS CHAMBER.
     Bucky stands in the back of the room, forcing himself to
     watch. He can't stand it and leaves.

     IN THE FRONT ROW

     Lee also watches, elbows on knees and chin in hands. He can't
     stand it, either. He stays.

     IN THE HALLWAY AFTERWARDS

     Bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake Lee's hand and
     brush imaginary lint off of his BRAND NEW SERGEANT'S STRIPES.
     Their eyes meet briefly as Bucky retreats to daylight.

     EXT. 2ND AND BEAUDRY - DAY

     An extremely bored Bucky Bleichert gives a man a speeding
     ticket and sends him on his way.

     EXT./INT. RADIO PATROL CAR - MOVING

     Bucky drives as a ROOKIE COP chatters in the seat next to
     him.

                          ROOKIE
               Yep, three years in the Canal Zone.
               Nothin' but skeeter bites and drunk
               fights over three-dollar skank tail...

     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

     Bucky sits at his desk filling out a form as the rookie cop
     prattles on in the background.

                          ROOKIE
               ...fights over three-dollar skank tail...

     AN OLDER OFFICER

     walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes. Catching Bucky's
     look, the cop throws him a shadow punching one-two. Bucky
     smiles thinly. Returns to his paperwork. Then another cop
     passes by and breaks into a bob-and-weave. Bucky looks
     puzzled and annoyed.

     He grabs a third cop walking by (TOM JOSLIN).

                          BUCKY
               Somethin' up, Tommy?

                          TOM
               You, that's what.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               You know Lee Blanchard over at Central
               Warrants?

     Bucky nods.

                          TOM
               His partner's toppin' his twenty and
               goin' for early retirement. Word is the
               felony D.A.'s lookin' for a bright boy to
               fill the spot. Christ knows why but it's
               down to you and Johnny Vogel for the
               spot.

     Bucky takes a surreptitious peek across the room at JOHNNY
     VOGEL, fat, slick-hair and bad skin.

                          BUCKY
               His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick.

                          TOM
                   (chucking Bucky on the chin)
               But who'd look better when they bring back
               the boxing team, eh Buckaroo?

     Bucky shakes his head, dismissing the whole thing.

     INT. THE RADIO PATROL CAR - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks...

                          VOICE OVER
               Warrants was local celebrity as a cop.
               Warrants was plainclothes without a coat
               and tie, romance and a mileage per diem
               on your civilian car. Warrants was going
               after the real bad guys and not rousting
               winos and wienie waggers in front of the
               Midnight Mission.

     INT. BUCKY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky hits a speed-bag, building up a sweat.

                          VOICE OVER
               I told myself I didn't care.

     He hits the bag faster and faster.

     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY

     A desk officer hands Bucky a note.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CITY HALL - CHIEF OF DETECTIVES OFFICE - LATER

     A secretary leads Bucky into an office with CHIEF OF
     DETECTIVES THAD GREEN etched on the pebble glass door.

     Inside the office: Lee Blanchard, ASST. D.A. ELLIS LOEW, and
     CHIEF THAD GREEN. They all sit in matched leather chairs.

                          SECRETARY
               Officer Bleichert.

     She exits. An awkward silence.

                          LEE
                   (getting to his feet)
               Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert. Bucky, Chief
               Thad Green, Deputy DA Ellis Loew.

     Bucky shakes their hands, nodding to each.  Chief Green
     gestures for him to sit.

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Read this aloud, Officer. It's running in
               Sunday's Times.

                          BUCKY
               "Before the war, the City of the Angels
               was graced with two local fighters, born
               and raised a scant five miles apart,
               pugilists with styles as different as
               fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a
               bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger--

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Skip down to the fire and ice part.

                          BUCKY
                   (searching, finding)
               "Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each
               other, but a sense of duty brought them
               together in spirit, and both joined the
               Los Angeles Police Department." Blanchard
               cracked the baffling Boulevard-Citizens
               bank robbery case in 1939 and captured
               thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos; Bleichert
               served with distinction during the '43
               Zoot Suit Wars--"

     A glance to Lee...

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Skip to the end.

                          BUCKY
               "Both men made great sacrifices to serve
               their city, and on Election Day, voters
               are going to be asked to do the same
               thing--vote on a five million dollar bond
               proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment
               and provide for an eight percent pay
               raise for all personnel. Keep in mind the
               examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice. Vote
               "Yes" on Proposition B."

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Whattya think?

                          BUCKY
               Subtle.

     Blanchard and Green smile; Loew frowns.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Prop. B's looking like a loser right now.
               But if we can drum up some publicity we
               may he able to get it passed in the '47
               Special. We need to build up morale in
               the department.
               Impress voters with the quality of our
               men. Wholesome white boxers are a big
               draw, Bleichert. You know that.

     Bucky looks to Lee.

                          LEE
               Fire and Ice.

                          LOEW
               Ten rounds. The Academy Gym. Three weeks
               from now. Right before the election. All
               the gate to charity. After that, we bring
               back the interdivisional boxing team.
               Wholesome fighters.

                          LEE
               Wholesome.

                          CHIEF GREEN
               Are you in, Bucky?

                          LEE
               It's not like you'll last the ten rounds
               anyway.

     Bucky eyes Lee quickly, assessing his larger but slightly
     softer physique.

     All the remaining eyes are on him.

                          BUCKY
               I'm in.

     Back slaps and congratulations all around.

                          LOEW
               I'm betting on great things from you,
               Bleichert. And if I don't miss my bet we
               may be colleagues soon.

                          BUCKY
               Uh, yes sir.

     EXT. THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER

     Bucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car
     talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut.

     Lee waves Bucky over.

                          LEE
               Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.

                          BUCKY
               Hello.

                          FAY
               I saw you fight a couple times. You won.

                          BUCKY
               I always won. You a fight fan?

                          KAY
               Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme
               art classes so I'd sketch the boxers.

     Lee puts his arm around her.

                          LEE
               Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't
               want me doin' the "vegetable shuffle."

     He staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter.

                          BUCKY
               I'll try not to hurt you.

     A flicker of anger in her eyes.

                          LEE
               Sure make Loew happy.

                          BUCKY
               He's got money on me, I gather?

                          LEE
               Seems that way.

                          BUCKY
               And if I win I get Warrants?

                          LEE
               Seems that way.

     Bucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay.

                          BUCKY
               What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?

                          KAY
               For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets
               ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
               For financial reasons I hope Lee wins.
               And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both
               look good with your shirts off.

     Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand.
     Lee takes it.

                          BUCKY
               Luck short of winning.

                          LEE
               You, too.

     Bucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go.

                          KAY
               Luck, Dwight.

     He stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting
     to see his reaction so he keeps walking...

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY

     Bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired
     neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full
     of canned goods and old girlie magazines.

     ON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE

     a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at
     some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     disgust and sadness.

     This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches,
     pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even
     worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow
     rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy
     shirt.

                          BUCKY
               Papa?

                          DOLPH
               Guten tag, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Speak English, papa.

                          DOLPH
               Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!

     He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.

     Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the
     dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood
     airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen,
     nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...

     BACK ON THE PORCH

     Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.

                          BUCKY
               Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me
               how you can fuck this place up so bad in
               one month.

                          DOLPH
               Du, Dwight? Du?

                          BUCKY
               Speak...English. Papa, please.

     He searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none.

     He surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his
     eye we see the glint of an idea...

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

     Bucky on the phone.

                          BUCKY
               ...He's had another stroke. If you could
               just come by and clean the place up and
               keep an eye on him for week or so...a
               hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten
               days. I promise. I do. Thank you.

     INT. THE POLICE BOXING GYM

     Bucky leans against a wall watching Lee spar. Studying him.
     Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight.

                          VOICE OVER
               He was better than I thought. It made
               what came next easier.

     INT. A BANK - DAY

     Bucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out
     forms. The manager counts out approximately $4,500 in cash.
     Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash.

     INT. THE GOOD LUCK BAR - NIGHT

     Bucky slides into a booth across from PETE LUKINS.

                          PETE
               So...I'm surprised but I'm not so
               surprised. I hear you been lookin' good.
               Better'n people think.

     Bucky pushes an envelope across to Pete. He looks in it.

                          PETE (cont'd)
               I guess what I hear is correct. Then
               you'll be wantin' to place this with
               Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard
               2 to 1--

                          BUCKY
               I'm not bettin' on me, Pete.

                          PETE
                   (a beat)
               Oh.
                   (another beat)
               Then as a friend I feel it's my duty to
               tell you this: you better make it look
               good.

                          BUCKY
               Knockout between rounds eight and ten.

     Pete nods his head, thinking.

                          PETE
               Dragna's got a guy really sold on you.
               Even money. Best you're gonna get.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks, Pete.

     Pete sticks out his hand.

                          PETE
               Luck.

                          BUCKY
               Short of winning?

                          PETE
               Luck.

     Bucky takes his hand.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Bucky takes apart his sparring partner with a series of
     lightning quick counterpunches.

                          VOICE OVER
               I'd almost finished the Police Academy
               when the background check turned up my
               father's German-American Bund membership.
               Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my
               patriotism, I gave the Alien Squad Sam
               Murakawa, a guy I'd grown up with, in
               order to secure my LAPD appointment.

     EXT. DOLPH BLEICHERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky watches from across the street as AN OFF-DUTY NURSE
     tries to get Papa Bleichert to eat a sandwich.

                          VOICE OVER
               The old fuck never knew any better. Never
               knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd
               died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the
               snitch's jacket and with a little
               alteration I slipped easily into the
               whole suit.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Bucky watches Lee spar. His quick eyes spying:

     --scar tissue over Lee's right eye

     --Lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook

     --Lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I had traded Warrants for a close-out on
               bad old debts, the eight grand I was
               gonna clear enough to maintain the old
               man in a good clean rest home for three
               years; the late round tank job enough to
               convince myself I wasn't a complete
               coward.

     INT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY

     Kay approaches Bucky as he studies Lee.

                          KAY
               At least he looks good with his shirt
               off.

     She waves to Lee between rounds. He blows a kiss back.

                          BUCKY
               Where's your sketch pad?

                          KAY
               I was never very good. Ended up with a
               degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight
               money paid for it.

                          BUCKY
               Education's an expensive habit to kick.
                   (beat)
               He shouldn't have quit fighting.

                          KAY
               I asked him to. Besides, catching
               animals gave him a sense of order. You
               have a girlfriend, Dwight?

                          BUCKY
               Saving myself for Rita Hayworth.

     A roar from the gym onlookers. Lee's sparring partner hits
     the deck, blood spraying from his mouth.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Quits fighting for you. Puts you through
               school. Quite a guy. Quite a pair.

                          KAY
                   (flirting)
               We're not getting married if that's what
               you're wondering.

                          BUCKY
               Why not? Shacking's against the regs.
               Probably cost him a stripe.

                          KAY
               I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow
               night.

                          BUCKY
               You didn't answer my question--

                          KAY
                   (a throwaway)
               Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight.

     She keeps walking. He just stares...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A half-eaten steak and two beers gone. It's six hours later
     and Bucky's still thinking about Kay's exit line. Restless.
     He grabs his jacket.

     INT. HEARST BUILDING - HERALD-EXAMINER MORGUE - NIGHT

     Bucky flashes his badge to a late-night clerk who escorts him
     into the newspaper's morgue. Pulls a bound stack of newspaper 
     clippings and gives them to Bucky. He begins poring through
     them...

     A newspaper photo of a BANK shifts into live action:

     A GRAINY NEWSREEL-TYPE FLASHBACK (SLO-MO)

     An armored truck idles in front of the Boulevard-Citizens
     Bank. Three men dressed in guard uniforms run out of the
     front of the bank, an alarm keening in the background.

     Three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle
     ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man
     (the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck. The truck
     takes off, able to escape when someone from inside the truck
     throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound
     legitimate guards out the back and into the line of
     pursuit...

                          VOICE OVER
               With no lead on the two escaped men, the
               heist quickly went from page one to page
               five. Two weeks later...

     A newspaper clipping headline: "Tip from Ex-boxer cop
     breaks B-C Bank Job"

     A still photo of Lee which becomes live action as...

     INT. A SMALL VENICE BEACH APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

     A younger Lee and four other cops tear apart a small flat. In
     a closet they find BANK GUARD UNIFORMS, BANK BAGS, and a
     small stash of MARIJUANA.

                          VOICE OVER
               One of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby
               DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard
               long rap, as the brains behind the bank
               job.

                                                            CUT TO:

     FLASHBACK: A HATCHET FACED MAN (DEWITT) LED BY HANDCUFFS
     THROUGH A GIANT CROWD...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               DeWitt howled frame-up the entire trial,
               never ID'ing the driver or coughing up
               the dough, even after damning character
               testimony from some of his employees,
               including one Katherine Lake, formerly of
               Sioux Falls, South Dakota and looking to
               go straight.

     FLASHBACK: LEE LEADING KAY FROM THE COURTROOM, HAND ON HER
     ELBOW...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               DeWitt got ten to life at San Quentin;
               Lee got Kay, or maybe the other way
               around.

     BACK TO PRESENT: Bucky walks through downtown L.A., hands
     stuffed in his pockets like James Dean...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               They both got a few weeks in the gossip
               pages before Kay dove into her college
               education and Lee down the hero's road
               ending in Warrants and a shack job with a
               woman he loved but wouldn't touch...

     Bucky passes A WHORE on the corner, their eyes meet for a
     moment and he walks on.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               You come off a winning fight. Sweat-
               drenched, tasting blood, still wanting to
               go. The handbooks who made money on you
               bring you a girl. A pro, a semi-pro. You
               do it in the dressing room, or a hallway.
               The eleventh round of a ten round fight.
               And when you go back to an ordinary life,
               it's just weakness, a loss.

     Bucky turns back to give the whore a second look but she's gone.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               To a fighter, sex tastes like blood and
               resin and suture scrub. I wondered if
               some day that would ever be different.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A HAMMER HITTING A BELL

     and the fight is on.

     INSIDE THE PACKED ACADEMY GYM

     Cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like
     L.A. haze as

     LEE CHARGES BUCKY, the big man trying to cut of the ring.
     Bucky engages, dodging Lee's thundering blows and peppering
     back with counterpunches...

     **The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal
     match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to
     make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth
     or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins
     trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other
     badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight.
     Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy.
     Lee knocks Bucky out.

     INT. BUCKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Bucky lies in bed, radio playing jazz. He looks horrible--
     face swollen, lip split, stitches across his nose. He sips
     whiskey from a bottle through a straw.

     The phone rings and rings. He refuses to answer it...

     INT. A REST HOME - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky, bruised but somewhat better, stands in the hallway of
     a very nice rest home. He surreptitiously watches his father
     as the old man tries to grab at a nurse.

     EXT. THE REST HOME - MINUTES LATER

     Pete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky.

                          PETE
               Well?

                          BUCKY
               He'll catch on soon enough.

     The scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on
     the facility:

     KING DAVID VILLA

     Jewish stars adorn the sign.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Bucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches
     with scissors. He hears a voice outside his window.

                          VOICE OVER
               Hey. Canvasback!

     Bucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window.

     EXT. THE COURTYARD - SAME

     Lee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard.

                          LEE
               You gonna hide in there another week?
               Ain't you bored yet?

                          BUCKY
               Gettin' there.

                          LEE
               Wanna work Warrants with me?

                          BUCKY
               What?

                          LEE
               Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You
               been hibernating--

                          BUCKY
               But I lost. Loew's deal--

                          LEE
               Don't you read the papers? The bond issue
               passed yesterday. Want the job, partner?

     Off Lee's devilish grin:

                          VOICE OVER
               Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the
               snitch.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING

     A door marked "DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM". Bucky, wearing his
     best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door.

     INSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM

     Full of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give
     Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the
     crowd.

     On the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!!

     CAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium.

                          TIERNEY
                   (as introduction)
               Officer Bleichert, the men of Central
               Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et
               cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and
               Lee are the white men of the hour, so I
               hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't
               get another one until you retire.

     Everyone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Enough horseshit. This is the felony
               summary for the week ending November 14,
               1946. First, three liquor store
               stickups...

     Tierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the
     room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and
     ties... He tunes back in...

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack
               to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have
               you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill
               burglaries?

     FRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant-
     looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny).
     The two men shake their heads "no". Tierney disapproves.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Set of latents at the last break-in ID's
               one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A
               surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got
               four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's
               our boy, maybe not. But between that and
               the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high
               priority lamster right now. There's a
               list of his known associates on the
               bulletin board. Let's all take a look...

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

     The meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD)
     and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (introducing himself)
               Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids
               thank you for the raise, Officer.

     Bucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
                   (re the other man)
               My partner, Harry Sears.

                          HARRY
                   (stuttering)
               Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B-
               Bleichert.

     Before Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and
     leads him away.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central
               Warrants--

     When he gets him out of ear shot:

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               You shouldn't have slugged with him. You
               were ahead on all three cards.

                          BUCKY
               The proposition passed, sir.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Yes but some of your patron's lost money.
               Play things smarter here. Don't blow this
               like you blew the fight.

     Bucky's about to respond when Lee saves him--

                          LEE
               Ready to roll, canvasback?

     He grabs Bucky and they head out the door.

     INT. LEE'S CAR - LATER

     Lee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job
     description.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you really quit fighting?

     He pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant.

                          LEE
                   (matter of fact)
               Benny Siegel bought out my contract,
               scared off my manager. Said he'd get me a
               shot at Joe Louis if I'd take two dives
               for him. I said no, joined the Department
               'cuz Jew syndicate boys won't kill cops.
               Anything else?

                          BUCKY
                   (as they exit the car)
               One more. What are we doin' here?

                          LEE
               While you were dancing with Ellis at
               muster I checked Maynard Coleman's KA's
               on the bulletin and recognized the name
               of a fence. Think he tends bar here...

     INSIDE THE RESTAURANT

     Lee and Bucky slide into a booth on either side of BRUNO
     ALBANESE, halfway through plate of huevos rancheros.

                          LEE
               Bruno Albanese?

                          BRUNO
               Who wants to know?

                          LEE
               Police officers, Bruno. Let's make this
               fast so I don't have to watch you eat.

     Lee slides the Maynard Coleman mug shot to Albanese.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We know he sells to you and we don't
               care. Where is he?

     Albanese burps.

                          BRUNO
               Never seen 'em before.

     Lee sighs. And then grabs Bruno by the back of the neck and
     jams his face into the hot cheese and goo of his food.
     Bruno's arms flap back and forth as Lee drowns him in his
     food.

     Finally Lee shrugs and pulls Bruno's face out of his food,
     blood from his nose mixing with the grease of the enchiladas.

                          BRUNO
               Versailles apartments. Sixth and St.
               Andrews.

     EXT. THE VERSAILLES APARTMENTS - MINUTES LATER

     Lee and Bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as
     MAYNARD COLEMAN trots down the front stairs and gets into a
     car.

                          BUCKY
               Right there!

     They ease the car back into traffic and follow Coleman's car
     from a safe distance. Bucky picks up the two-way radio. Lee
     gestures for him to put it back:

     Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE,
     an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.

     Coleman exits his car, eyeing a group of kids carrying ice
     skates and heading into the Polar Palace. He follows them
     inside...

     The two men follow...

     INSIDE THE POLAR PALACE

     Children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear
     suit. Lee and Bucky scan the area--not an adult in sight. Lee
     spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to
     Bucky, who hustles down them.

     ON THE STAIRCASE

     Maynard Coleman, carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit, walks up
     the stairs toward Bucky. Just as the two men pass Bucky PULLS
     HIS GUN and puts it to Coleman's head.

                          BUCKY
               Police officer. You're under arrest.

     Coleman throws his hands in the air; the bunny drops to the
     ground. Bucky cuffs Coleman and leads him up the stairs as
     Lee comes down from above.

     A small voice from below Bucky:

                          VOICE OVER
               Let go of him! Let go of him!

     Bucky looks down to see A SMALL BOY pounding on his leg. The
     kid's hysterical.

                          BOY
               Let go a my daddy! Daddy!

     The resemblance is unmistakable. Two generations of Okie
     white trash. Bucky continues marching Coleman the elder up
     the stairs as Lee snags the kid, both the father and the son
     crying like babies.

     INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE JAIL - LATER

     Lee and Bucky fill out a release form for the desk officer.

     Bucky looks up to see BILL KOENIG and FRITZ VOGEL march by
     with barely a nod.

                          LEE
               They got here fast.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               The confession.

     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - LATER

     Lee finishes typing up a report on a manual typewriter while
     Bucky talks on the phone. He hangs up as Fritz Vogel and Bill
     Koenig return.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the two meatheads)
               Play nice. They've got juice with Loew.

                          KOENIG
                   (stupid and proud)
               He confessed. Kiddie porks and the
               burglaries. Fritzie says we're all
               getting commendations.

     Bucky's POV: both Koenig and Vogel have small bits of
     blood spattered on their white dress shirts.

                          VOGEL
               Ellis loves the kid angle.

                          LEE
               You talk to Ellis?

                          VOGEL
               He's only "Ellis" to lieutenants on up,
               Blanchard.

                          LEE
               Least I don't call him "kike".

                          VOGEL
                   (flushing)
               C'mon, Billy.

     The two men push by with barely a nod in Bucky's direction.
                          BUCKY
               Play nice. Hm.

                          LEE
               Shitbirds.

     HARRY SEARS approaches their cubicle. He looks a little
     drunk. (And when you get to know him you'll realize that when
     he's drunk he doesn't stutter.)

                          HARRY
               Russ says good collar today.

     The men nod thanks. Bucky notes the lack of stutter and the
     presence of a liquor smell.

                          HARRY (cont'd)
               And Lee--I heard something you oughta
               know--I was over at County Parole--Bobby
               DeWitt got an "A" number. He'll be
               released to LA around mid-January.

     Lee bobs his head slightly as Harry moves off. He's disturbed
     but covers quickly--

                          LEE
               You like pot roast?

     EXT. A BEAUTIFUL DECO HOME - NIGHT

     Lee leads Bucky up the walk. Bucky's impressed with the house.

                          LEE
               Don't say anything to Kay about DeWitt.
               It'll upset her.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A doll's house of Danish Modern furniture, fresh flowers and
     polished mahogany wainscoting.

                          BUCKY
               You takin' bribes, partner?

                          LEE
               Fight stash.

     Kay arrives from the kitchen, smiling broadly at Bucky. She
     takes his hand.

                          KAY
               Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it.

     And holds his hand about two beats than usual...

     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

     Kay brings in the food. Bucky walks around the room, checking
     things out.

                          FAY
               Fairy tale come true, isn't it?

                          BUCKY
               Hm?

                          FAY
               The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy
               tale.

                          BUCKY
               Can't say I believe in fairy tales.

                          KAY
               Then you've never really had to. Lucky
               man. (beat) Lee! Dinner!

     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER

     The food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops
     another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone
     laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again.

                          LEE
               A toast...To Proposition B!

                          BUCKY
               To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch!
               Bigger than Louis/Schmeling!

                          KAY
               To fairy tales!

                          BUCKY
                   (abruptly, drunk)
               To...us!

     He's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't
     escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT:

     JANUARY 10, 1947...Raymond "Junior" Nash...

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are
     joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.

     Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline:
     "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48
     Primary?"

     Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into
     the room--

                          LEE
               Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a
               quote. (as FDR) "The only thing to fear
               is fear itself."

     Loew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Here's the man to fear.

     ANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET:

     RAYMOND "JUNIOR" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery,
     felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz...

     The cops are impressed.

                          BUCKY
               Give us the good news. He's in LA and
               actin' uppity?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Witnesses made him at a stickup near
               Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol-
               whipped an old lady. She died about an
               hour ago.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything common in the sex beefs?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Negro girls. Young ones. All the
               complainants have been colored.

                          LEE
               Seeya in Leimert Park.

     As they walk out...

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the
               man. I'd like to do it in court.

     Lee flashes a demon smile.

     EXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY - LATER

     A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw 
     Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom.

                          VOICE OVER
               From November through the New Year, Lee
               and I captured a total of eleven hard
               felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and
               three parole and probation absconders...

     On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated
     houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by
     giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo
     shopping centers and movie theaters.

                          VOICE OVER
               After tours of duty, Lee and I would go
               to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she
               made dinner for us, other times the three
               of us would go dancing, or see a flick.

     Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more
     unkempt. Empty lots...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Always she'd be there, never in between
               us, but always in the middle. It was the
               best time of my life.

     EXT./INT. THE CAR - A FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS

     Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the
     car--

                          LEE
               This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm
               callin' in some favors.

     He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.

     BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER

     Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.

                          LEE
               Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's
               shacking with some poon in a crib near
               Slauson and Hoover.

                          BUCKY
               It's all colored down there--

                          LEE
               We fuckin' roll.

     He pulls out.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER

     Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner.
     Three are black and one is white.

                          LEE
               Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address
               or a name.

     As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start
     the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white
     guy glances at Lee:

                          WHITE HOPHEAD
               What the---Blanchard?

                          LEE
               Shut up, shitbird.

     Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him.
     Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some
     marijuana cigarettes.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man
     closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--

                          BUCKY
               Partner!

     Bucky pulls his .38...

     THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the
     face--

     THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in
     the neck--

     ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for
     something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.

                          LEE
               Bucky duck!

     Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and
     the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots
     cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.

     Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood-
     covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.

     FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.

     Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket.
     Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside
     out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from
     the blood.

     All the while Lee cries like a baby.

     INT. THE 77TH ST. DETECTIVES' STATION - LATER

     Bucky and a Detective exit a de-briefing room. Bucky looks
     worn but composed.

                          DETECTIVE
               Thank you for your time, Officer. And
               your police work, as well.

     They pass another de-briefing area where Lee sits with
     another Detective. Lee looks terrible, muttering and
     shivering.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Your partner's taking this hard.

                          BUCKY
               He knew one of the guys. Baxter Fitch.
               Busted him once for loitering. Sort of
               liked the guy.

     The detective nods sympathetically.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by
     Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.

                          KAY
               Oh baby. Oh babe.

     She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the
     front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.

     "Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."

     Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky
     begins to read it when he hears from inside:

                          LEE
               Leave me alone! You'll never fucking
               understand--

     A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring
     off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to
     Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               He knew one of the guys.

     She nods.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It was them or us.

     She nods again.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Tomorrow's off-duty so treat him nice--

                          KAY
               Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight.
               We're on edge. He swore at the trial he
               was going to kill Lee.

                          BUCKY
               We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.

                          KAY
               Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.

                          BUCKY
               I know as much as I need to know.

     Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and
     goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading
     the paper.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - LATER

     Bucky wanders inside, obviously fidgety and not wanting to go
     home. He putters around their living room. From the back of
     the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.

     Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of
     the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.

     He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:

     Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit.
     She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.

     Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression
     passive and fixed even when their eyes meet. She pirouettes
     for him, showing:

     A SERIES OF OLD KNIFE SCARS CRISS-CROSSING HER BACK FROM
     THIGH TO SPINE.

     The history of Bobby DeWitt.

     Bucky backs away, retreating as he chokes back tears.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

     Bucky's awakened by the phone ringing. He pulls the receiver
     off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand. From the
     receiver he barely hears:

                          LEE
               Rise and shine partner!

     Bucky grabs the phone.

                          BUCKY
               Lee? You okay?

                          LEE
               Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and
               ten. Played house with Kay all day
               yesterday. Feel like doing some police
               work?

                          BUCKY
               Keep going.

                          LEE
               Junior Nash's got a fuck pad on Norton
               and Coliseum.

     EXT. THE CORNER OF COLISEUM AND NORTON - SOON AFTER

     Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.

     INT. RAYMOND NASH'S ROOM - SOON AFTER

     They push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop
     littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers.

                          LEE
               Okie trash.

     They poke around for a minute, finding nothing. The smell is
     awful. Bucky goes to a window and pulls it open.

     HIS POV OUT THE WINDOW:

     IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE WAY

     A cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare
     at something in the weeds. A CORONER'S VAN parks next to
     three black and whites and two detectives' sedans.

                          BUCKY
               Lee.

     Lee goes to the window.

                          LEE
               Is that Millard and Sears?

     An LAPD PHOTO VAN pulls up next.

     Lee and Bucky sprint out of the room.

     EXT. THE VACANT LOT - 39TH AND NORTON - SECONDS LATER

     Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos.
     Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full
     view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the
     front and see:

     The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the
     waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty
     cavity--her organs have been removed.

     Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a
     leering smile.

     Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They
     point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief
     and disorder when

     RUSS MILLARD

     whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Before this gets out of hand let's put
               the kibosh on something. If this gets a
               lot of publicity we're going to get a lot
               of confessions. So we keep some things
               quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You
               keep this information to yourselves. Not
               your wives, not your girlfriends, no
               other officers.

     The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               No reporters view the body. You photo
               men, take your pictures now. Coroner's
               men, you put a sheet on the body as soon
               as they're done. Set up a perimeter six
               feet back. Any reporter crosses it,
               arrest him.
                   (noticing Bucky)
               Bleichert. What are you doing here?
               Where's Blanchard?

     Bucky indicates Lee, crouched down by the body taking notes.

                          BUCKY
               Nash is renting a room in that building
               over there.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Blood on the premises?

                          BUCKY
               No. This isn't him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               The lab'll be the judge of that.

     Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging
     onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and
     photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming
     up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.

     Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at
     the body.

                          BUCKY
               Hey. Junior Nash, remember?

                          LEE
               He didn't do this.

                          BUCKY
               No. He beat an old woman to death. That's
               why he's our priority warrantee.

                          LEE
               Not anymore.

                          BUCKY
               This ain't ours, partner--

                          LEE
                   (on edge)
               It is now, partner.

     EXT. THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

     Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's
     wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away.

     RUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS

     as fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their 
     assignment.

     A MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING

     Cops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park:

                          OFFICER
                   (to an old woman)
               Have you heard female screams...

                          BUCKY
                   (to an off-duty serviceman)
               ...anyone discarding women's clothing?

                          LEE
                   (to a little kid)
               ...seen anyone in the lot on 39th...

                          BUCKY
                   (to a housewife)
               ...and what about this man?
                   (holds out a photo of Junior
                    Nash)

     To all of these questions a big fat "no".

     INT. THE OLYMPIC BOXING ARENA - NIGHHT

     Bucky watches two Mexican bantamweights beat each other
     bloody. An EMPTY SEAT next to him. Irritated, he gets up and
     leaves.

     ENT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

     Bucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the
     crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds.
     The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two
     quicklime outlines of the body parts.

                          BUCKY
               You were supposed to meet me at the
               fights tonight, remember?

                          LEE
               Priority. Remember.

                          BUCKY
               Priority for the Bureau. Not for us.

                          LEE
               Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show
               the voters they did the right thing
               passing the bond issue. It's a showcase.
               It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this.

                          BUCKY
               We've had enough headlines for the week.

     Lee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and
     maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something.

                          LEE
               With or without you, partner.

     Bucky shakes his head and begins walking away.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               With or without you.

                          BUCKY
               I heard you.

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

     Bucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page
     headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying"

     Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a
     bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion:

                          OFFICER
               Confessors.

     Just then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig
     leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door.

                          KOENIG
               He didn't do it.

     A couple officers clap satirically at their desks.

                          BUCKY
                   (to another cop)
               Blanchard?

                          OFFICER
               In with Loew.(beat) And reporters.

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Bucky walks in to see Loew holding a press conference, Lee
     dressed in a suit and sitting at his side.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               ...and the heinous nature of this killing
               makes it imperative to catch this fiend
               as soon as possible. A number of
               specially trained officers, including Mr.
               Fire and his partner Mr. Ice...

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     Disbelief. Disgust.

     BACK IN THE WARRANTS CUBICLE - LATER

     Lee catches up with a pissed off Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               You got us detached?

                          LEE
               Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a
               memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction--

                          BUCKY
               You did what?

                          LEE
               It's all right. The APB still stands.
               We've got the pad staked. He's covered.

     Bucky's face says he's not sold on Lee's reasoning.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               One week. Just one week. After that, it's
               back to Junior. I promise.

     Bucky studies Lee's resolve; he relents.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               Copacetic.

     INT. PATHOLOGY ROOM - LATER

     Antiseptic white with metallic slab tables. Two objects
     covered in sheets lay on the table.

     Bucky, Lee, Russ Millard and Harry Sears sit on benches
     facing the table. THE CORONER and a STENOGRAPHER NUN stand
     over the body. The coroner pulls the sheets off.

                          LEE
               Jesus, Bucky.

                          CORONER
               On gross pathology, we have a female
               Caucasian between sixteen and thirty.
               Cadaver is presented in two halves with
               bisection level with the umbilicus.

     The nun scribbles furiously to keep up. The officers are torn
     between staring at their shoes and at the body.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               ...Through-and through laceration from
               both mouth corners...no visible signs of
               neck bruises...massive depressed skull
               fractures...Inspection of upper half
               abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing
               blood. Intestines, stomach, liver and
               spleen removed.

     The doctor stops to allow the nun time to catch up. Russ
     Millard clears his throat.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Is it...all right to smoke, doctor?

                          CORONER
               She's not going to mind.

     Both Russ and Harry light up.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               Lower half of the cadaver reveals removal
               of reproductive organs...Both legs broken
               at the knee, and healing, light lash
               marks on the upper back and shoulders...

     The door opens and a police officer enters, handing a sheet
     of paper to Millard and speaking to him briefly. Millard
     reads the sheet and hands it to Harry, who then hands it to
     Lee.

                          LEE
                   (reading)
               Bingo.

     He hands it to Bucky.

     The note: "Girl ID'd as Elizabeth Ann Short, DOB
     7/29/24, Medford, Mass."

     The coroner steps back from the table.

                          CORONER
               Questions?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What's your best guess?

                          CORONER
               Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped,
               she wasn't pregnant, dried semen
               indicates voluntary intercourse within
               the last week...She took what I'd call a
               gentle whipping in the last ten days...In
               terms of the nitty-gritty...She was
               probably tortured with a knife for thirty-
               six to forty-eight hours before death.
               The cause of which is either the mouth
               wound or more likely she was beaten to
               death with something like a baseball bat.

                          LEE
               What about her insides?

                          CORONER
               They came out after death. Then I'd say
               he drained the blood from the body and
               washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.

                          LEE
               Did the guy know anything about medicine
               or anatomy?

                          CORONER
               Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type--but
               that doesn't rule out veterinary
               training, biological training, or my
               Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA.
               Has she got a name yet?

     The cops look to each other, hesitant to speak her name.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Elizabeth Short.

                          CORONER
                   (saluting heaven)
               God love you, Elizabeth.
                   (to Millard)
               Russell, when you get the son of a bitch
               who did this to her, give him a kick in
               the balls and tell him it's from
               Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you
               get out of here, I've got a date with a
               jumper suicide in ten minutes.

     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - LATER

     Jack Tierney posts mug shots of Elizabeth Short as Russ,
     Harry, Lee and Bucky look over his shoulder. (In the
     background we can hear the by-now constant droning of Ellis
     Loew to reporters, both in person and over the phone)

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara.
               Underage drinking. Other than that she's
               clean. Four sisters. Parents divorced.
               Father's here in LA. Hear he sold some
               old portrait photos of her to the Herald.

     Russ makes a noise of disgust.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               How many confessions so far?

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Eighteen.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Double that by morning. More if Loew got
               the press excited with his purple prose.

                          LOEW
                   (he's been eavesdropping)
               I'd say my prose fits the crime,
               Lieutenant.

     Reveal Loew with Koenig and Fritz Vogel behind him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis.
               If you were a policeman you'd know that.

     Loew flushes and gives Millard a dark look.

                          ELLIS LOEW
                   (to Tierney)
               Captain have you sent men to talk to the
               victim's father?

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Not yet, Ellis.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               How about Vogel and Koenig?

     Tierney looks to Millard. The second in command shakes his
     head ever so slightly. We understand that even though he's
     second in command to Jack he's in charge.

                          CAPTAIN JACK
               Aaah, Russ, who do you think we should
               send?

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DUSK

     A garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee
     and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer.

     A skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door,
     eyeing them narrowly.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Cops, huh?

     He leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident,
     soiled, worn and ugly.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               I've got an alibi, just in case you think
               I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and
               that is air tight.

     The two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility.

                          BUCKY
               I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This
               is Sergeant Blanchard. We'd like to
               express our condolences for the loss of
               your daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT
               I know who you are. Neither of you'da
               lasted a round with Gentleman Jim
               Jeffries.
               (beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She
               called the tune, she paid the piper.
               (beat) You wanna hear my alibi?

                          LEE
               Since you're so anxious to tell it.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty-
               seven straight hours. Refrigerator
               repairman. Twenty-seven straight and the
               last seventeen overtime. Call my boss.
               He'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn
               fart, and that's air tight.

                          BUCKY
               When was the last time you saw your
               daughter?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Betty came west in '43 with stars in her
               eyes. I promised her three squares and a
               five-spot if she kept the house tidy.

     The cops look around at the squalor.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Gave her the boot in July. She moved to
               Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple
               weeks later. Some soldier beat her up
               bad. Last I heard from her.

                          BUCKY
               Was that soldier her boyfriend?

     The old man lets out a hoot.

                          CLEO SHORT
               They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly
               and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong
               there. Betty believed in quantity before
               quality.

                          LEE
               You calling your own daughter a tramp?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't
               so bad.

     Lee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk.
     Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view
     Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of
     water...

                          BUCKY
               Any names, Mr. Short?

                          CLEO SHORT
               Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter.
                   (he drifts for a moment)
               Said she was looking for movie work
               but...just paraded the Boulevard in those
               black get-ups of hers.

     Lee returns to the room.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Who wouldn't get herself killed doin'
               that? Who? Who wouldn't?

     EXT. CLEO SHORT'S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

     The two men walk out, disgusted.

                          LEE
               Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire
               U.S. Armed forces as suspects.

                          BUCKY
               Flip to see who writes it up?

                          LEE
               I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See
               if we get any strange drive-bys at the
               murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in
               on Kay. She's worried about me.

                          BUCKY
               She's a smart woman.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the
     couch. She doesn't even look up.

                          KAY
               Hi, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               How'd you know it was me?

                          KAY
               Lee stomps, you tread lightly.

     Bucky appreciates her subtext.

                          BUCKY
               Lee's--

                          KAY
               Let me guess...Lee's up all night--
               probably on Benzedrine again--working
               that poor girl's murder--

     She says this as fact, not judgement. She knows him.

                          KAY
               You're worried about him. And he's
               worried about me.
                   (beat)
               But who's worried about you? Is that left
               for me?

                          BUCKY
               No need for that.

                          KAY
               For such a cautious man you're quite a
               hardcase.

                          BUCKY
               It's just...He's done a lot for me.

     Kay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as
     if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her.

     The point is not lost on him.

     She crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Good night.

     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with
     a glass of milk and filling out the police reports.

     INT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING

     Bucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of
     Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:"The
     Black Dahlia".

     He stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through
     a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects.

                          RUSS MILLARD (O.S.)
                   (re trunk)
               Found it in storage down at the railway.
               Carbons of mash notes to sailors.
               Hundreds of 'em.

     Bucky shows him the newspaper.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Thank our friend Bevo Means at the
               Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her
               black dress like some actress in that
               Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should
               triple our confessions.

                          BUCKY
               Great.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               Hollywood will fuck you when no else
               will. What do you think?

                          BUCKY
               I think I want to go back to Warrants.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               No dice. You're a bright penny and I want
               you here.
                   (hands him a piece of paper)
               Betty's last known residences and KA's.
               Go to University Station and pick up Bill
               Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a
               tight leash, and you write the report
               because Billy's practically illiterate.

                          BUCKY
               Lieutenant--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Call me Russ and get out of here.

     Millard gestures for him to leave.

     EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER

     Bucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house.

                          BUCKY
               How do you want to play this, Sarge?

                          KOENIG
               Fritzie usually does the talking and I
               stand back up.
                   (re a leather sap in his belt)
               Muscle job?

                          BUCKY
               Let's try talk job.

     Bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on
     his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon".

     INT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER

     Bucky knocks on the door.

                          BUCKY
               Miss Saddon?

     A young woman dressed in a metallic Egyptian costume opens
     the door.

                          SHERYL
               You the driver from RKO?

                          BUCKY
               Police.

     The woman shuts the door. Seconds later the TOILET FLUSHES.
     She returns and opens it again.

                          SHERYL
               If this is about those jaywalking--

                          BUCKY
               It's about Elizabeth Short.

                          SHERYL
               I did all this on the phone this morning.
               Nine thousand questions about Betty's
               nine thousand boyfriends and I don't
               remember any of the names. Can I go now?
               The extras truck is due any minute.

                          BUCKY
               How about you sit dawn and answer my
               questions or I bust you for the reefer
               you flushed.

     She lets him in and sits defiantly.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               First question. Does a...
                   (re to his paper)
               Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live
               here?

                          SHERYL
               That's Betty's other place. DeLongpre and
               Orange.

                          BUCKY
               She moved around quite a bit. You know
               why? Was somebody threatening her?

                          SHERYL
               Betty's problem wasn't enemies. It was
               too many friends.

                          BUCKY
               I've gathered that. Let's change the
               subject.

                          SHERYL
               How 'bout "the world of high finance"?

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               How about movies? You girls are all
               tryin' to break in, right?

                          SHERYL
                   (re her extras costume)
               I'm in mister.

                          BUCKY
               Congratulations. What about Betty?

                          SHERYL
               Maybe once. Maybe not. 'Round
               Thanksgiving she showed up bragging about
               gettin' her big break...Had one of those
               viewfinders around her neck? But who
               knows where she really got it. Betty had
               a tendency to--

                          BUCKY
               ...stretch the truth?

                          SHERYL
               Lie.

     A CAR HORN HONKS. Bucky walks to the window and looks
     outside: A FLATBED TRUCK FULL OF CLEOPATRAS waits.

                          BUCKY
               Your ride's here--

     But she's already gone.

     INT. THE CAR - MOVING - HOLLYWOOD - CONTINUOUS

     They cruise to the next address.

                          KOENIG
               What'd the cooze say 'bout me?

     Bucky just stares at him; the guy's an idiot.

     EXT./INT. DELONGPRE APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

     Two men lounge on the stoop. Koenig gives them the eye as he
     passes.

     Bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again.
     Finds "M. Graham" but no Linda Martin.

                          KOENIG
               I'm bored.

                          BUCKY
               This'll just take a minute.

                          KOENIG
               I'm gonna take those two guys outside.
               Maybe they knew the cooze--

                          BUCKY
               I'll handle 'em Sarge--

                          KOENIG
               No! I'm gonna do it! (beat) Now what do I
               roust 'em about?

                          BUCKY
               I dunno. Ask 'em anything. Alibis. See if
               Betty ever engaged in prostitution...

     Koenig goes running outside. Bucky shakes his head.

     INT. A COMMUNAL SITTING ROOM - LATER

     Marjorie Graham sits on a couch with a dog-eared back issue
     of Photoplay in her hands. She's mild but well-traveled.

                          MARJORIE
               ...Betty had this gift, you see. She was
               so sweet and eager to please...a bit
               dumb, maybe. But she'd do anything to be
               liked, become whatever you wanted her to
               be. She'd walk like you, or talk like
               you...but she wasn't...she was still her.

                          BUCKY
               Did she ever tell you she was in a movie?
               Sometime around November?

                          MARJORIE
               Sure. She had this viewfinder and showed
               it around to all the guys. Said it was
               from the director. A co-starring role.

                          BUCKY
               Did she say what it was?

                          MARJORIE
               Once she said it was for Fox. Another
               time Paramount. I think she was just
               fibbing. You know, for the boys.

                          BUCKY
               Do you remember the names of any of the
               guys?

                          MARJORIE
               Don and Harold--sitting outside. She
               dated both of 'em once or twice. Other
               than that...I just...didn't really pay
               attention to who she was with.

     Marjorie looks down, fidgeting.

                          BUCKY
               What is it? You can tell me.

                          MARJORIE
               Well...Right before she moved out...l saw
               her and Linda...

                          BUCKY
               Linda Martin?

                          MARJORIE
               Yeah. Her and Linda Martin--talking to
               this older woman up on the Boulevard. She
               had a man's suit and short hair like a
               man...Only that one time...

                          BUCKY
               Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?

     Marjorie nods yes.

     Bucky's about to press her for more when Bill Koenig barges
     in, all sweaty.

                          KOENIG
               Them guys talked. Said the stiff peddled
               her twat when she got strapped bad. I
               called it in. Mr. Loew said to keep it
               zipped cuz it don't look as good.

     Bucky looks at Marjorie. Back to Koenig.

                          BUCKY
               Take their statements, Bill. I've got a
               little more here.

     Bill disappears back to the porch.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Linda Martin's room?

     INT. LINDA MARTIN'S ROOM - LATER

     Bucky pushes open the room and finds it empty. He checks the
     closet. Empty.

     Bucky runs his hand under the bed. Finds something and pulls
     it out. A small red vinyl purse. He opens the purse. Inside
     is an ID. He shows it to Marjorie.

                          MARJORIE
               That's her. God...She's only fifteen.

                          BUCKY
                   (re card)
               Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska.
               Runaway. When'd you see her last?

                          MARJORIE
               This morning. I told her I'd called the
               police to come talk to us about Betty.
               Was that the wrong thing to do?

                          BUCKY
               You couldn't have known.

     EXT. THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER

     Bucky emerges. Koenig stands on the stoop with the two men,
     both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of
     Koenig's less-than-subtle interrogation style.

                          KOENIG
                   (re the men)
               They didn't do it.

                          BUCKY
               No shit Sherlock.

     INT. AN ANONYMOUS CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapsticks come down in front of the camera: "Elizabeth
     Short...Screen Test #1."

     Elizabeth Short sits on a tiny chair in a cheap office. She's
     dressed for an audition, overly made up and nervous.

                          MAN (O.S.)
               Your name please?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Elizabeth Short. Betty. Beth...Elizabeth.

                          MAN (O.S)
               Relax, Elizabeth.

     She nods, can't relax.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Sorry. Can we try it again?

                          MAN (O.S.)
               We haven't even started yet.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Oh.

     FADE OUT.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - LATER

     Bucky fills out forms.

                          VOICE OVER
               I used a Warrant cops special prerogative
               and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka
               Linda Martin. I wrote up my day's report,
               omitting Marjorie Graham's lead on the
               old dyke. I didn't need Ellis Loew
               quashing it along with the skinny on
               Betty as the part-time prostie.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky pulls up in front of the house. Heads inside...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               To be honest, I'd pretty much overdosed
               on Betty Short's low-rent last months on
               earth and decided to kiss off the rest of
               the day and head to Lee and Kay's for a
               sandwich.

                                                            CUT TO:

     CLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

     spread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table.

     Bucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the
     photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of
     them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him:

                          KAY
               Hi, Dwight.

                          LEE
                   (wired)
               It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who
               did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the
               whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you
               took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor?

                          KAY
               Lee, Dwight's here.

                          LEE
               Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay.
               Babe's got ideas. Good stuff--

                          KAY
               This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but
               I'll give you a theory if you'll eat
               something to calm yourself down.

                          LEE
               Theory on, teach.

                          KAY
               Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were
               two killers. Because the torture cuts are
               crude, while the bisection and the cut on
               the abdomen are neat and clean...

     CLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused...

                          VOICE OVER
               Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA.
               Three days since we killed four men.

     BACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching
     Kay's eye as he goes.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too
               much.

     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER

     Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around
     the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap
     portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.

     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT

     Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT.

     HIS EYES DRIFT TO:

     A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt
     craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1",
     "Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money",
     "Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"...

     Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate
     hangers...a crude joke.

     Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot
     inside. He dials the phone:

                          BUCKY
               Administrative Vice Squad?

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - THE VALLEY - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log-
     cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters.

     INT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with
     soft girls in cashmere skirt suits.

     Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and
     slides him a whiskey.

                          BARTENDER
               Beverage Control?

                          BUCKY
                   (downing the whiskey)
               LAPD Homicide.

                          BARTENDER
               Who got snuffed?

     Bucky slides her a photo of the Dahlia and Linda Martin's ID.

                          BUCKY
               Seen either of 'em?

                          BARTENDER
               Huh. The Dahlia's a sister?

                          BUCKY
               You tell me.

                          BARTENDER
               Never seen her 'cept in the papers. And
               the little schoolgirl twist I've never
               seen. We don't truck with underaged
               stuff. Capice?

                          BUCKY
               Capice when your girls tell me that.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE BAR - SOON AFTER

     as the photos are passed from patron to patron. Aside from a
     few raised eyebrows over the Dahlia, nothing to indicate
     anyone knows anything.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER

     This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free
     whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky
     watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out
     of the ordinary.

     He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER

     A tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women
     snuggled deep into the dark corners.

     A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and
     break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar
     with the two photos. More of the same...

     He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides
     over the photos.

                          BUCKY
               Black Dahlia.

                          BARTENDER
               No shit.

     He taps a finger onto Linda Martin's ID.

                          BUCKY
               What about this girl?

     The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees
     a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates--

                          BARTENDER
               Never seen her.

     He leans over the counter.

                          BUCKY
               Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's
               fifteen fucking years old. So you come
               clean or I slap a contributing beef on
               you, and you spend the next five years
               servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in
               Tehachapi.

     The bartender looks again at the ID card.

                          BARTENDER
               A couple times. Two, three months ago.
               Just to cadge drinks off the sisters,
               though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not
               the Dahlia. Never.

     Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just
     starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute,
     change her mind and make for the door.

     A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to 
     Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out
     after the woman.

     EXT. THE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

     The woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky tails the white Packard from three car-lengths back.
     He follows her all the way from the Valley to Hancock Park.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - NIGHT

     As the woman parks her car in front of A HUGE TUDOR MANSION,

     Bucky cruises by, catching her license plate and writing it
     on a pack of matches from LaVerne's.

     In his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car, a striking
     figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the
     enormous lawn and into the home.

     EXT. A PAY PHONE - MINUTES LATER

     Bucky reads the license plate into the phone. He receives
     information back and writes it onto the matchbook, as well.

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky lies in his bed, staring at the ceiling. His bedside
     light reveals a still life: Elizabeth Short's mug shot photo
     tucked underneath the matchbook. The cover is flipped open
     and we can see written: "Madeleine Cathcart Sprague".

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MORNING

     Bucky's listening to The Dexter Gordon quartet on the radio
     when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice:

                          ANNOUNCER
               We interrupt our regular broadcast to
               bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in
               the investigation of Elizabeth Short, the
               raven-haired beauty known as the Black
               Dahlia, has been captured! Red Manley, a
               Huntington Park hardware salesman and one
               of the last men to be seen with the
               Dahlia, was captured early this morning.
               Currently being held at Hollenback
               Station--

     Bucky takes a quick left down another street.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. HOLLENBACK STATION JAIL - LATER

     Bucky runs into Lee as he enters the station.

                          LEE
               Dahlia left San Diego six days before we
               found her. Dago cops got a witness puts
               her in a tan Dodge with a partial plate
               ident. Finally got a cross-check that
               matched on Red here.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.

     Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a
     small corridor, watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY
     through a one way mirror. Manley is carrot-topped, 25, and
     scared shitless.

     Millard's soothing voice can be heard through speakers.

                          MILLARD
               Like I said, Robert. We're doing this
               because you didn't come forward.

                          RED MANLEY
               I've told it three times now. I didn't
               want my wife to know I was chipping her.

                          MILLARD
               But you said you didn't chip on her.
               Betty wouldn't put out. That's no reason
               to hide from the police.

                          RED MANLEY
               I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced
               with her. It's the same thing as
               chipping.

                          MILLARD
               And you wanted to fuck her, didn't you?

                          RED MANLEY
               I wanted...to test my loyalty to my wife.

                          MILLARD
               Come on, son!

                          RED MANLEY
               I wanted to fuck her. Yes.

                          MILLARD
               But she cock-teased you.

                          RED MANLEY
               She said she had her period--

     All of the cops outside laugh.

                          RED MANLEY
               Said the father of her child would be a
               combat veteran--

                          MILLARD
               And you were in the Army band. You get
               angry?

                          RED MANLEY
               I told you. I didn't kill her.

                          MILLARD
               You drove her back to LA with you
               on...December tenth? And dropped her at
               the Biltmore Hotel?

                          RED MANLEY
               I've told it how many ways? How many more
               ways do you went to hear it?

     Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror. He
     tugs at the knot of his tie. Soon after he slips out of the
     room and Harry Sears slips in.

     Bucky turns to Lee.

                          BUCKY
               Welcome back to earth, partner.

                          LEE
               Your fault, really. After you left Kay
               slipped me a Mickey. Slept for seventeen
               hours.

                          BUCKY
               Your fault for buying her all those
               chemistry classes.

                          LEE
               Learn anything interesting?

                          BUCKY
               No.

                          LEE
                   (re the interrogation)
               Now you'll see why Russ keeps Harry
               around.

     INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

     Harry circles Red Manley, lightly tapping a metal-studded sap
     in his hand.

                          LEE
                   (re the sap)
               Russ's only rule. No actual hitting.

     BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

     Harry leans close to Red, tapping the sap on the table. His
     stutter completely gone.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You wanted some fresh gash, and you
               thought Betty was easy. You came on
               strong and that didn't work. You offered
               her money. She told you she was on the
               rag, and that was the final straw. You
               wanted to make her bleed for real--

                          RED MANLEY
               No no no. Not Betty--

     Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it.
     Red bites down on his lip, cutting it.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You plied Betty with drinks, got her to
               talk about her old boyfriends and came on
               like a pal, like the nice little corporal
               willing to leave Betty to the real men,
               the men who saw combat--

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

     Harry SMASHES the table again.

                          HARRY SEARS
               You took her to a toolshed, maybe one of
               those abandoned warehouses out by the old
               Ford plant in Pico-Rivera. There was some
               twine and lots of cutting tools lying
               around, and you got a hard-on...

                          RED MANLEY
               No no no--

     Again Harry smashes the table. Red almost topples his chair
     backwards out of fear, only Harry's hand an the back slats
     keeping it from going over...

                          HARRY SEARS
               Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every
               girl who said "I don't suck", every time
               your mommy spanked you, every evil eye
               you got from real soldiers when you
               played your trombone in the army band.

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Goldbrick, needle-nick, pussy-whipped--

                          RED MANLEY
               No--

                          HARRY SEARS
               That's what Betty had to pay for wasn't
               it?

                          RED MANLEY
               No, please! God as my witness!

                          HARRY SEARS
               God hates liars!

     Smash!

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Tell me, Red! Tell Betty! Tell God!

                          RED MANLEY
               I didn't hurt her--

                          HARRY SEARS
               Tell God!

     Harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls
     the whole thing over onto its side.

     Red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his
     hands together--

                          RED MANLEY
               The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
               want...

     He begins to weep. Completely broken.

     Harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at
     his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby,
     juicehound face.

     He gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room.

     OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY

     Russ Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from
     the general crowd of officers.

     BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

     Bucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and
     take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a
     kindly uncle.

     OUTSIDE THE STATION

     Bucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Good report yesterday, Bleichert.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What next?

                          BUCKY
               You send me back to Warrants?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Wrong again. But keep going.

                          BUCKY
               Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red
               dropped her off there on the tenth maybe
               we can start reconstructing the last days
               before she got snatched.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky.
               Run with the ball.

                          BUCKY
               All I know is you should keep an eye on
               Loew and his boys.
               I didn't put it in my report, but Betty
               sold it outright when she needed money
               bad enough, and Loew's been trying to
               keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if
               he ever takes it to trial.

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (smiles)
               You calling your boss an evidence
               suppressor?

                          BUCKY
               And a grandstanding son of a bitch.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You're a brighter penny than I thought.
                   (hands him a sheet of paper)
               Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I
               need smart pennies to eliminate the
               phonies from the tip sheet.

                          BUCKY
               What are you gonna do?

                          MILLARD
               Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor
               son of a bitch and his minions to make
               sure they don't try to coerce a
               confession out of that innocent man in
               the holding tank.

     He pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY CANVASSING THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT

     Restaurants, bars, juke joints. Bucky interviews every drunk
     on Western and Normandie...

                          VOICE OVER
               Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I
               listened the more they talked about
               themselves, interweaving their sad tales
               with the Black Dahlia, who they actually
               believed to be a glamorous siren headed
               for Hollywood stardom...

     Bucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               It was as if they would have traded their
               own lives for a juicy front-page death.
               I decided my report would consist of two
               words: "All bullshit".

     IN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the
     steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms
     beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back
     inside.

     Bucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons
     of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the
     autopsy...all with "E. Short" typed at the top.

                          BUCKY
               Oh Jesus.

     Kay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files.

                          KAY
               It's sick and it's insane! After
               everything...And all that might happen--

                          LEE
               I need this, babe. You know it. I'll rent
               a room for the stuff but--
                   (noticing Bucky)
               You tell her Bucky. Reason with her.

                          BUCKY
               She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least
               three misdemeanors here. It's out of
               control--

     Bucky stops himself short, studying Lee's strained face.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Kay)
               I promised him a week on it. Four more
               days and it's over.

                          KAY
               Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes.

     She turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can
     make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers
     back to his car...

     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

     Bucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked
     near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile...

     Finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for
     her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her
     while she's fumbling for her keys.

                          BUCKY
               Slumming, Miss Sprague?

     She sighs, exasperated.

                          MADELEINE
               I am now. Daddy spying on me again?

     She pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very
     deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr:

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin'
               in such unsuitable places--

                          BUCKY
               I'm a policeman.

                          MADELEINE
               Well that's a new one--

     She peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it
     out. Over a hundred dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Homicide.

     He hands the money back.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin.

     All of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs
     her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Here or downtown? I know you knew her so
               don't jerk me off on that or it's
               downtown and a whole lot of publicity.

     She opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in
     next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity
     to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the
     resemblance is still there nonetheless.

                          MADELEINE
                   (gathering herself)
               This is all a fluke. I met them at
               LaVerne's last fall.
               Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple.
               She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal
               off a sister.

                          BUCKY
               You sleep with either of them?

                          MADELEINE
               No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat.

                          BUCKY
               Are you lez?

                          MADELEINE
                   (Scotchman's burr)
               Ye might say I take it where I can find
               it, laddie.

     Bucky's charmed by her, but stays focused.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you rabbit last night?

                          MADELEINE
                   (exasperated)
               Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The
               Emmett Sprague. He built half of
               Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he
               didn't build he bought. Imagine the
               headlines. "Tycoon's Daughter Questioned
               in Black Dahlia Case--Played Footsie with
               Dead Girl at Lesbian Nightclub". Get the
               picture?

                          BUCKY
               In Technicolor. (beat) What did you talk
               about?

                          MADELEINE
               Linda talked about her boring boy back in
               Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty
               talked about the latest issue of Screen
               World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine
               yards.

                          BUCKY
               Betty ever tell you about a movie she
               did? Show you a viewfinder? Anything
               specific?

                          MADELEINE
               On a conversational level they were right
               down there with you, only they were
               better looking.

                          BUCKY
               You're cute.

                          MADELEINE
               You're not. Look, I'm tired. You want to
               hear my alibi so I can end this farce and
               go home?

                          BUCKY
               That's all anyone ever wants to
               volunteer: the alibi. Go ahead.

                          MADELEINE
               My family and I were at our house in
               Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along
               with our live-in servants. If you want
               verification, call Daddy. But be discreet
               about where we met.

     She turns in the seat to face him directly.

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Don't suppose I can convince you to keep
               my name out of the papers?

                          BUCKY
               I don't need your cash if that's what
               you're saying.

     She touches his leg.

                          MADELEINE
               Ah, Laddie...'S not what I'm saying...

     He knows exactly what she's saying.

                          BUCKY
               Convince me.

                          MADELEINE
               Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. My address
               is 482 So. Muirfield.

                          BUCKY
               I know the address.

                          MADELEINE
               Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a
               gentleman.

     He starts to get out of the car.

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               One more thing--What's your name?

                          BUCKY
               Bucky Bleichert.

                          MADELEINE
               I'll try to remember.

     He pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys. As
     he walks away he lets out a deep breath, as if he'd been
     holding it the whole time...

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY

     Bucky enters and finds Lee at a desk, manning the tip phones.

                          LEE
               Yes, ma'am. I understand. A werewolf and
               Red Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red
               Manley. Yes that would be more
               efficient...

     Lee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip. Bucky
     slides into a chair across from him, brushing imaginary dust
     off of the phone in front of him.

     Lee rings off. Smiles at Bucky.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               I love tip duty.

                          BUCKY
               So...You smooth things with Kay?

                          LEE
               Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at
               the El Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week.
               Chump change if it makes her feel good.

                          BUCKY
               De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was
               thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get
               Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it--

     Lee swings away in his rotating chair, knocking over a
     wastepaper basket.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Lee--

     The phone in front of Lee rings. He snatches it--

                          LEE
               Blanchard. Homicide.

     Lee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for
     some time. Finally Bucky catches Lee's eye. Lee makes the
     "looney" sign with his finger.

     Bucky's phone rings. He picks it up.

                          BUCKY
               Bleichert. Homicide.

     The person on the other line starts rambling on. Bucky takes
     notes diligently as we

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - LATER

     Bucky's on another call. His pile of tip sheets and routing
     slips have grown. Behind him Lee pulls on his jacket and
     gives Bucky a two-fingered salute as he saunters out.

                          VOICE OVER
               I logged forty-six phone tips, about half
               of which were reasonably coherent. Lee
               left early, dodging any talk about De
               Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up
               the summary report, most of which
               concerned the numerous dead end leads,
               bogus confessions and three hundred new
               Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut
               certain of one thing:

                                                            CUT TO:

     A CLOSE UP OF THE BETTING POOL TABLE

     as Bucky drops twenty dollars on "Unsolved - pay 2 to 1".

     INT. ANOTHER CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Elizabeth Short in another dress, her hair fixed differently.
     Clapsticks come in again: "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test
     #2"

                          MAN #2 (O.S.)
               Where are you from?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Boston. Massachusetts.

                          MAN #2
               How long have you lived here?

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Two years.

                          MAN #2
               You've lost your accent.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               Well, you know, when in Rome...
                   (looks nervously into camera)
               Why? Do you want a girl with an accent?

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer.
     Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater.

                          MADELEINE
               Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has
               heard about you. He insisted you stay for
               dinner. I told him we met at that art
               exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if
               you have to pump everybody for my alibi,
               be subtle. All right?

                          BUCKY
               Sure.

     She leads him inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Thick Persian carpets, tapestries, giant rooms with a men's
     club atmosphere.

     Next to the fireplace Bucky notices A STUFFED SPANIEL with a
     yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth.

                          MADELEINE
                   (re the dog)
               That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times
               for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in
               the paper when Daddy's accountant told
               him he'd made his first million. Daddy
               wanted to consecrate the moment so he
               shot him. Here we go--

     INT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one
     stands up.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family.
               My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My
               father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha
               McConville Sprague.

     Emmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand.

                          BUCKY
               A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed the
               pants off him. Another Billy Conn you
               were.

                          BUCKY
               Thanks.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Mondo gave a good show. What ever
               happened to him?

                          BUCKY
               Died of a heroin overdose.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Too bad. Shamed his family. (beat)
               Speaking of families--

     Both Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and
     serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of
     whom look much like Madeleine.)

     Ramona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty
     resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and
     unfocused features of a booze or drug addict.

                          RAMONA
                   (trace of a slur)
               Madeleine says nice things about you.

                          MADELEINE
               Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to
               catch a nine-thirty show.

     INT. THE DINING ROOOM - LATER

     A black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds hearty
               people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates.

     Bucky smiles politely and begins eating.

                          MARTHA
               I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.

     On Emmett's nod Martha pulls out a small sketch pad.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               You're in for a cruel caricaturing,
               Bucky. Maddy's my pretty one, but
               Martha's my certified genius.

     A wince from Martha.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               What kind of name is Bleichert? Dutch?

                          BUCKY
               German.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a
               bit excessive, but mark my words that
               someday we'll regret not joining forces
               with him to fight the Reds. I killed a
               lot of your countrymen during the war.

                          MARTHA
               Did you meet Balto out in the hallway?

                          BUCKY
               Very realistic.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               An old friend stuffed him. We were in the
               Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden.
               He wanted to work in the flickers.

                          BUCKY
               So when did you come here?

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but
               the silent flickers was booming. Georgie
               got work as a lighting man, and me
               building houses.
               Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett
               and I helped him build that housing
               project he was putting up--Hollywoodland--
               underneath that godawful sign.

                          BUCKY
               I always loved the Keystone Kops.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar
               dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting
               as laborers and vice versa. I used to
               drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after
               twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker
               and put in another six hours by
               torchlight. Even gave me as assistant
               director credit a couple times, so
               grateful he was for the way I squeezed
               his slaves--

     A SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across
     the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her
     fork (the source of the sound).

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you
               like to contribute to the conversation?

     Ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily.

                          RAMONA
               Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona
               Boulevard was named after me?

                          BUCKY
               No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't.

                          RAMONA
               When Emmett married me for my father's
               money he promised my family that he would
               use his influence with the City Zoning
               Board to have a street named after me.
               But all he could manage was a dead-end
               block in a red light district in Lincoln
               Heights. Are you familiar with the
               neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert?

                          BUCKY
               I grew up there.

                          RAMONA
               Then you know that the Mexican
               prostitutes expose themselves out of
               windows to attract customers. I hear many
               of them know Mr. Sprague by name--

     Emmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky
     stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron
               comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's
               male whores. A common policeman. My God,
               Emmett. How little you think of me.

     She struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband
     follows.

                          MADELEINE
               I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                          MARTHA
                   (cheery)
               Mr. Bleichert?

     Martha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad. Bucky
     takes it as she walks away.

     ANGLE ON THE SKETCH:

     A caricature of a naked Bucky having sex with Madeleine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     A cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The
     camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11.

     INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

     A single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as Bucky
     and Madeleine fuck on the bed.

                          MADELEINE
               I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family--
               don't--they're not so bad--

     Bucky grabs her hair--

                          BUCKY
               Not them, me. Do me. Be with me.

     Focusing, Madeleine pins Bucky with her knees and pulls him
     deep into her until they're no longer common policeman and
     rich girl slut. They're one.

     INT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME

     They hold each other, sweaty and spent.

                          BUCKY
               Well. I think you kept your name out of
               the papers.

                          MADELEINE
               Until we announce the wedding?

                          BUCKY
               Your mother would love that.

                          MADELEINE
               She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the
               doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead.
               You know how Daddy really made his money?

                          BUCKY
               How?

                          MADELEINE
               He bought rotten lumber and abandoned
               movie facades from Mack Sennett and built
               houses out of them. He's got firetraps
               all over LA registered to phony
               corporations...His "good friend" George?
               Disfigured in a car crash while running
               Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him
               scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental
               property--

                          BUCKY
               You don't have to tell me this--

                          MADELEINE
               I want to. I like you Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               I like you, too.

     She looks at him earnestly.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty
               Short.

                          BUCKY
               Jesus--

                          MADELEINE
               Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just
               don't want to lie to you.

                          BUCKY
               What is it?

                          MADELEINE
               Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot.
               Straight bars. I heard about a girl who
               looked like me. I got curious and left
               notes at a couple places: "Your lookalike
               wants to meet you", things like that. I
               left my number. She called. That's how I
               met her at LaVerne's with Linda.

                          BUCKY
               And that's all of it?

                          MADELEINE
               Yes. That's all of it.

                          BUCKY
               Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty
               cops out there combing every bar in town
               looking for Dahlia info. You could be
               headed for the papers no matter what.

                          MADELEINE
               Serve my family right.

                          BUCKY
               You don't mean that.

                          MADELEINE
               No. I don't.

     He strokes her dark hair.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet
               Betty Short?

                          MADELEINE
               I've worked pretty hard to be loose and
               free. But the way people described Betty.
               It sounded like she was a natural.

                          BUCKY
               How do you mean?

                          MADELEINE
               Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from
               nothing...But then she carried nothing
               with her, either. I don't know...when
               you're rich sometimes you romanticize the
               poor...

                          BUCKY
               I wouldn't know.

     An awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. He
     studies her for a moment. Pulls her close, kisses her
     mouth...the arch of her neck...They begin to move together
     again...

     Another LAPD FORM: "Witness Report: Lorna
     Martikova...aka Linda Martin..."

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MOVING

     Bucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn...

     EXT. THE CALEDONIA LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA
     MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running.

     Bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl
     clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in
     and out of busy traffic.

     The girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses
     being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of
     the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her
     sprawling on the sidewalk.

     Bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and
     screams like a hell cat.

     He cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she
     spilled her purse.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch
               me without a matron present I'll sue you!

     He picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it
     and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN.

     Her demeanor changes instantly to fear:

                          LINDA MARTIN
                   (near tears)
               Please, mister...My...my parents.

     INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Russ, Harry and Bucky sit opposite Linda Martin. She's pretty
     and small, and about to get smaller...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               ...and you don't recall any of the names
               Betty went out with last fall?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               They were just pickups.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               No one who would do her harm?

     The girl thinks hard, shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY
               You made the casting rounds together.
               Ever get any movie work?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               No.

                          BUCKY
               So what about the film can?

     Her eyes go to the floor, tears begin to drop.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               It's...a movie.

                          BUCKY
               A dirty movie?

     She nods her head silently.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You have to tell us the whole thing,
               sweetheart. So think it through.

     Harry pours her a paper cup of water. She takes a sip.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This
               Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something
               - starting talking to me.
               I thought I was pregnant, and I was
               desperate wicked bad for money. He said
               he'd give me two hundred dollars to act
               in a nudie film.

     She takes a large gulp of water.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               He said he needed another girl so I asked
               Betty. The three of us drove down to
               Tijuana and we made the movie at this big
               house outside of town. (beat) Then he
               drove us back to LA.

     Her head bowed. Russ and Harry stare at her impassively.

                          BUCKY
               Was this around Thanksgiving?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder?

     She raises her head in recognition and nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did he seem particularly interested in
               Betty? Did she see him again?

     She shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               But you saw him again, didn't you? How
               else could you have gotten a copy?

     Linda looks sadly at Bucky.

                          LINDA MARTIN
               After Betty...After I read about
               Betty...I went looking for him in
               Gardena. He was about to go back to
               Mexico and I conned him out of a print.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Where was that?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               I don't remember. On Aviation somewhere.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Why would you do that?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought...I
               could sell it if I had to. (ashamed) It
               was...a collector's item.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               And he willingly gave you a copy of the
               film? For nothing?

                          LINDA MARTIN
               No. Not for nothing.

     She looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's
     harder and more desperate than they imagined.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               You'll let me have it back, won't you?
               You won't let people look at it?

     Now its the cops turn to look away.

     EXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER

     Russ and Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Whattya think?

                          BUCKY
               I think she's covering on the Mex angle.
               Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him
               taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The
               TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg
               Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play
               cellmate for a day.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bleichert you are a very bright penny
               today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue
               movie night at City Hall.

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER

     A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are
     present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of
     Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee.

     A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles
     into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the 
     headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released
     --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody"

                          LEE
                   (raggedy)
               Gettin' any?

     Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred
     image hits the screen. It begins to focus.

     A title: "Slave Girls From Hell"

     The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian
     hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled
     serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms
     in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each
     other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing
     only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance...

     An audible breath in the muster room.

     A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical
     object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending
     from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks
     it, eyes wide open and glassy.

     An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty
     enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's
     legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying
     her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.

     Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the
     camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch.
     Betty tonguing next to the dildo...

     BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM

     The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues...

                          CHIEF HORRALL
               Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to
               do with the girl's murder--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed
               down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play
               as the killer. But maybe he showed it to
               someone--

     Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen.

                          LEE
               Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her!
               I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room
               for less than this!

     He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the
     room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and
     sits on a bench next to him.

                          LEE
               Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. I did, partner. I did.

     Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in
     his fist. He pries it loose.

     Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants.
               You're my man, and you made me look like
               a fool in front of the two most powerful
               men in the Department. If you weren't
               Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty
               already. You've gotten personally
               involved in the Short case--

                          BUCKY
                   (holding up the newspaper)
               Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Shut up, Bleichert.
                   (back to Lee)
               You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow.
               Report to me at 0800 with letters of
               apology for Green and Horrall. For the
               sake of your pension I'd suggest you
               grovel.

                          LEE
               I want to go to TJ--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Blanchard!

     Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels.

     INT. THE SQUADRON - DAY

     Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The
     clock behind him reads "12:30". Loew approaches.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               You've been skating around all morning,
               Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to
               Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to
               check out a radio car and get out there.

                          BUCKY
               Yes, sir.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               And if you see that phantom partner of
               yours, tell him this no-show's gonna cost
               him three days pay.

     Loew walks off. Bucky dials the phone.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Hello.

                          BUCKY
               It's me. You want to get together?

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               When?

                          BUCKY
               I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Not at the house. Daddy's having a
               business soiree. The Red Arrow.

                          BUCKY
               I have an apartment, you know.

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               Room 11. Forty-five minutes.

     She hangs up.

     INT. RED ARROW MOTEL - ROOM 11 - LATER

     They lie naked in the bed. Bucky's lost in thought.

                          MADELEINE
               Smile at me. Look soft and sweet.

     He looks anything but.

                          BUCK
               They picked up Linda Martin yesterday.
               She had a stag film of her and Betty
               Short playing lez. Spooky stuff.

     Madeleine sits up.

                          MADELEINE
               Did she mention me?

                          BUCKY
               No. And I checked through the case file.
               There's no mention of that note-leaving
               number you pulled. (beat) Babe, I'm
               withholding evidence for you. It's a fair
               trade for what I'm getting, but it still
               shakes me. Is there anything you haven't
               told me about Betty and Linda?

     She runs her fingers down his ribcage, teasing his boxing
     scars.

                          MADELEINE
               Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that
               one time we met last summer. I just did
               it to see what it would be like to do it
               with someone who looked like me and--

                          BUCKY
               Jesus Christ.

     He jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay--

     He pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his
     jacket--

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Stay sugar stay--

     --and slams the door on the way out.

     INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - LATER

     Bucky steamed in the car. He flips on the police radio,
     looking for distraction. Instead he gets:

                          RADIO DISPATCHER
               Code four all units at Crenshaw and
               Stocker. Two dead, suspect dead, Raymond
               Douglas Nash, warrant number--

     EXT. A KOREAN GROCERY - MINUTES LATER

     RAYMOND NASH lies dead on the sidewalk. Off to one side, a
     short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all
     went down, pantomiming how he shot an escaping Raymond Nash.

     Bucky stands over Nash, staring at his dead features. He
     walks inside.

     INT. A KOREAN GROCERY - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky's POV:

     A robbery gone bad. A sixty-year old Korean shopowner lies
     dead behind the counter and his teenaged son lies dead in an
     aisle. Blood and green linoleum.

     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - SOON AFTER

     Bucky bursts into the squad room, seeing red.

                          BUCKY
               Blanchard!

     A cop walking through the bullpen points to the bathroom.

     INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky kicks in the door, finding Lee washing his hands in the
     sink. He holds his hands up to Bucky, blood oozes from Lee's
     knuckles.

                          LEE
               I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.

                          BUCKY
               Not good enough.

     Bucky steps into Lee with fists flying, a mad demon. He
     smashes him again and again, beating his only friend until
     Lee slides senseless to the floor...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky drinks bourbon straight, his wrist heavily bandaged.

                          VOICE OVER
               Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight got me local celebrity, Warrants,
               and close to nine grand in cash;
               winning the rematch got me a sprained
               wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the
               rest of the day off. Whoever said winning
               isn't everything got that part right.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up
     a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior
     Nash, and Bobby De Witt.

                          KAY
                   (eyes red from crying)
               We're famous, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?

                          KAY
               I haven't seen him since you beat him up.

     Bucky looks ashamed.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               I don't blame you.

     He walks to her and she holds him.

                          BUCKY
               He's in trouble, you know.

     She nods. He strokes her hair.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee
               doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over
               to stay with you.

                          KAY
               I don't want you coming over here just to
               sleep an the couch again.

                          BUCKY
               Kay. Lee--

     She holds up a hand, waving him off. She knows all this.

                          KAY
               You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To
               most people--that's the scary stuff. Not
               everything else.

     She knows him to the core. She steps back, holding his hands.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Luck.

                          BUCKY
               Short of winning?

                          KAY
               Luck.

     INT. POLICE STATION - BUCKY'S CUBICLE - LATER

     Bucky's on the phone.

                          BUCKY
               Thank you very much.

     He rings off looking very disturbed as Russ and Harry arrive.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               What happened in TJ?

                          HARRY SEARS
               Checked for the smut pad. Goose egg.
               Peddlers--double goose egg--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky. Blanchard's in Tijuana. A border
               cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch
               of rough-looking Rurales last night.

     Bucky exhales hard.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               What is it?

                          BUCKY
                   (re his phone call)
               That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt
               bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa
               depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer
               Tijuana.

     EXT. TIJUANA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAWN

     Bucky cruises the Tijuana streets: child beggars dig for 
     breakfast in trash cans, taco venders stir pots of dog-meat
     stew, sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses. Rurales
     drive prewar Chevys wearing black uniforms...

                          VOICE OVER
               Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her
               "Mex" was actually a local named Walter
               Wellington, who copped to making the film
               but quickly provided the cops his alibi
               for the Dahlia's missing days.

     Bucky parks at a big pink Art Deco hotel (The Divisidero).

     INT. THE DIVISIDERO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky badges the desk clerk and gets a room number. He heads
     upstairs.

                          VOICE OVER
               Not that this stopped Loew and his boys
               from rousting spics all over town for a
               possible Dahlia frame-up. The circus was
               becoming a farce.

     INT. A DIVISIDERO HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel, and Bill Koenig arguing.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               We can't do that! Wellington told Tierney
               he made the pic--

     Bucky opens the door and the room falls quiet.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               Bleichert.

                          BUCKY
               Lee's down here and so is Bobby De Witt.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Fuck Blanchard. He's suspended.

     Bucky charges the DA but Vogel and Koenig intercept him,
     pushing him roughly back out in the hall. Loew retreats to
     the other side of the room.

                          VOGEL
               You know what, kid? I got a soft spot in
               my heart for light heavyweights.
                   (chucks his chin)
               You promise not to hit Billy and I'll
               help you look for your partner.
                   (re Bucky's ragged appearance)
               I'll drive. You look like shit.

     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

     Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists,
     hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths
     prowling for drunks to roll...

     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS

     The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street
     and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up
     by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces.

     Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the
     children scatter, squabbling over the coins.

     IN THE BACKGROUND

     Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale
     nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock
     building.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A FILTHY MEXICAN JAIL - SOON AFTER

     Vogel and Bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty
     cells. A Mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two
     cops walk in to face

     BOBBY DEWITT

     the hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated
     well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado.

                          DEWITT
               Cops, huh? Well at least you're American.
               Never thought I'l be glad to see you
               guys.

                          VOGEL
               Why start now?

     Vogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel
     smashes him with a thick backhand across the face.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY HANDCUFFING BOBBY DEWITT TO A CHAIR

     Vogel stands over him.

                          VOGEL
               Lee Blanchard's here in TJ, and you came
               here flush out of Big Q. That's a
               goddamned strange coincidence and I don't
               like it. I don't like you and I don't
               like being down in this rat-infested
               country when I could be home with my
               family.

     DeWitt pisses his pants.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Did you know Blanchard was in TJ?

                          DEWITT
               Ain't seen Blanchard since my fuckin'
               trial.

     Vogel smashes him across the face.

                          VOGEL
               Do not use profanity with me, and address
               me as sir.

     DeWitt's head bobs up and down.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why?

                          DEWITT
               Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee
               beauty gotta be scared of me 'cause of
               how I flapped my trap at trial, but all I
               know is what I read in the papers. Maybe
               I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin'
               trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty
               killed them niggers--

     Vogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him
     back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him.

                          VOGEL
               Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant
               Blanchard but he is a fellow officer and
               I will not have syphilitic scum like you
               defaming him. Now you risked a parole
               violation for a trip down here.

     He lets go of his neck, the color returning to DeWitt's face.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Why are you here, Bobby. You tell me.

                          DEWITT
                   (a beaten dog)
               I came down to cop some heroin and move
               it back to LA. I'm meeting a guy, Felix
               Casco, at the Gardena Motel. Please.
               Don't hurt me no more. Please.

     Vogel claps his hands together, gleeful with this bonus bust.

                          VOGEL
                   (heading out of the cell)
               I'm gonna call Ellis.

     Bucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that
     Vogel's left the cell.

                          BUCKY
               Finish up with you and Blanchard.

                          DEWITT
               Sir, all that's between me and Blanchard
               is that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake--

     IN SLOW MOTION--

     Bucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and
     choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out--

     BEHIND BUCKY, VOICES IN SPANISH

     and then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards
     into the cell bars. And then

     BLACKNESS

     which slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky
     finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell.

     Refocusing on the scene:

     Two Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with
     matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet.

                          BUCKY
               How long--

                          VOGEL
               I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him
               to his pal. But he blew his tail while
               you were catching up on your beauty
               sleep, which is too bad for him.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A STUDEBAKER PATROL CAR WITH LIGHTS FLASHING

     INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER

     Vogel, Koenig, a Rurale, and Bucky (holding a piece of ice to
     the back of his head).

     The car arrives at a horseshoe-shaped auto court. Two Mexican 
     policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms.

     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     As the American cops walk in on a cordite-reeking
     slaughterhouse. Bobby De Witt and a Mexican man lay dead on
     the floor, bullet holes oozing blood all over them.

     Bucky notes the bruises on De Witt's neck from where he
     choked him. Bucky squints at the men, still a little
     disoriented...

                          VOGEL
               The spic's Felix Casco, a known dope
               trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum,
               maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I say let
               our Mexican colleagues handle their own
               dirty laundry and we go back to LA and
               find the son of a bitch who sliced the
               Dahlia.

     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Kay sits curled into a corner of the couch, defensively.
     Bucky sits on a small chair next to Lee's large easy chair.

                          KAY
               I spent the morning with Internal
               Affairs. I told them...everything I knew.
               I gave them so much...and in the end it
               didn't seem like anything at all.

                          BUCKY
               He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it.

                          KAY
               You don't know anything, Dwight. But
               that's what I like about you.

                          BUCKY
               Kay--

                          KAY
               I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth
               grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone
               now--

                          BUCKY
               He's coming back.

     She nods, mollifying him.

     much work over one girl.

     at Bucky as the two of them come simultaneously.

     As soon as it's over, she looks for his eyes. He won't look
     at her. She grabs his chin and turns him face to face.

               Maybe with a little more sadness. Can you
               give me a little more sadness?

     FADE OUT

     THE CAMERA PANS UP FROM THE BETTING SHEETS:

     "TRANSFER NOTICE...As of 2/6/47 these officers
     currently assigned to the Elizabeth Short
     investigation will return to their regular duties...

     WIDE ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky reads the list. Unfortunately his name is not on it.

     He beelines straight to

     RUSS MILLARD'S OFFICE

     the quiet man looks up from his desk.

                          BUCKY
               I wasn't on the transfer list.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I asked Jack to keep you on.

                          BUCKY
               Why?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Because you're getting to be a damn good
               Detective, Bleichert. And Harry's
               retiring in two years. Need I spell it
               out?

                          BUCKY
               No.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You been working this case pretty hard.
               Or is it the other way around?

     Bucky smiles weakly; Russ knows him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It's not as much fun once it moves to the
               back pages, is it? (changing subjects) I
               hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez
               for the Bobby De Witt murder.

                          BUCKY
               I heard that, too.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You must be relieved.

                          BUCKY
               They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he
               doesn't show up in thirty days he's out.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               He'll be found if he wants to be found.

                          BUCKY
               Like the guy who killed the Dahlia?

     Russ smiles grimly.

     EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

     Bucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers.

                          VOGEL
               Boyo! Glad you could make it.

     He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.

     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels,
     which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are
     consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's
     food taster.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               I called this little meeting for a couple
               reasons, Bucky.
               We'd both like to see the Short case
               closed out and get back to normal
               business.

     Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants
               you for his partner when he gets his
               lieutenancy, and--

                          BUCKY
               Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.

                          VOGEL
               You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is
               a sob sister, and I'm much more your type.

     Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew:

                          BUCKY
               What do you want, Ellis?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There
               are four confessors still being held at
               City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't
               coherent when they were first questioned,
               and they're all violent, frothing-at-the-
               mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated.
               It's a muscle job.

                          VOGEL
               I wanted Bill Koenig--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               But Bill's a bit too enamored with
               violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no?
               Because if it's yes, I'll make sure
               you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an
               inside track to some stripes. If not,
               it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard
               gets tired of you. We both know that Russ
               is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight.
               That could be a long time. Yes or no?

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CITY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon
     while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots.

     INSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON

     the four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The
     camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old
     and palsied.

                          VOICE OVER
               On my way over I played out their rap
               sheets in my head, trying to work up a
               head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time
               Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated
               sexual assault on minors. Between prison
               jolts he confessed to all the big sex
               crimes.

     EXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE BUILDING

     Bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street
     facade illuminated: "KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A.
     COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923"...

     THE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and
               a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums
               with some good combos. He took two
               Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught
               masturbating at the scene of his last
               torch.

     AT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING

     Fritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside.

     INT. THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     A huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the
     ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look 
     terrified.

     The camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER:

                          VOICE OVER
               Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career
               confessor specializing in copping to
               hooker homicides. His three procuring
               beefs had netted him a year county jail
               time, his phony confessions two ninety
               day observation stints at the Camarillo
               nut farm.

     And the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD:

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller,
               male prostitute, and a former San
               Bernardino County deputy sheriff.

     The group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR
     UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS.

     Bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands
     each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over
     their respective meathooks.

     Bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A
     SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws
     him over Vogel addresses the prisoners.

                          VOGEL
               You all confessed to killing the Dahlia.
               We can't prove you did, so you're gonna
               have to convince us... Query on, Bucko.

     Bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell.
     The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook
     above him to steady him.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd
               you kill her?

     Bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes.

                          VOGEL
               Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made
               little boys suck his hog.

     Bucky's hand twitches on the meathook.

                          BUCKY
               Come clean, pop.

                          BIDWELL
               I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a
               ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and
               a cot, that's all. Please, mister.

     The man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky
     moves on to Cecil Durkin.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about it, Cecil.

                          DURKIN
                   (laughing)
               You get that line from Dick Tracy or
               Gangbusters?

     Bucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring...

                          BUCKY
               One more time, shitbird. Tell me about
               you and Betty Short.

                          DURKIN
               I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your
               mama! I'm your fucking daddy!

     Bucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but
     he keeps his feet on the chair.

                          DURKIN (cont'd)
               You think you clever, don't you. You the
               bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older
               than vaudeville.

                          BUCKY
               I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in
               mind.

     This shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler.

                          ISSLER
                   (sincere)
               Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know
               why I do these things, and I apologize.
               So please don't let that man hurt me.

                          BUCKY
               Convince me.

                          ISSLER
               I...can't. I just can't.

                          BUCKY
               You're a pimp. You know Betty Short?

                          ISSLER
               No.

                          BUCKY
               Why'd you confess to her murder?

                          ISSLER
               She looked so...sweet and pretty and I
               felt so bad. I always confess to the
               pretty ones.

                          BUCKY
               You feel guilty Charlie? You hit your
               girls, get 'em high on hop?

                          ISSLER
               I do such nasty things I don't know why--

     Vogel struts over, putting on brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL
               This kid glove routine's gettin' old--

     He kicks Issler's chair out from under him, the pimp
     screaming as his wrists snap. Vogel kicks the remaining three
     chairs out, punctuating each with a declaration:

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Jack roller! Nigger! Baby fucker!

     The men scream like dying animals as Fritzie zeroes in on
     Charlie Issler. He begins punching him in the gut with the
     brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Tell me about the Dahlia's missing days
               you whoremonger! Tell me!

                          ISSLER
               I...don't...know...anything!

                          VOGEL
               Tell me what you know!

     He punches him in the crotch.

                          ISSLER
               I knew you at Ad Vice!

     Vogel ignores him, rabbit punching him, cracking one rib and
     then another--

     ON BUCKY'S FACE

     knowing this is getting out of control. He's mesmerized by A
     FIRE ALARM on the wall behind the men...

                          VOGEL
               Tell me what your girls tell you!

     Issler retches, coughing up blood. Bucky stares at the fire
     alarm as Fritz runs through his field of vision, cackling.

     Bucky refocuses on the scene as Fritzie returns, wheeling the
     sheet-covered table Bucky'd seen before. He whips off the
     sheet revealing:

     A NAKED FEMALE CORPSE, CUT IN TWO AND MADE UP TO LOOK LIKE
     THE DAHLIA.

     Vogel grabs Issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him
     down off of the meathook.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               For your cutting pleasure, Jane Doe
               number forty-three. You're all going to
               slice her, and the best slicer buys the
               ticket!

     Issler bites through his lip as Fritzie pulls out a
     switchblade and pops it open.

     Bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow-motion, the
     men with their broken wrists, the pudgy naked corpse, Fritzie
     with the knife...

     He runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever, a piercing
     bell ringing out as Bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps
     into the drunk wagon, tearing off into the night.

     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kay answers the door and finds Bucky sitting on the front
     porch, sobbing.

     She moves to him, touching him on the back of the neck, the
     stroke of her finger enough to make him stand and face her.

     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth. Mouth
     to his fingers. She undresses him. Slowly she touches him,
     easing him, bringing him back to earth, back to humanity. To
     her.

     And finally they are joined.

                                                            CUT TO:

     ANOTHER TYPEWRITTEN SHEET: "LAPD Transfer orders: Officer
     Dwight Bleichert...From: Central Warrants...To: Foot
     Patrol, Swingwatch. Central Station..."

     EXT. SKID ROW - EVENING

     Bucky picks his way through passed-out drunks and bums. He's
     back in uniform.

                          VOICE OVER
               East 5th Street from Main to Stanford.
               Blood banks, liquor stores selling half
               pints and short dogs exclusively, fifty-
               cent-a-night flophouses and derelict
               missions...

     DOWN THE STREET

     two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon. Bucky
     turns and walks the other direction, refusing to help. They
     see him and sneer.

                          VOICE OVER
               Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to
               try my word against a twenty-two year man
               and the city's future District Attorney.
               I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and
               determined to spend my shifts trying to
               be the worst foot hack in history.

     He hands a quarter to a drunk as he passes, urging him with
     his nightstick to crawl back into a bar.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Russ Millard pores over a file in their private collection.
     Bucky sits with his feet up on the bed, flipping through a
     folder...

                          VOICE OVER
               A month passed. The Dahlia leads dwindled
               to zero and every officer except Russ and
               Harry were returned to their regular
               assignments. As for me, I'd been able to
               contain my Dahlia interests within the
               walls of the El Nido.

     Bucky eyes a Dahlia photo pinned to the wall.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Still, I remembered what Madeleine said
               when I told her we were through...

     INT. THE RED ARROW MOTEL - NIGHT

     Madeleine sits on the bed fully dressed. Bucky stands in the
     doorway.

                          MADELEINE
               You'll be back. (beat) I look like her.

     Bucky turns and leaves as we

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     where Kay and Bucky sleep in bed, locked as spoons. Safe.

                          VOICE OVER
               But sometimes Betty came to me...

     INT. THE MEAT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - A DREAM

     Bucky watches Fritz Vogel beats the hell out of Charles
     Issler as he hangs off the meathook. In the background, Betty
     Short stands and screams:

                          BETTY SHORT
               Bucky! No! Stop him!
                   (crying)
               I'll do whatever you want...

                          ISSLER
               I'll be okay....Liz...

     Bucky turns and stares at her.

     CLOSE ON BUCKY'S BLAZING EYES

                          MILLARD (VO)
               Bucky. What is it?

     INT. THE EL NIDO - SAME

     as Bucky stares across the room at a picture of the Dahlia.
     Millard sits at the small desk, waiting for him to come back.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky.

     Bucky finally sees Russ again.

                          BUCKY
               You ever hear anyone refer to Betty as
               Liz? Anyone at all?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Nope.

                          BUCKY
               Issler did.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               The pimp? I thought he said he'd never
               heard of her.

                          BUCKY
               You know what else he said?

     A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

     As Vogel cracks Issler's ribs.

                          VOGEL
               What did you know about the Dahlia's
               missing days?

                          ISSLER
               I knew you at Ad Vice--

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Harry Sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through
     a large metal file cabinet. Behind him the glass door reads
     in reverse: "ADMINISTRATIVE VICE'.

                          HARRY SEARS (INTO PHONE)
               N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler. Gone.

     BACK AT THE EL NIDO - SAME

     Bucky and Russ sit in silence, thinking. They know they're
     onto something...

                          BUCKY
               Fritzie didn't give a damn about those
               other three. It was all about Issler.
               Never occurred to me before.

     Bucky gets to his feet.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Meet me back here. Late.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bright penny--

     But Bucky's already out the door.

     EXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky stakes out the dark house.

     EXT. VOGEL'S SERVICE PORCH - LATER

     Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back
     door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides
     into the house...

     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed
     door. He opens it, entering

     FRITZIE'S STUDY

     He stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing
     gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with
     pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five
     years.

     Bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and
     begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds
     surprises him:

     --carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of
     account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all 
     cross-referenced to each individual being investigated.

     A veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals..

     Bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out:

     ISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots.

                          BUCKY
               Hello, Charlie. Get lost?

     Bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of
     names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one:
     "SALLY STINSON". Beside her name a handwritten note:
     "Biltmore Hotel".

     He writes it down and moves to another list of names: "Known 
     Associates, no Prostitution Record".

     And there it is: "Betty Short".

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LATER

     Bucky bops to jazz on his radio, pumped with adrenaline.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky tears through a file as Russ watches.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down
               crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before
               a roust.

                          BUCKY
               I want him nailed.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Easy, penny. They'd have to testify
               against him first. And that's not likely
               after he burns those carbons. But this
               Issler business--why hide the Issler-
               Betty connection?

                          BUCKY
                   (finding a file)
               Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to
               somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know
               about...

     A FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE

     as Fritz beats on Charlie--

                          FRITZIE
               Tell me what you know about the Dahlia's
               missing days--

     BACK TO THE EL NIDO

     Bucky reads through a letter.

                          BUCKY
               I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of
               her phantom servicemen boyfriends:
                   (reading aloud)
               "...had drinks with a great girl, Sally
               Stinson, who thinks she way be able to
               help me get a job cocktailing..."

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Cocktailing.

                          BUCKY
               Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick
               with me...What next, padre?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me
               and Harry'll poke around.

                          BUCKY
                   (displeased)
               I want him.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You'll get him, too. But you've got to
               cool your temper. It's all patience with
               the big fish or they wriggle off.

     INT. KAY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Bucky lies awake while Kay sleeps.

                          VOICE OVER
               What kept me up that night wasn't the
               idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals,
               or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp
               to see if Betty had told him something
               about one of her johns...maybe even
               Vogel, himself...No...

     A FLASHBACK - FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel and Bucky drink cocktails and eat
     pretzels...

                          VOICE OVER
               ...what kept me up was this thought: if
               Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I
               would have overheard. Fritz was confident
               he could keep me quiet.

     Ellis and Fritz clink glasses...Smile at Bucky.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And that was an underestimation I would
               bleed him for.

     BACK IN KAY'S BED

     Her hand brushes against his cheek. He reaches for it.

     OVER THIS SCENE WE HEAR A PHONE RING AND THE FOLLOWING
     EXCHANGE.

                          BUCKY (VO)
               Hello?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North
               Havenhurst in half an hour.

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - SAME

     As Bucky hangs up the phone. Trying to look casual he sidles
     over to a desk with FRITZ VOGEL on the name plate and snags a
     photo of Fritz and Johnny off the desk...

     INT. SALLY STINSON'S APARTMENT - DAY

     A worn woman in her early thirties (SALLY STINSON) sits on a
     stack of luggage, Russ and Bucky in chairs. She wears a cheap
     kimono and too much makeup for the middle of the day.

     She holds the photo of the Vogels. Shakes out her hair and
     closes her kimono a little.

                          SALLY
               I do a lot a cops, you know. Comes with
               the territory. Charlie used to say it was
               my union dues. Keep my operator's license.

     She laughs a little, trying to loosen herself up.

                          BUCK
               Ma'am. Please get to it.

                          SALLY
               Anyway. It was a full-day job. C-Note and
               a half. Kept talkin' about givin' me "The
               Big Schnitzel"...more like a cocktail
               frank once we got down to it...Well, we
               screw the whole afternoon...Go down to
               the lobby for some dinner and there's
               Liz, sittin' by herself.

                          BUCKY
               You'd hooked with her before?

                          SALLY
               Three or four times. Conventioneers. And
               lemme tell you something, I'm pretty good
               at faking it. But Liz, she was good. A
               virtuoso, Academy Award kind of stuff--

                          BUCKY
               --She do dyke?

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky--

                          SALLY
               No. Nothing like that.

                          BUCKY
               Any porn?

                          SALLY
               No. But I bet she'd be gooood...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Ma'am.

                          SALLY (cont'd)
               Anyway, we all get to talking...Schnitzel
               takes a liking to her and Liz tells me
               she needs the dough. So I set up a trick
               within a trick...I take a breather and
               they go at it in the bedroom. A couple
               hours later Liz left.

                          BUCKY
               Did anything unusual happen?

     Sally thinks...

                          SALLY
               I think it got a little kinky. He'd
               brought a couple toys...He may
               have...whipped her a bit.

     Russ and Bucky glance at each other, remembering lashmarks at
     the autopsy.

                          BUCKY
               Did Vogel say anything about Liz? Was he
               gonna see her again? Anything?

                          SALLY
               He said...she liked the Big Schnitzel.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything else, Miss Stinson?

     Her face clouds over.

                          SALLY
               Two days...after...Liz got in all the
               papers...

     She has a hard time going on.

                          BUCKY
                   (helping her out)
               Is this when your pimp Charlie confesses?

                          SALLY
                   (composing herself)
               Yeah. Bad habit. Anyways, Fritzie V.
               shows up and shakes me hard about
               Charlie, whether he'd say anything about
               Liz to the caps. Beat me bad. Real bad.

     She lifts her head. Taps her nails on the suitcases
     underneath her.

                          BUCKY
               One last time to be sure.
                   (pointing to Fritzie's picture)
               You are sure this is the man that you
               tricked with? And tricked with Liz Short?

     A puzzled look covers her face.

                          SALLY
               No mister you got it all wrong.

                          BUCKY
               But you said--

                          SALLY
               Fritz just beat me. It was Sonny me and
               Liz did. Sonny.

     She taps her finger on John Vogel's face.

                          SALLY (cont'd)
               I'd recognize that lousy fuck anywhere.

     Off Bucky and Russ' shock we

     EXT./INT. RUSS MILLARD'S CAR - LATER

     as they cruise the streets of skid row. While Russ talks
     Bucky fills a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE with an amber liquid...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I'll be a chimp's priest, Buck. A chimp's
               priest--watch the air bubbles--I shoulda
               known that Johnny I d need a pro to lose
               his cherry...Never had 'em for a kink and
               a cherry, though...

     Bucky points out the window.

                          BUCKY
               There.

     OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK

     Johnny Vogel wrestles with two drunks, kicking at them as
     they scamper into some trash.

                          BUCKY
                   (exiting the car)
               Johnny--

     Johnny ambles over to Bucky.

                          JOHNNY VOGEL
               Whatcha doin' in civvies, Bleichert?

     Bucky drills him in the solar plexus, doubling him over. He
     grabs Vogel by the hair and slams his head into the roof of
     the car as Johnny's lights dIm...

                                                            CUT TO:

     THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR - SECONDS LATER

     as Russ Millard injects the needle into Johnny's arm.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE EL NIDO - DAY

     Johnny Vogel handcuffed to a radiator, his head bobbing back
     and forth. His eyes trying to focus on Russ and Bucky.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Pentothal's good for another couple
               hours. No way he can lie.

     Johnny's eyes drift to the pictures on the walls.

                          BUCKY
               Elizabeth Short, shitbird. Elizabeth
               fucking Short!

     Russ touches Bucky's arm, urging him to sit back.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               There's a method to this, Bucky.
                   (focusing on Johnny)
               What's your name, son?

                          JOHNNY
                   (slurring)
               You know me, loot.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Answer me anyway.

                          JOHNNY
               Vogel, John G.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               What's sixteen and fifty-two?

                          JOHNNY
               Uhmmm. Sixty-eight. Why'd you hit me
               Bleichert? I didn't do you no dirt.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Focus on January, Johnny. Your father--

                          JOHNNY
               Friedrich Vogel. Fritzie.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your
               cherry. He bought you a woman for two
               days. Is that right?

                          JOHNNY
               Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer.

     Johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               This was at the Biltmore?

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy got a good rate on the room. He
               knew the house dick...This ain't right...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz
               Short at the Biltmore, too?

                          JOHNNY
               What's her name introduced me...the
               hooer.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               And what did you and Liz do?

                          JOHNNY
               We...played horse and rider. Gave her the
               Big Schnitz.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Did you whip her?

     Johnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro...

                          JOHNNY
               Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short?

     Johnny jerks back spasmodically.

                          JOHNNY
               No no no no! I didn't kill her!

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Easy son--

                          JOHNNY
               I didn't slice her!

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It's all right...Do you know who did?
                          JOHNNY
               No! No!

     Johnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in...

                          RUSS MILLARD
               When your Daddy found out you'd been with
               her, he tried to fix things didn't he?

     Johnny nods yes.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               He found out Charlie Issler had been
               picked up and he knew Charlie had this
               confessing problem, right?

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy.
               Wanted to get Charlie released...but the
               Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue
               friend owed him a favor and got this DOA
               cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis
               Jewboy said take Bleichert.
                   (looking right at Bucky)
               Daddy said you'd do it cuz without
               Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a
               sob sister, weak sister...

     Johnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands
     like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of
     a red-hot Bucky--

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (to Bucky)
               I think you should go outside.

     EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER

     Bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by.
     Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               His statement. Signed.

     Bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               We should sit on this for a little bit.
               Until I can talk to a legal officer.

     Bucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window.

     INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Bucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man
     cries...

                          JOHNNY
               Daddy...

                          RUSS MILLARD
                   (to Bucky)
               It's the shithouse until you retire, you
               know that.

                          BUCKY
               I owe her this one.

     He squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT

     Reporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight
     of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside.

                          BUCKY
               No comment...No comment...
                   (whispering in Johnny's ear)
               Tell your Daddy I know everything.
               Including his extortion deal. Tell him
               I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow.

     He approaches the desk sergeant.

                          DESK SERGEANT
               What the hell is this?

     A flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs.

                          BUCKY
               I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is
               Officer John Vogel.

     He hands over Johnny's signed statement.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Book him.

     Another flashbulb.

     EXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER

     Bucky jogs up the steps inside.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     He dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work.

                          INTERCOM
               Officer Bleichert, go to the watch
               commander's office immediately.

     Bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat.

     INT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

     Bucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow
     stands, ignoring the salute.

                          JASTROW
               You're on two weeks vacation leave as of
               now. When you return to duty, report to
               Chief Green. He'll reassign you to
               another division.

                          BUCKY
               Why?

                          JASTROW
               Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out.
               That's why.

     All Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He
     walks outside and crosses into

     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at
     Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look
     down. Defiant.

     As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik".
     He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he
     hears applause.

     Bucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green
     clapping good-bye...

     INT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapstick: "Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4"

     She sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence.

                          MAN #4 (O.S.)
               Are you all right, Miss Short?

     She looks up, seeing the camera as if for the first time.

                          MAN #4 (cont'd)
               Why don't you just...talk.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               What do you mean?

                          MAN #4
               Put the sides down. Just...talk to me.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               What would you like to talk about?

                          MAN #4
               I don't know...Anything...Do you have a
               boyfriend?

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

     Kay and Bucky sit on a bench, looking out at the water.

                          KAY
               I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to
               Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San
               Francisco...

                          BUCKY
               Kay.

                          FAY
               You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know
               you won't believe me. But you've more
               than repaid him already.

     He looks at her and she knows it's useless.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               When?

                          BUCKY
               First thing.

     She takes his hand.

                          KAY
               You're a fool, Dwight.

     EXT. THE SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - LATE MORNING

     as Bucky crosses the border into Mexico.

                          VOICE OVER
               I closed out my glory days the only way I
               knew how--I chased the gone man.

     EXT. TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     Bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals, flashing both
     his badge and snapshots of Lee.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY AND AN ENTOURAGE OF TRAILING LOCALS

     as Bucky tries to shake them, pulling out his pockets to show
     them he has no more coins.

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY QUESTIONING TIJUANA COPS

     graduating from small change to one dollar bills. Same of
     them seem to have stories to tell.

                          VOICE OVER
               I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and
               a strange series of tales that rang true.
               One had "el blanco explosivo" beating the
               shit out of three jack rollers, then
               buying off the cops with double-saws
               peeled from a large roll.
               Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a
               leper ministry priest and then driving to
               Ensenada.

     EXT - THE COASTAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

     as Bucky drives South, passing a sign which says "ENSENADA
     60 MI."

     He passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the
     road. They carry suitcases and head North.

     EXT. THE COAST ROAD - NEAR ENSENADA

     Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed
     north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every
     fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern.

     EXT. THE CITY LIMITS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

     Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown
     he's ever seen:

     Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the
     northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to
     their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags
     of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers
     attached to their belts.

     Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless
     with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.

                          VOICE OVER
               I decided it would be wise to check in
               with the law before going out to question
               the Ensenada citizenry.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Bucky stands outside a converted church with the word POLICIA
     painted in black over religious scenes.

     INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance
     hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved
     cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins.

     Bucky slides the Rurale at the desk his badge and a dollar.
     The man saunters off down the hall.

     INT. THE POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

     as Bucky is escorted in. The man sitting behind the desk
     looks up. In flawless English:

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               Officer Bleichert. Come in, please. I'm
               Captain Vasquez. How can I help you?

     Bucky exchanges his badge for a photo of Lee.

                          BUCKY
               This man's LAPD. He's been missing in
               Mexico since January. He was last seen
               headed here.

     Vasquez studies the photo. Bucky senses a twitch...

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               No. I'm afraid not. I'll ask my men,
               however. Staying the night?

                          BUCKY
               At least.

                          VASQUEZ
               Are you here alone?

                          BUCKY
               I have two partners waiting for me in
               Tijuana.

     Vasquez nods, hard to know if he believes Bucky any more than
     Bucky believes him.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               If you don't mind I'll check back in the
               morning.

                          CAPTAIN VASQUEZ
               Please.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. A FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM - LATER

     Bucky squeezes a bit of brown water onto a handkerchief and
     wipes his brow off. He kicks his travel bag underneath the
     bed and heads out.

     EXT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit-glues them to
     the door jamb.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT

     Garish neon, military personnel. Brownshirts packing serious
     weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order.

     HIS POV: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign: "CLUB BOXEO".
     Bucky goes inside.

     INT. THE CLUB BOXEO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky finds a brightly lit room filled with sailors and half-
     dressed Mexican strippers. He stands on his tip-toes trying
     to see over the crowd to find somebody with the air of
     proprietor.

     Cn a far wall: boxing publicity stills. He wanders over.

     CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS:

     A row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky. 
     Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They
     all look so young...So good...

     An old voice in English breaks his reverie:

                          OLD MAN
               Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then
               you. Who's next? Willie Pep?

     Bucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man.

                          BUCKY
               Blanchard? You've seen him? When?

                          OLD MAN
               Couple months ago. Heavy rains in
               February. Musta talked fights for ten
               hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks
               the feathers are the best division? me,
               it's the middies for sure. La Motta,
               Graziano--

                          BUCKY
               Is he still in town?

                          OLD MAN
               Don't think so. I own this place. He
               ain't been back. You lookin' for a
               rematch?

                          BUCKY
               I'm looking to get him out of a shitload
               of trouble.

     The old pug looks him up and down.

                          OLD MAN
               Well. I'll tell ya the little I know.
               Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club
               Satan, had to bribe his way out big with
               Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook.
               Tell him I said to be kosher with you.

                          BUCKY
               Thank you.

                          OLD MAN
               You ain't been in there.

     INT. CLUB SATAN - LATER

     Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The
     bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate
     while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow
     jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the
     bandstand.

     Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman
     on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns
     pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken
     servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!"

     Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman.

                          OLD WOMAN
               You wan' the bar, handsome? Breakfast of
               champions, one dollar. Round the world,
               two dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Ernie. I need to see Ernie.

                          OLD WOMAN
               Vamanos!

     And grabs him by the arm...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     ERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge
     vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo.

                          BUCKY
               I heard this man gave you some trouble a
               while back.

                          ERNIE
               Who wants to know?

     Bucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun.

                          ERNIE
               You his friend?

                          BUCKY
               He's my best friend.

     The chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting.

                          ERNIE
               Your friend drink fourteen shots of my
               best Mescal, a house record. That I like.
               He make toasts to dead women. That I don't
               mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey
               show, and that I don't take.

                          BUCKY
               What happened?

                          ERNIE
               Four of my guys he take, the fifth he
               don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it
               off.

                          BUCKY
               That's it?

     Ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and
     scratches the back of his neck with it.

                          ERNIE
               Finito.

     EXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER

     Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through
     the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple
     Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him.

     He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street,
     breaking into a slow jog.

     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER

     Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them.

     INT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER

     Bucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and
     down the door jamb. The hairs are gone.

     With one swift kick he breaks down the door.

     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

     A white man stands with his hands raised.

                          MAN
               Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend--

     Bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He
     frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed.

                          MAN (cont'd)
               Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and
               a licensed private dick. I got seventy
               bucks in there but that money's jackshit
               compared to what Blanchard was holding.
               You go partners with me and it's easy
               street--

     Bucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor.

                          BUCKY
               You tell me all of it and you watch what
               you say about my partner, or it's a B&E
               roust and the Ensenada jail.

     Dolphine pulls himself up.

                          DOLPHINE
               You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew
               to follow you? He's got a vested interest
               in you not finding out about Blanchard.

     Bucky eyes the door.

                          BUCKY
               Does he know I'm staying here?

                          DOLPHINE
               No.

     Bucky steps back from Dolphine.

                          BUCKY
               So. Let's hear it.

                          DOLPHINE
               About a month ago this Mexican woman
               shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby,
               ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the
               nines. Offers me five hundred to find
               Blanchard. Just like you I track him here
               where he's playing the rich gringo--

     A FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR

                          DOLPHINE
               I even see him beat up two spics who
               insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by
               and do nothing. So I know he's paying
               protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I
               hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale
               to snuff a coupla guys in TJ--

     A FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY...

                          DOLPHINE
               I leave a message in Dago for the woman
               tellin' her what I know...

                          BUCKY
               What's her name?

                          DOLPHINE
               Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a
               phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos
               and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge
               on Blanchard for offin' Felix.

     Bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This
     is hitting him hard.

                          BUCKY
               Go on.

                          DOLPHINE
               I come back to Ensenada on my own,
               thinking about all that cash he was
               flashing.

     Bucky's jaw clenches.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               You wanna hear this?

                          BUCKY
               Go on.

                          DOLPHINE
               Blanchard's dead. Bullet in the cabeza.
               (beat) Rumor is they never found any
               money.

     Bucky's head begins to reel...

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Maybe the Rurales. Maybe that woman or
               friends of hers. Who knows? I figured
               Blanchard was rogue, figured someone like
               you'd come lookin' for him. Maybe have a
               line on where the cash was. You knew
               Blanchard, maybe we can--

     Bucky backhands Dolphine hard, knocking him off the chair.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Look I didn't know it was personal! Don't
               hit me again--

     Bucky has his gun out, leveled at Dolphine.

                          BUCKY
               Prove it to me. Prove it!

     EXT. THE BACKROADS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT

     Dolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him.

     They come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff
     overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the
     spot.

                          DOLPHINE
               The locals keep the damn thing lit up.
               They got a lotta missing relatives.

                          BUCKY
               You got a shovel?

                          DOLPHINE
               Gardening tools--

                          BUCKY
               Good enough.

     EXT. THE BLUFF - LATER

     Bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a
     rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a
     filthy American flag in the sand.

                          DOLPHINE
               Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND

     as Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch
     of the shovel hitting bone.

     Bucky terrified to look but has to know--

     --a white jumper--

                          DOLPHINE
               Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor...

     Bucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on,
     pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he
     sand.

     Bucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his
     waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the
     thump of something solid.

     And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and
     stitch scars on the eyebrows.

     Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.

     And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming
     for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse,
     knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
     of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine
     and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...

     EXT. KAY'S HOUSE - DAWN

     Bucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying
     not to make any noise.

     The sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he
     watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand
     still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back...

     Finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into
     the house.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     A LAPD CHAPLAIN READING SOLEMNLY FROM A BIBLE

     But as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues
     standing next to Kay in a wedding dress.

     EXT. THE BACKYARD OF KAY'S HOUSE

     Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests.

                          VOICE OVER
               Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because
               their shack job was against department
               regs, but because the ghosts of their
               past had forced them to choose between
               love and passion, the veneer of a "fairy
               tale" only a band-aid for a fractured
               life.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     LEE AND KAY DANCING TOGETHER

     as Harry and Russ drink from a punch bowl...

                          VOICE OVER
               Our true vows were made in private; bury
               the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay
               said, "bury that fucking girl"...

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: "Officer Dwight
     Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation
     Detail"

     INT. THE LAPD SCIENCE LAB - DAY

     Bucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper
     and a test tube. Meticulous and boring.

     News radio plays in the background...

     A Detective pokes his head in:

                          DETECTIVE
               Bleichert? You got those prints for me?

     Bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him. The
     nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Thanks. We gotta hot one I think.

     Bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk. The radio:

                          ANNOUNCER
               ...results in the 1948 Republican primary
               are final...John Dougdale trouncing D.A.
               Ellis Loew 64% to 36%...In county
               primaries...

     This gets a smile from Bucky as he returns to his test tubes
     and beakers.

     INT. AN APARTMENT - CRIME SCENE - DAY

     Detectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects
     latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any
     attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of
     purgatory.

     INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING

     Bucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She
     absently strokes his free hand.

     Bucky intently reads the front page.

     The headline reads: "CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM
     BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION".

     Underneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in
     front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign.

     He's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo.

                          KAY
               That reminds me of something, Dwight.

     Bucky tries to hide his panic.

                          BUCKY
               What?

                          KAY
               Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think
               you could fix it?

                          BUCKY
                   (relieved)
               Sure, babe.

     The phone rings. Bucky answers it.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Hello...Hey Vic...

     Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot
               suicide.

                          KAY
               Sounds lovely. Where is it?

                          BUCKY
               Hancock Park.

     EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING

     Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a 
     technician's canvas bag.

     An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.

                          WOMAN
               Yes?

                          BUCKY
               I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express
               my condolences, Mrs.--

                          WOMAN
               Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted.
               You're the lab man?

     He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               It's the study in back of the dining
               room. You'll see the police rope. If
               you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden.

     He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.

     INT. THE STUDY - MORNING

     Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large
     desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE
     OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN.

     Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains
     decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.

                                                            CUT TO:

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes
     tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent
     prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag.

     INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards
     the main foyer. He stops short.

     ON THE OPPOSING WALL

     hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young
     boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and 
     hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks
     like one continuous deep scar.

     It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound.

     Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby
     family photos--two young women linked arm in arm.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               The other survivors. Pretty aren't they?

     She arrives next to him, dusty with soil.

                          BUCKY
               Like their mother. How old are they?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you
               finished in the study?

                          BUCKY
               Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use
               pure ammonia...
                   (looking at the two girls)
               Mrs. Chambers--

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Jane.

                          BUCKY
               Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha
               Sprague? The next block over?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
                   (snorts)
               Those girls and that family. How do you
               know them?

                          BUCKY
               I did a little work for them once.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Consider it lucky if it was a brief
               encounter.

                          BUCKY
               How do you mean?

     The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Back to condolences. Thank you for being
               so nice, Mr.--

                          BUCKY
               Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Good-bye.

     INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER

     Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in.

                          VIC
               You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about
               the husband?

                          VIC
               Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was
               depressed, failing health. The terrible
               burden of all that money'll get you every
               time.

                          BUCKY
               Wonder how he made it?

                          VIC
               No mystery there. Real estate.

                          BUCKY
               Oh really?

     INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING

     The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag
     and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a
     large box open on the work bench.

     INSIDE THE BOX

     Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO
     ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and
     photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS.

     It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his
     high school sweetheart.

     OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO:

     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

     "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5"

     She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera.

                          ELIZABETH SHORT
               ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand.
               He was in a tank battalion. A Commander.
               He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the
               deep water you see from a fishing boat...

     She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a
     scene, her real life, or just a sad lie...

     THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into
     the driveway. He covers it back up.

                          KAY
                   (getting out)
               What're you doing?

                          BUCKY
               I'm...looking for the hammer.

     She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain
     view.

     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to
     him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks.

     He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He
     squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace
     the board when something under the floor catches his eye.

     He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED
     DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS.

     He spies another scrap of paper in the hole...

     INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Kay pours two scotches.

                          KAY
               Dwight?

     She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight
     sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in
     cash.

     He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard-
     Citizens Bank..."

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it.

     THE BOULEVARD-CITIZENS BANK HEIST - A FLASHBACK

     A SHOTGUN BLAST shatters the back window of the armored
     truck. In the front seat, LEE BLANCHARD ducks down as the
     driver hits the gas...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky leans back against the bed.

                          BUCKY
               Were you ever going to tell me?

                          KAY
               He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel.
               (beat) He wanted to give me a home.

     A FLASHBACK - LEE'S CAR

     Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners...

                          LEE
               ...said I'd get a shot at Joe Louis if
               I'd take two dives for him. I said no...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light...

                          BUCKY
               Were you ever going to tell me?

                          KAY
               He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How
               he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to
               his friends...

     INT. DEWITT'S APARTMENT - A FLASHBACK

     as Lee plants the incriminating bank bags in DeWitt's closet...

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     Bucky staring back into the hole in the floor...

                          KAY
               ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job.
               He and Lee, they never even met. After
               Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured
               framing Bobby'd give me a way out...

     EXT. DEWITT'S TRIAL - FLASHBACK

     Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.

     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on
     his shoulder...

                          KAY
               Then last year...the fourth man--the
               driver--he heard Bobby was getting
               paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt
               that Lee framed him. He wanted money we
               didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.

                          BUCKY
               Ever. Were you ever...?

                          KAY
               Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.
               Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't
               matter anymore. Not to us.

                          BUCKY
               Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell
               me!

     He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it.

                          KAY
               Baxter Fitch.

     EXT. THE STREET - A FLASHBACK

     Three black man and a white man get rousted by Lee and Bucky.

                          BAXTER FITCH
               Blanchard?

     Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two
     others...

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     on Bucky's anguished face:

                          KAY (cont'd)
               He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him
               everything else. But don't forgive him
               for that. Ever.

     She reaches for his face and he pulls away.

     SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...

     as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor,
     into the blackness...

     WE FADE UP TO:

     INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg.

                          VOICE OVER
               Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch.
               Bank robber and his best friend the
               bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge.
               Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.

     He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left
     hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red
     from crying.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I
               thought I'd forgive Kay her role in
               keeping it from me. But the basic rule of
               Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried
               forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays
               buried forever. Nothing.

     Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY

     Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               So. What brings you around again?
               Considering a courtin' the old rich
               widow?

                          BUCKY
               You're not that old. And you're not very
               widowed.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You either are or you aren't.

                          BUCKY
               You seem to be doing all right.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it.
               We weren't that close anymore...You married?

                          BUCKY
               Little over a year.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there?

     Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Sorry.

                          BUCKY
               So how well do you know the Spragues?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They
               served on the California real estate
               board together. But Emmett was a bit of a
               crook. My husband got him kicked off the
               board for building dangerous buildings
               under phony corporations.

                          BUCKY
               Your husband sounds like a good man.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               He had his moments. Most of it was out of
               guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.
               When he learned he had cancer, he really
               started feeling guilty. He voted
               Democratic last year. Even went in and
               had meetings with the City Council. I'm
               sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.

                          BUCKY
               I read an article in the paper.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Same day Eldridge killed himself.
               Apropos, I guess.

                          BUCKY
               Maybe your husband--

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               My husband was rich and did a mean
               Charleston. I loved him until I found out
               he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting
               to love him again. How strange.

                          BUCKY
               It's not so strange.

     They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A
     strange emotional peace.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You're very accepting of other people's
               frailties. You're young. You should have
               illusions.

                          BUCKY
               I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard
               issue.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               So how'd a cop get mixed up with
               Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I
               assume?

     Bucky's gut clenches.

                          BUCKY
               I stopped her at a red light. One thing
               led to another. Why do you assume it was
               Madeleine?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a
               roundheels. Always has been.

                          BUCKY
               Jane. Don't be catty.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure.
               She probably inherited it from her
               mother.

     Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced
     tea. The visit is over.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You figure out the rest, officer.

     He follows her back inside.

     INT. THE HALLWAY - SAME

     As they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting.

                          BUCKY
               God that is spooky.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my
               birthday a couple years ago. I hate it.
               Want to take it with you?

                          BUCKY
               No thanks.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               Thank you, then. You were my best
               condoler.

                          BUCKY
               And you mine.

     Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake.

     EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER

     Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He
     slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to
     discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.

     We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to
     night...

     And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the
     shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She
     watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him.
     She decides not to and leaves.

     The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes...

     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING

     Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as
     Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box.
     Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...

     INT. CRIME LAB - DAY

     Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen
     burner.

     EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING

     Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.

     ACROSS THE STREET

     Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky
     guns his car to follow...

     EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

     Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot.
     He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out
     of her car he is staggered:

     It's ELIZABETH SHORT.

     Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like
     the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black
     dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides
     into the bar...

     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT

     Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is
     already taking place.

     Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her.
     Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost
     on anybody.
     Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals
     for a drink.

     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

     Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into
     a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs
     his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him
     out of the bar.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier
     loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the
     office with the key and lets the two of them in.

     He watches as the light goes on; and then off.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER

     Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him.

                          KAY
               Dwight--

     He moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he
     can.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Dwight--

     He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down
     her neck and her breasts.

     She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into
     her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him,
     hoping to catch up with his lust.

     She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to
     cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection.

     It doesn't work...

     INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bucky sits at Thad Green's desk, penitent.

                          THAD GREEN
               SID's not a bad beat, Bucky. At the time
               it was better than you deserved.

     Bucky nods.

                          THAD GREEN (cont'd)
               The blues hate you, Bucky. Vogel was
               their pal. I do this for you, you better
               be fucking supercop.

     Bucky just sits silent.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER ORDER: "Transfer order...Officer
     Bleichert...From SID...to Newton Street Division,
     Nightwatch.

     EXT. NEWTON STREET - MIDNIGHT

     Bucky back in uniform again. This time, the black slums.
     Heroin hookers, hard-core dealers, gangs.

                          VOICE OVER
               Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks
               carried metal-studded saps; squadroom
               dicks packed .45 automatics loaded with
               unregulation dum-dums.

     INT. A LIQUOR STORE DOORWAY - NIGHT

     Bucky and a large black man come tumbling out of the liquor
     store throwing vicious punches at each other.

     Bucky takes three to land six, eventually knocking the guy
     out. He looks across the street to see to cops watching him,
     measuring him.

     INT. AN ALLEY - NIGHT

     As Bucky chases two men towards a chain link fence at the end
     of the alley. One of them gets to the fence and scrambles up
     it. Bucky yanks the other one off the fence, slamming him to
     the ground.

                          VOICE OVER
               Kay. Lee. Madeleine. Betty Short. For one
               month I escaped them all.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As Kay sleeps alone in the bed.

                          VOICE OVER
               A fucking supercop.

     INT. A JAZZ BAR - EARLY MORNING

     Bucky sits in his uniform listening to a jazz quartet.

     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

     Bucky sleeps on the couch as Kay leaves for work.

                          VOICE OVER
               I escaped them all. Almost.

     EXT. A STREET CORNER - NIGHT

     Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to
     music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the
     corner, waving at cars.

     A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling
     around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him
     to beat it.

     INSIDE THE PATROL CAR

     Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him.
     Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.

     The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.

     And suddenly Bucky snaps, jumping from his car. In three big
     strides he's on the bum, clobbering him with roundhouse lefts
     and rights.

     The women are screaming. The drunk is screaming.

                          OLD DRUNK
               Pleease!

     Bucky drops him, staggering into a phone booth. He drops a
     nickel in the phone. Dials a number. Ring. Ring. Ring...

     He hangs up. Dials another. A woman's voice answers.

                          BUCKY
               It's me.

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky's just onto the porch steps when Madeleine answers the
     door. She's dressed like the Dahlia.

     He pushes her inside.

                          VOICE OVER
               It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old
               rutters who knew they'd never have it as
               good with anyone else...
               Afterwards we'd talk through the night.
               The Spragues...Crazy Papa Bleichert...

     INT. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     Sixth graders write in silence. Kay sits at her desk, sadness
     in her eyes as she watches the children.

                          VOICE OVER
               Mostly, though we'd talk about Betty. Her
               utter malleability, a chameleon eager to
               please anybody...and the disrupter of
               every life close to me...It would last a
               month.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

     Bucky stands in the living room, examining family photos. A
     photo of two young, proud WWI vets: George Tilden and Emmett 
     Sprague...A photo of the dark-haired Ramona and the ruddy and
     fair-haired Emmett...Photos of Madeleine and Martha, the
     brunette and the ruddy blond...Back to the first photo:
     George Tilden's dark hair.

     Madeleine wanders in, Bucky smiles at her.

                          MADELEINE
               What?

                          BUCKY
               Nothing.

     She runs her hands over his shoulders.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I thought the family came back from
               Laguna this week.

                          MADELEINE
                   (her Scottish brogue)
               You miss 'em, laddie? Mother's insults?
               Martha's pornography...

                          BUCKY
               Your father's Georgie Tilden war stories?

     He scans her for a reaction. If she has one it ripples
     through her almost undetectable. Almost.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - LATER

     As Bucky cruises by, grinning. He salutes the house.

                          VOICE OVER
               In the scheme of things it wasn't much.
               Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. BUCKY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     as he drives onto his own modest street.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               But combine it with banging Madeleine in
               all twenty-two rooms of their mansion, it
               was good enough for me.

     EXT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - DAY

     A moving van in the driveway and Kay's Plymouth stuffed with
     boxes. Bucky double-parks and bolts up the steps.

     The van pulls away behind him.

                          BUCKY
                   (to the van driver)
               Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!

     The van driver ignores him; Bucky turns as Kay walks out onto
     the porch.

                          KAY
               I didn't touch your things. You can have
               the furniture.

                          BUCKY
               Babe--

                          KAY
               Did you think I'd let my husband
               disappear for three weeks and do nothing
               about it? I've had detectives following
               you, Dwight. Detectives. She looks like
               that fucking dead girl, so you can have
               her--not me.

                          BUCKY
               Babe. Goddammit.

     He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range.

                          KAY
               Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.

     She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns
     the engine and disappears.

     INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

     Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing
     the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half
     the record collection gone, no candlesticks.

     He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it
     at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass
     cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window.

     IN THE BEDROOM

     Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed.

     IN THE BATHROOM

     he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with
     one blow...

     In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky
     demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the
     closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so
     scavengers can pick the place clean...

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall.
     Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the
     Black Dahlia.

     A collage of photos and file folders...

                          VOICE OVER
               It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye
               Bleichert at the bus stop, adios
               shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool
               pigeon harness bull.

     EXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT

     Bucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon
     to anyone who would do him harm.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               You traded a good woman for skunk pussy,
               you've turned everything that's been
               handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your
               "I will's" amount to the eighth round at
               the Academy gym when you stepped into a
               Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into
               clover that you turned into horse dung.

     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION

     No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the
     couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she
     reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings.
     Not sexy. Empty and resigned.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were
               a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't
               meet before 39th and Norton, it just
               might have worked. Maybe us would've been
               the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up
               past redemption...

     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER

     An apartment complex has been erected at the murder site.

     EXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

     ANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign
     changes, the "D" dropping off the end. It now reads
     "HOLLYWOODLAN".

     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY

     Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on
     a working class residential street. He stares across at a
     modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize
     it hopefully; we've been here before.

     EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky
     peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk.

     He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to
     his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the
     Victorian house and rings the bell.

     EXT. THE PORCH - SAME

     Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical
     twin to Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue.

                          GIRL
                   (Boston accent)
               Can I help you? (no response). Great.
               Take a hike you big sicko--

                          BUCKY
               Wait--

     She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it
     back open.

     Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father.

                          CLEO SHORT
               It's all right, dear. I know this pug.

     INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER

     The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look-
     a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo.

     Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo,
     who, while five years older, looks much better than last time
     Bucky saw him.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Came into a little change a while back,
               managed to trade in that shit shack out
               back for these digs. (beat) And I don't
               give a fuck what you think, you and your
               partner ain't much to look at now. I read
               the papers.

     Bucky can't deny that.

     The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky
     checks her out again. Cleo knows why.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               My youngest, Christine.

     He squeezes her hand affectionately.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook
               a damn, though.
               Got her sister's star-eyes for the
               pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's
               gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield.
               Get out of here, Chrissie...

     She rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the
     porch.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know.
               Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to
               snap a shot of the goddamn garage back
               there. Thought maybe they'd find one of
               Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals.

                          BUCKY
               You didn't move far.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat)
               Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't
               smart enough to solve the case, and you
               ain't dumb enough to still think I did
               it...I had an alibi.

                          BUCKY
               Tighter'n a popcorn fart.

                          CLEO SHORT
               And that's air tight, mug. Air tight.

     Bucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha.
               That's a plug nickel you can't spend,
               ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that
               to a fella. Especially someone like you.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               Like I said, I know you mug.

                          BUCKY
               I just thought...Maybe after all this
               time...There's something you might have
               forgot...Anything she might have said...

     Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for
     the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost
     looking like a father who'd lost a daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT
               She was a terrible actress. I'm sure
               folks've told you that. She'd practice in
               front of the john mirror.
               Once or twice she got me in on
               it...Reading parts with her for some
               audition. She stunk. Even a parent could
               tell. What Beth was good at was writing.
               All her teachers used to say that. Not
               that a grease like me'd know the
               difference. Maybe she coulda written for
               the pictures. But she wanted to be an
               actress like every other silly girl.

     His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Your folks still alive?

                          BUCKY
               My father.

                          CLEO SHORT
                   (poking)
               He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or
               maybe he thought you'd end up champ?

     Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Your momma?

                          BUCKY
               She killed herself a long time ago.

     Cleo takes a swig of his beer.

                          CLEO SHORT
               Probably better off then.

     INT./EXT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy
     of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett
     Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign...

                          BUCKY
               Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if--

                          CLEO SHORT
               Get a life, Bleichert. Don't dream it all
               away. Dreamin'll kill ya.
                   (to Christine)
               You, too. Get me a sandwich.

     He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's
     hands.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Clean up some dog shit with this for me,
               willya?

     The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with
     it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short
     watches him go.

     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - HOLLYWOOD - DUSK

     Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the 
     Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing
     the event on film.

     His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next 
     to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett
     revival:

     A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of
     the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the
     Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"

     Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering
     huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between 
     pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall
     inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.

     Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda
     Martin/Betty Short porn film.

     Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The
     light is green.

     He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. THE ADMIRAL THEATER - SOON AFTER

     Bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads MACK
     SENNETT REVIVAL".

     INT. THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

     A Keystone Kop short in progress. Bucky can barely sit down
     to watch...

                          VOICE OVER
               I tried to keep calm. I told myself that
               just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack
               Sennett build sets in the twenties didn't
               mean he had anything to do with a smut
               film twenty-five years later.

     And there's a shot of the porn set--the Keystone Kops running
     around in it like they're solving at crime back in ancient
     Egypt.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Duke Wellington had admitted making it.
               Linda Martin had said it was shot in
               Mexico.

     The short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn
     set. The credits begin to roll: "Director--Mack Sennett.
     Scenarist--Mack Sennett. Assistant Director--Emmett
     Sprague"

     On Bucky's face as one last piece of information hits him:
     "Filmed in Hollywood, USA."

     EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER

     as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the
     Hollywood hill catching his attention.

     INT. A FLASHBACK - THE SPRAGUE HOUSE

     Bucky at dinner with the Spragues.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Mack Sennett? Helped him build that
               housing project he was putting up--
               Hollywoodland--

     BACK TO THE SCENE

     as Bucky stares up at the sign.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Bucky tears through it, pulling out files. The door opens -
     it's Russ Millard.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               I got your message, Bucky.

                          BUCKY
               Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I--

                          RUSS MILLARD
               It?

     Bucky whirls around, gesturing to the room--

                          BUCKY
               Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's
               just...

     Bucky flops onto the bed, almost frantic.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Calm down, son. Tell me.

     Bucky meets his eyes: forgive me my sins.

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - NIGHT

     Bucky drives with Russ in the car next to him.

                          VOICE OVER
               I told him everything. Me and Madeleine,
               the Spragues. Withholding evidence for
               her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of
               it he only had one thing to say:

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

     On Russ:

                          RUSS MILLARD
               All right, then. It's your ball. What do
               you wanna do?

                          BUCKY
               I want to search every fucking inch of
               every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague
               property if it takes the rest of my
               shitty career. And I know exactly where
               we start.

     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT

     as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in
     Beachwood Canyon. The sign looms high above them as the "A"
     is taken dawn.

                          VOICE OVER
               Between my time with Madeleine and the
               local boom baron expose in the papers, I
               was practically an expert on Emmett
               Sprague's land deals...

     EXT. A PARK AREA AT THE NORTH END OF BEACHWOOD DRIVE

     A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being
     torn down.

     Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue
     doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into
     the woods.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               For the first time since the beginning of
               the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to
               figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.
               Instead, I focused on where.

     EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT

     Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like
     two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.

     In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
     out and the door hanging off its hinges.

                          VOICE OVER
               And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't
               have to look any further than one of
               Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One
               that was isolated...abandoned...

     They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.

     EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER

     Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it
     deeper into the night...

                          VOICE OVER
               ...and most importantly, close to a water
               source...where one could drain a body of
               its blood.

     Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see

     THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW

     teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors
     hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
     leer.

     Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They
     pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
     step into the abandoned house.

     INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME

     A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a
     bicycle tire, rags.

     They move through the house, each roam, each closet and
     corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing.

     From the kitchen:

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Bucky.

     Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off.
     Through the empty window they see:

     AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open.

     You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they
     step inside...

     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

     They know something bad happened here...

     Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking
     stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the
     corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books,
     including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man 
     Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               God help her.

     Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his
     SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his
     forensic kit.

     He opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder,
     tweezers, etc.

                          BUCKY
                   (throwing Russ gloves)
               Box up the books and papers. Maybe light
               that lantern.

     Russ grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a
     pair of gloves.

     A GRUESOME MONTAGE

     1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube.

     2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it
     very intense.

     3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed
     from the caked blood on the mattress.

     4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of
     rope...

     5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a
     piece of paper.

     6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good
     prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the
     head of the mattress.

     OUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED

     Russ fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he
     walks back inside.

     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a
     fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the
     other.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You all right?

     Bucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands
     him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it.
     The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at
     the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT.

     He exhales deeply.

                          BUCKY
               Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's
               another set of latents up there on the
               doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad
               I can't transfer 'em.

                                                            CUT TO:

     RUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF
     WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG.

     Bucky sits on the ground outside.

     EXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER

     The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has
     ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show 
     Business".

     Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the
     evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him.
     Russ stands in the doorway.

                          BUCKY
               We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All
               of her.
                   (gesturing around the room)
               All right here.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Are you sure you don't want to came home?
               Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch.

                          BUCKY
               No. Thanks. I'll stay here.
                   (re the doorjamb piece)
               I want to get up early and confirm these
               prints.

     Russ nods.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               You're a very very bright penny, Officer.

     He closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT

     Bucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               That night I pictured myself the way I
               wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her
               knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit
               harness bull who cracked the biggest
               unsolved homicide in California history.
               A war hero, a heavyweight champion.

     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN

     Bucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I stayed with her that night and dreamed
               of all the bullshit that would never
               happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at
               all. Because there was no way for me to
               make the arrest without admitting that
               I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The
               case would always be open.
               And so while it killed me to wait 'til
               morning, in some ways...this was our last
               night together.

     INT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING

     Bucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a
     plate.

     INT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS

     Bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the
     cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: "City Employees".

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING

     Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side
     window is open and he pulls himself inside.

     INT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Moving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices
     coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett.

     Bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a
     SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.)
               ...besides, one of my foremen said the
               goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll
               be hell to pay. It's about time I showed
               the three of you good ol' Scotland.

                          MADELEINE
               I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're
               always talking about how dreadful and
               provincial it is.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               ...they've got what you need, lassie.

     Bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side.

                          BUCKY
               And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me?
               Direct line to the straight dope? Or is
               that what you needed?

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Aaah, laddie.

     He eyes the gun.

                          BUCKY
               George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and
               the two of you covered it up.

     On the Spragues, trying to maintain their upper-class cool.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Madeleine)
               You helped Linda Martin and Betty make
               that stag film. Where was the set? In one
               of Daddy's old buildings?

     He levels the gun at Madeleine. Rock steady. Madeleine sits
     on a divan.

                          MADELEINE
               Georgie was always...sneaking around
               Daddy's properties. He saw them make
               it...He...got crazy about Betty.

                          BUCKY
               Of course. She looked like his daughter.

     Off Emmett's shocked look:

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               He fucked your wife. But I don't think
               you cared about that. But he's her daddy.
               And that must have made you crazy. He was
               a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't
               think he was disfigured in a car wreck.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               In the Argonne, Georgie used to bayonet
               the dead Gerries. I saw it. Thrilled him,
               it did. He was...hmm...disturbed. I think
               Ramona found him...a good way to strike
               back at me.

     Bucky points the gun at Madeleine again.

                          BUCKY
               How'd it all go down?

     She hesitates. He shoots a MING VASE next to her. She jumps.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               So many pretty things here...

                          MADELEINE
               It was Sunday I remember...Betty
               called...short of cash as usual.
               I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty
               money to date a nice man he knew.
               Georgie'd been driving Daddy crazy,
               wanting to get with Betty ever since the
               movie. Threatening to tell people he was
               my father. But we thought Georgie just
               wanted her for sex.

     Bucky blows away another objet d'art. The two Spragues huddle
     on the couch.

                          BUCKY
               He was a sick fuck and you knew it!

     Emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog Balto.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               He was passive. He liked to touch dead
               things. His father was a surgeon, did you
               know that? Famous in Scotland.

                          BUCKY
               What did you tell Betty? What did you
               tell her?

                          MADELEINE
               We said he was a war hero. Because we
               didn't want her to feel like a whore.

                          BUCKY
               Then?

                          MADELEINE
               You know the rest.

                          BUCKY
               Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake.

     Madeleine exhales hate.

                          MADELEINE
               I went looking for Linda Martin, and I
               found her at a motel in the Valley. I
               gave her money and told her to say the
               stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican
               crew.

                          BUCKY
               And then what? I come along? Daddy tell
               you to fuck me or was that your idea?

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky--

     Two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth
     of art. Bucky reloads.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               The whole family have a good laugh at
               dinner that night? Pumping me for info
               about the case? Throwing me Georgie
               stories to see if I'd bite? A little
               hospitality and some cunt so I wouldn't
               check out your alibi--

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky--

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Ramona didn't know a thing. Martha--

                          BUCKY
               What about sweet little Martha?

                          MADELEINE
               Martha knew I'd been with Betty. But that
               was all. But she's a demon, you know. She
               even called the cops with a tip on La
               Verne's--just hoping I'd get smeared in
               the papers. I scratched her good for
               that.

                          BUCKY
               Martha tell you this?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY
               Then she lied to get your goat, 'cuz no
               one ever called in a tip on LaVerne's.

                          MADELEINE
               Figures.

     Emmett clears his throat.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               What are you gonna do?

                          BUCKY
               Passports. All four.

     Emmett walks to a small desk. He reaches into the drawer--
     Bucky puts his gun to Emmett's head--

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               Don't insult me, lad.

     He pulls out the four passports (not a gun). Bucky takes
     them.

                          MADELEINE
               We'll ruin you in court, you know. If you
               go after us, we'll ruin you. Over what?
               Some little slut--

     Bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. He
     cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be
     closer.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               You know, laddie. The rich don't
               necessarily own art just for themselves;
               we safekeep it for future generations.

     The dig crosses through Bucky's mind for a moment before he
     shooes it away. To Emmett:

                          BUCKY
               I need to see it.
                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               It?

                          BUCKY
               Just to be sure. I need to see it.

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
               I'm not sure I know...

     Bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from Sprague's
     brain.

                          BUCKY
               I need to see his grave, you tightass
               kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you
               bury George Tilden?

     EXT. A PAUPER'S CEMETERY - DAY

     Bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker: "George
     Tilden. 1906 - 1948.  War Hero and Loyal Friend"

                          VOICE OVER
               When I'd pulled George's print card that
               morning, I'd already laid fifty down with
               Russ that he was our guy. Amateur
               taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop
               39th and Norton woulda been right in the
               middle of his beat...

     INT. THE ROOM WITH THE FILE CABINETS - FLASHBACK

     Bucky pulls Tilden's card and we see the close-up: "George
     Tilden". Added by hand: "Deceased"

                          VOICE OVER
               But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
               wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving
               him ten rounds of Bleichert rage.

     EXT./INT. THE ALUMINUM GARDEN SHED - DAY

     Bucky watches as Russ tips the gas lantern over on its side,
     the gas leaking out into the tin shed.

                          VOICE OVER
               Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or
               probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists
               would've given way to a full load of .45
               in the chest.

     Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses
     it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Sprague said they found him croaked in a
               parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks
               from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just
               croaked. Natural causes, if anything
               about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped
               the evil ate him from the inside out,
               filling him with blackness like the
               sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat)

     Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside
     Elizabeth Short's private hell.

     INT. JANE CHAMBERS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

     Bucky and Jane Chambers drink some iced tea.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               ...and then Eldridge said: I'm sure
               that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not
               my dog and those sure as hell aren't my
               shoes!

     They laugh, Jane a bit more than Bucky. She narrows in on him.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of
               course you've been staking out the
               Sprague house. Four nights in a row.
                   (off his surprise)
               I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost
               as nosy as you.

                          BUCKY
                   (covering)
               Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.

     He gets up from the table.

     INT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown
     painting, always transfixed by it.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
                   (re the painting)
               I'd been thinking about giving it to
               charity, but it's too valuable. I found
               Eldridge's receipt...

     She wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from
     her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the
     clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's a Frederick Yannantuono original,
               inspired by an old classic novel--The
               Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo.

     A FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED

     A blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of 
     pornography--

     BACK TO SCENE

     As the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head
     buzzing...

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               The clown in the painting is the book's
               main character, Gwynplain. When he was a
               child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear
               and then sold to the 16th century Spanish
               aristocracy to be used as a court jester.

     Bucky steps back.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Are you all right, Bucky?

                          BUCKY
               Yes, I'm fine.

     He focuses on her.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Where'd Eldridge get the painting?

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               You'll appreciate the coincidence--

     She hands him the receipt.

     ANGLE ON THE RECEIPT:

     "Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale
     of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart
     Sprague, January 15, 1947."

     Speechless.

                          JANE CHAMBERS
               What is it--

     He's out the door.

     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME

     Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down
     the street...

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME

     Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches
     as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the
     driveway.

     He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to
     find it unlocked. He goes inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Gun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise.

                          RAMONA
               I'm in here, officer.

     A red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into

     RAMONA'S SITTING ROOM

     where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a
     silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her
     gray hair frizzy.

     Bucky trains a gun on her.

                          BUCKY
               I know what you did, Ramona. You and
               Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold
               it the day of the murder. You know I've
               got the book. And now I've got you.

     She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from
     the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike
     revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she
     speaks, it's with complete control.

                          RAMONA
               We see you out there, you know. Every
               night. We see you. You don't fool us. You
               didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt
               Madeleine. And as much as I wish you
               would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a
               voyeur. That's all the lesser classes
               have. Pressing their nose up against the
               glass.

                          BUCKY
               So tell me. Let me see.

     She smiles at him again, loving his need.

                          RAMONA
               Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you
               know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked
               just like Georgie. When he got out of the
               hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a
               present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid
               of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely
               spoke.

     Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her.

                          BUCKY
               Tell me about Betty Short.

     Her face hardens.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
                   (with venom)
               It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become
               obsessed with her...That filthy film.

                          BUCKY
               Your husband bought her for George.

                          RAMONA
               Emmett never stopped hating me.

                          BUCKY
               For George--

                          RAMONA
               For being richer than he was.

     She looks over her nose at him.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I followed them to the bungalow. There
               was a baseball bat under...under a
               tree...She tried to run from me...but she
               was drunk. The first swing knocked her
               out. I made Georgie tie her to the
               mattress....The second swing woke her up.

                          BUCKY
               You tortured her.

     She seems to drift.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               She looked so much like my Maddy. It
               was...the cruelest of jokes.

     Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Martha mustn't know. She's all that's
               left of this family that isn't dying. You
               consider her when you decide whether
               we're worth it.

     Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite
     well.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought
               Martha was going to bring the whole
               family down around her by chance. Her
               little stunt about tipping the police to
               LaVerne's--

                          BUCKY
               She lied about that. To get Madeleine's
               goat.

     Ramona's eyes brighten up.

                          RAMONA
               Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is
               worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is
               on you.

     She speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him.
     And on Bucky's hungry eyes we

                                                            CUT TO:

     BUCKY'S CAR peeling out of Hancock Park.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. THE FAIRFAX PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

     Kay sits at her desk, grading papers. Bucky bursts in.

                          KAY
               Dwight?

                          BUCKY
               How much of the hundred grand did Lee let
               you keep?

     INT. THE TIP DESK - POLICE DEPARTMENT - FLASHBACK

     Bucky and Lee sit at the tip desk while Lee listens to a very
     long call, saying nothing...

     BACK TO SCENE

     Kay and Bucky stare each other down.

                          BUCKY
               He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew
               about Laverne's Hideaway.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT - A FLASHBACK

     Lee Blanchard beats the hell out of Emmett Sprague while
     Madeleine's looks on.

                          BUCKY (VO)
               He blackmailed Sprague--

                          MADELEINE (VO)
               --Don't come over. Daddy's having a
               business soiree--

     INT. THE BATHROOM OF THE POLICE STATION - A FLASHBACK

     Bucky bursts in on Lee washing his bloody fists.

                          LEE
               --Penance for Junior Nash--

     BACK TO SCENE

     Bucky's leaning on the desk...

                          BUCKY
               And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He
               took that hundred thousand and split to
               Mexico and you let him go!

     Kay fingers the edges of an exam. She looks him in the eye.

                          KAY
               You are so, so good at some things.

     He absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue.

                          KAY
               He was going to leave no matter what. I
               didn't know if I was ever going to see
               him again, and I wanted him to be
               comfortable if such a thing was possible.
               Dwight, he knew I was in love with you,
               and he wanted us to be together.

                          BUCKY
               He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the
               bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt.
               He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and
               fucking ran away! This whole time. You
               both knew everything--

     Kay slams down a book.

                          KAY
               Goddammit, Dwight! That girl--that girl!
               I don't give a damn about that girl. She
               ruined our lives!

     The room grinds to a halt.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               He loved us. Don't take that away from
               him. And I love you. And if you hadn't
               seen so much of yourself in her you'd
               realize how much you loved me. (beat) So
               if you're aware of something more
               important than that...I'd like to hear
               what it is.

     Bucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her,
     lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up
     three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out.

     INT. A BAR - NIGHT

     Bucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud
     music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the
     bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT

     Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office
     over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the
     door and flicking on the light to reveal

     BUCKY

     sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He
     trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he
     points the soldier to the door:

                          BUCKY
                   (quoting Lee)
               Adios yourself back to the Halls of
               Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business
               with the lady.

     You don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and
     shuts the door.

                          BUCKY
               I've been pointing my gun at a lot of
               people this week. But I haven't had much
               of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya
               think?

                          MADELEINE
               I think you'd rather fuck me than kill
               me. But you don't have the guts to do
               either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.

     Bucky smiles.

                          BUCKY
                   (Scotchman's burr)
               Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short
               to the very end, eh?

     Now she's curious.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.
               But then again you've got an ear for
               accents. Accents, dressing up in
               costumes...

     Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Do another one for me. Play someone else.
               Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's
               girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do
               another.

                          MADELEINE
               I don't know what you're talking about--

     He cocks the gun.

                          BUCKY
               How 'bout the Mexican accent you used
               when you hired the private dick to track
               down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.
               Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,
               that you wore when you chased after poor
               daddy's money. Tell me something--you
               shoot Lee yourself?

     She steps back against the door as he advances.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did you at least have the guts to shoot
               him yourself?

     He puts the gun to her forehead.

                          MADELEINE
               You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I
               look like her.

     She grins wickedly.

     He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.

     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER

     Cap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance.

                          VOICE OVER
               We took the fall together.

     INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

     Madeleine is interrogated by Homicide dicks.

                          VOICE OVER
               Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine
               Sprague confessed to killing Lee by
               concocting a love triangle from the three
               of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch
               fought over her hand, with Lee beating
               Emmett and demanding he "hand over" his
               daughter when she preferred me.

     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

     As Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and
     a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing
               him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague
               honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia
               murder case at all.

     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY

     Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her
     family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only
     Martha looking like she might survive...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Her story's enough to get her a psych tag
               as a delusional schizophrenic and ten
               years at Atascadero State Hospital.

     INT. THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Bucky sits at a table, staring into the one-way mirror.

                          VOICE OVER
               So the brass girl took the fall for the
               whole family. And I took the fall for me.
               IAD cleared me on the motel shooting--a
               cop's code make-good for Blanchard's
               snuff.
     WE PULL OUT and see Bucky's cuffs, badge and gun sitting on
     the table in front of him.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Afterwards I was fired from the Los
               Angeles Police Department on grounds of
               moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an
               officer. I thought of turning over Ramona
               in hopes of pulling a grandstander's
               turnabout...

     THE CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH THE ONE-WAY MIRROR revealing RUSS
     MILLARD standing on the other side.

                          VOICE OVER
               ...but I had people to protect...People
               who already knew that, for the briefest
               of times, and in the darkest of places, I
               had been so, so, good at some things.

     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky standing amongst the Dahlia files. He begins pulling
     photos off the walls...

     INT. BUCKY AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The destroyed fairy tale house is in mid-repair. Kay is in
     work clothes, painting a new trim in the living room.

     The front door opens. Bucky stands in the doorway, carrying a
     box of Dahlia files. Kay watches as he crosses the room
     without a word and dumps the box of files into the fireplace.
     He tosses on a match and the box goes up in flames.

     She moves to him.

     INT. A CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     We arrive just as she exits, the outline of her body quickly 
     disappearing into the blackness beyond the office door...

                          VOICE OVER
               Thank you Elizabeth.

     FADE TO BLACK

          1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1
                         
                          OPENING CREDITS:
                         
           A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
                         
           In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
           Beautiful and pure.
                         
           The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
           air and carefree.
                         
           She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
                         
           Scared, she peers into the darkness.
                         
           She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
                         
           Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
           She stumbles backwards, frightened.
                         
           She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
           form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
                         
           He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
                         
           She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
           body, sensing something happening to her. Something
           terrifying.
                         
           She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
           beneath the beast's cape.
                         
           She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN
           LAKE.
                         
           CUT TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
                         
           In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
           same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
                         
           The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
           a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
                         
           The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
           towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
                         
           Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
           Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
           atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
           arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.
           2.
                         
          3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
                         
           The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
           large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
                         
           Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
           morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
           legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
                         
           The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
           Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
           she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
           in a ballerina's bun.
                         
           Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
                         
           She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.
                         
                          NINA
                          (WHILE STRETCHING)
           I had the most amazing dream last
           night. I was dancing the White
           Swan.
                         
           No answer.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Different choreography, like the
           Bolshoi's. It was the prologue,
           when Rothbart casts his spell.
                         
           Still no answer.
                         
           Nina continues to stretch.
                         
                         
          4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4
                         
           Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a
           POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.
                         
                          ERICA
           You're in a good mood.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm just excited to get back.
                         
                          ERICA
           Off-season always makes you grumpy.
                         
                          NINA
                          (RE: GRAPEFRUIT)
           Look how pink. So pretty.
           2A.
                         
                          ERICA NINA
           (inside joke) (inside joke)
          Pretty. Pretty.
                         
          They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag
          with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct
          tape, ribbon, thread, etc.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Plus he promised to feature me
           more.
                         
                          ERICA
           He certainly should. You're the
           most dedicated dancer in the
           company.
                         
          Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.
                         
          Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.
          Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
          through the sleeves.
           3.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
                          (NOTICING SOMETHING)
           What's that?
                         
                          NINA
           What?
                         
                          ERICA
           There.
                         
           Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
           SCRATCH MARK.
                         
           She shrugs and shakes her head.
                         
           Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
           Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
                         
           Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
           head.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Sweet girl.
                         
           Erica releases her and Nina begins eating.
                         
                         
          5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5
                         
           Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
           her faint reflection in the train's window.
                         
           Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
           snapping her awake.
                         
           In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
           standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
           playing through iPod earphones.
                         
           Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
           exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
           Mirroring her.
                         
           Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
           Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
           IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.
           4.
                         
           The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
           sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
           but her view's obscured.
                         
           The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
           the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
           doesn't see the girl.
                         
                         
                         6 OMITTED 6
                         
                         
          7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7
                         
           Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
                         
           She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
           other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
           all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
           wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
                         
           She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
           ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
                         
           Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
           the STAGE DOOR.
                         
                         
          8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8
                         
           Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5
           SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
           onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
                         
           Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
           moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.
                         
           In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Can't believe she's back.
                         
                          GALINA
           Of course she is.
                         
                          VERONICA
           She can't take a hint? Company's
           broke. No one comes to see her
           anymore.
                         
                          SOLOIST 1
           No one comes to see ballet period.
           5.
                         
                          VERONICA
           That's not true, I heard the Royal
           had one of their best seasons yet.
                         
                          GALINA
           He needs to try something new.
                         
                          VERONICA
           No, someone new.
                         
                          SOLOIST 1
           Like who?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Like someone who's not approaching
           menopause.
                         
          They snicker.
                         
                          NINA
           I think it's sad.
                         
                          VERONICA
           What's sad?
                         
                          NINA
           Beth's such an amazing dancer.
                         
                          GALINA
           So's my grand-mother.
                         
                          NINA
           Fonteyn danced into her 50's...
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (ROLLING EYES)
           Yeah, we know.
                         
          Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to
          soften the toe.
                         
          Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway.
          Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair
          down. Dark and sexy.
                         
                          NEW GIRL
           Soloists?
                         
          Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.
                         
           NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
           Great.
           6.
                         
           She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down
           at an open spot.
                         
           NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
           Fucking got off the wrong stop and
           had to hoof it from 79th.
                         
           Nina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback.
                         
           The new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts
           getting ready.
                         
                         
          9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9
                         
           Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire
           company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a
           handful of MALE DANCERS.
                         
           LEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around
           her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS.
                         
                          BALLET MISTRESS
           To the back, fondu, to the back,
           plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and
           fifth, to the back...
           (to a corps member)
           Like this. Push it. Why can't you
           do this?
                         
           Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The
           mistress surprises her.
                         
           BALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D)
           It needs to be looser. Relax. Let
           it flow.
                         
           Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction.
                         
           Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
           sweatshirts and insulated pants.
                         
           Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
           company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
           unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.
                         
           The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
           bodies.
                         
           Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and
           glances are thrown his way.
                         
           He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses
           her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.
           7.
                         
          He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.
                         
                          LEROY
           We all know the story: virginal
           girl, pure and sweet, trapped in
           the body of a swan. She desires
           freedom, but only true love can
           break the spell.
                         
          He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,
          then taps another. A selection process of some kind.
                         
          Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Her wish is granted in the form of
           a prince.
                         
          He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.
          He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.
                         
          But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But before he can declare his love,
           her lustful twin, the Black Swan,
           tricks and seduces him.
                         
          He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.
                         
          But he doesn't tap her either.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Devastated, the White Swan leaps
           off a cliff, killing herself. But,
           in death, finds freedom.
                         
          He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.
                         
          The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Good morning, company.
                         
          They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We open our season with Swan Lake.
           Done to death, I know. But not like
           this. We strip it down. Make it
           visceral and real.
                         
          He pauses for effect.
           8.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And a new production needs a new
           Swan Queen. A fresh face to present
           to the world.
                         
           Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep
           their cool.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But which of you can embody both
           swans? The white and the black?
                         
           Nina prepares for disappointment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All the soloists I touched...
           Please go to your scheduled
           rehearsals this afternoon.
                         
           The girls are confused.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           And the girls I didn't touch, meet
           me in studio B at five.
                         
           Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones
           he's selected, purposefully toying with them.
                         
                         
          10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10
                         
           Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously
           HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
                         
           She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going
           through the choreography in her mind. Preparing for the
           audition.
                         
           A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.
                         
           She goes out into the hallway to investigate.
                         
           The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open. Nina
           cautiously approaches.
                         
           Inside, she can see someone moving around the room in a fury,
           trashing it.
                         
           Suddenly, the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts out.
                         
           She makes brief eye-contact with Nina.
                         
                          BETH
           What?!
           9.
                         
           Nina just shakes her head.
                         
           Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down
           the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door
           and peeks inside, curious.
                         
           She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.
                         
                         
          11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11
                         
           Large and comfortable. Beth's presence is everywhere.
           Photographs, clothing, and personal belongings scattered
           across the space.
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles, imagining how
           great it would be...
                         
           Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor. The flowers
           have been shredded, water everywhere.
                         
           She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beth's
           belongings in reverence. The items are neatly laid out:
           ballet supplies, jewelry, and makeup.
                         
           Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK. She picks it up.
                         
           Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room.
                         
                         
          12 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12
                         
           In the middle of her audition, Nina dances Odette's Variation
           from Act II of the ballet, a frightened look on her face.
                         
           Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a
           definite vulnerability. Exactly as the White Swan should be:
           fear tinged with melancholy.
                         
           Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.
                         
           He approaches her and, when he gets close, taps on her
           sternum with two of his fingers.
                         
                          LEROY
           So Nina, would you like to be the
           Swan Queen?
                         
                          NINA
           If you want me to be.
                         
           He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.
           10.
                         
                          LEROY
           Well, if I was just casting the
           White Swan, she'd be yours.
                         
          She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But I'm not.
                         
          He turns to the PIANO PLAYER.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Maestro, Odile's Coda.
                         
          The piano player rifles through the song book.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Show me your Black Swan, Nina.
                         
          Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who
          anxiously await their turn.
                         
          She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player
          and nods.
                         
          The music begins.
                         
          Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most
          difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's
          Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Come on, not so controlled.
                         
          The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the
          next turn.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but
           the court, the audience, the entire
           world! The fouettes are like a
           spider spinning her web. Come on!
           Attack it! Attack it!
                         
          Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.
                         
          A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's
          blowing it.
                         
          The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She
          stumbles, several spins short of finishing.
           11.
                         
           The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to
           an iPod.

                          (SARCASTIC)
           Good of you to join us.
                         
           The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her
           earphones to talk.
                         
                          NEW GIRL
           Sorry.

           Girls, this is Lily. Straight off
           the plane from San Francisco. She's
           filling Rebecca's old spot.
                         
           LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she
           catches her breath.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Go on, get warmed up.
                         
                          LILY
           I'm good.
                         
           Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe
           body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES.
                         
                          NINA
           Should I go again?
                         
                          LEROY
           (distracted by Lily)
           I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.
                         
           She looks down, getting his meaning.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The
           White Swan's variation...
                         
           Furious, Nina marches out of the room.
                         
                         
          A13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13
                         
           Nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the
           toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and
           exits the stall.

          15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15
                         
           Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her
           jacket, for warmth and comfort.
                         
           Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and
           checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away.
                         
           Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
           site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
           scaffolding.
                         
           Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on.
                         
           The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and
           flickering.
                         
           She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side.
                         
           She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She
           stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop.
                         
           She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
           standing there, almost ghostlike.
                         
           Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the
           other woman continues as well.
           13.
                         
           As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and
           discovers...
                         
           The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER.
                         
           But the moment passes as the woman continues walking.
                         
           Nina stares after her, perturbed.
                         
           Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence.
           Nina continues out, ignoring the phone.
                         
                         
          16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16
                         
           Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her.
                         
           She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there.
                         
                          ERICA
           How did it go?
                         
           Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were late, so I called Susie in
           the office. An audition?! Can't
           believe he just sprung that on you.
                         
           Nina nods.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           So?
                         
                          NINA
           It went okay.
                         
                          ERICA
           Just okay?
                         
           Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Darling?
                         
           The tears start falling now.
                         
           Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened.
           14.
                         
          17 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 17
                         
           Nina lies on the floor, stewing. Her legs straight in the air
           to drain the lactic acid in her muscles.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.)
                          (FROM KITCHEN)
           I told them it doesn't matter how
           talented their daughter is, if she
           misses any more classes, she's out.
           She forgets half of what I teach
           her, and I waste time catching her
           up. It's ridiculous.
                         
           Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her
           bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them
           on.
                         
           She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing
           the waters.
                         
           She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again.
           Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor.
                         
           THWACK, THWACK. THWACK.
                         
           She jabs her toe down, hard...
                         
                          NINA
           Ow!
                         
           She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.)
           Everything alright?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine!
                         
           Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe.
           Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood.
                         
           Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on.
                         
           She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and
           starts spinning again.
                         
           Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain,
           but keeps pushing.
                         
           Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins....
                         
           She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.
           14A.
                         
          At the end of the 32nd spin, Nina jabs her foot down hard.
                         
          She's done it!
                         
          Nina looks at herself in the mirror, glazed in sweat, a
          slight smile of satisfaction.
           15.
                         
          18 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 18
                         
           Nina sits on the edge of the bed, as Erica douses some GAUZE
           with PEROXIDE and dabs it on the split toenail. Nina reacts
           to the sting.
                         
                          ERICA
           Shhh. Almost done...You're working
           yourself too hard. We all have off
           days.
                         
                          NINA
           If that girl hadn't barged in.
                         
                          ERICA
           I'm sure she didn't mean to.
           Remember when you started? If I
           hadn't taken you to each of your
           classes, you would have been
           completely lost.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I
           finished it.
                         
                          ERICA
           He knows you can do the coda. It
           won't convince him one way or the
           other.
                         
           Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother. 
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D) 
           Oh, sweetheart, I know it's 
           disappointing. When you start to 
           get older, there's all this 
           ridiculous pressure. God knows, I 
           understand. 
                         
           Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it
           into Nina's calves.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           But it's alright. No matter what. 
           You'll probably get to dance the
           Pas de Quatre again. That's such a
           wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make
           you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll
           shine.
                         
                          NINA
           I know, mom.
           15A.
                         
          Erica removes Nina's EARRINGS, then opens a JEWELRY BOX
          sitting on the night stand and drops them inside. A TOY
          BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC.
                         
          Nina gets under the covers. Erica tucks her in and sits down
          on the edge of the bed.
           16.
                         
                          ERICA
           Everything will be better in the
           morning. It always is.
                         
           She strokes Nina's hair, humming along to the music.
                         
           Nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined
           stare.

          21 INT. SUBWAY - DAY 21
                         
           Nina applies the lipstick she stole from Beth, using the side
           window as a mirror. The jerky motion of the train makes it
           difficult, but she manages.
                         
                         
          22 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 22
                         
           Nina waits anxiously outside Leroy's office.
                         
           She hears someone approach, looks up and sees Leroy coming
           down the hall.
                         
           She puts on a nervous smile. He doesn't reciprocate.
                         
                          LEROY
           Yes, Nina?
                         
                          NINA
           Do you have a minute?
                         
           He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and
           walks in.
                         
           She takes a breath and then follows.
                         
                         
          23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23
                         
           Nina closes the door and faces the cozy, dark space. Large
           couch, posters from the ballet on the wall--several featuring
           Beth.
                         
           Leroy lights a cigarette, quietly studying her and not making
           this easy. He takes a drag, and exhales.

           If now's not a good time...
                         
                          LEROY
           Now's fine, what is it?
                         
                          NINA
           I just wanted to tell you, I
           practiced the coda last night, and
           I did it.
                         
                          LEROY
           How thrilling for you.
                         
                          NINA
                          (THROWN)
           Well...
                         
                          LEROY
           Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly
           don't care about your technique,
           you should know that by now.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes, but-
                         
                          LEROY
           Anyway, I've already chosen
           Veronica, so...
                         
          He lifts his hands in the air, "there you go."
                         
                          NINA
                          (DEVASTATED)
           I see.
                         
          She makes a move towards the door.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're not going to try and change
           my mind?
                         
          She looks back at him, uncertain.
                         
          Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You must have thought it was
           possible, coming to find me like
           this.
                         
          He pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher
          her.
           18.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Why are you here? All dolled up?
                         
                          NINA
                          (UNSURE)
           I came to ask you to give me the
           part.
                         
                          LEROY
           That all?
                         
          She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and
          approaches her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Truth is, when I look at you, all I
           see is the White Swan. Yes, you're
           beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal
           casting. But the Black Swan...it's
           a hard fucking job to dance both.
                         
                          NINA
           I can be the Black Swan too.
                         
                          LEROY
           Really? She's hungry, volatile. In
           four years, every time you dance, I
           see you obsess over getting each
           move exactly right, but I never see
           you lose yourself.
                         
          Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           All that discipline, for what?
                         
                          NINA
           I want to be perfect.
                         
          He laughs.
                         
                          LEROY
           Perfection's not just about
           control. It's also about letting
           go. Surprising the audience.
           Surprising yourself. Transcendence.
                         
          He considers her for a moment.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Very few have it in them.
                         
                          NINA
                          I-
           18A.
                         
          Without warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth.
                         
          It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away.
                         
                          LEROY
           Ow! Fuck!
                         
          He touches his lip, stunned.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You bit me.
           19.
                         
           She's too scared to respond.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (AMUSED)
           I can't believe it. That fucking
           hurt.
                         
           He goes to the mirror to check for damage. He glances back at
           Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (MUMBLED)
           Sorry.
                         
           She quickly leaves, shell-shocked.
                         
                         
          24 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 24
                         
           The company stretch and go through their usual warm-up
           routine, a tension in the air. The casting decision still
           uncertain.
                         
           Nina touches her lips, thinking about the encounter. Then
           looks over at Veronica, knowing the good news in store.
           Veronica notices. Nina looks away.
                         
                          VERONICA
                          (IRKED)
           What?
                         
           Nina shakes her head.
                         
           A sudden energy sweeps the room, and she hears the sound of
           scuffling feet and whispering. "It's up." "She just posted
           it." "C'mon."
                         
           The dancers start exiting into the hallway. Veronica turns to
           follow.
                         
                          NINA
           Veronica?
                         
           Veronica turns around. It's hard, but Nina decides to be a
           good loser.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Congratulations.
                         
           Nina subtly glances at the exiting girls and Veronica
           immediately gets it.
                         
           She excitedly pushes through the crowd of girls, wanting to
           see for herself.
           20.
                         
           Knowing the outcome already, Nina continues stretching in the
           deserted space, resigned to her fate. She finishes, grabs
           her belongings and walks out.
                         
                         
          25 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - SAME 25
                         
           A crowd of dancers surround the bulletin board, jostling to
           get a look.
                         
           Nina starts walking down the hall in the opposite direction.
                         
           Behind her, she can hear a small commotion and then:
                         
           VERONICA (O.S.)
           Why did you tell me that?
                         
           She turns and sees Veronica, her face flushed with anger.
                         
                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           Your idea of a joke?
                         
                          NINA
                          (CONFUSED)
           What?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Fuck you.
                         
           Veronica storms away.
                         
           The group of girls stares at Nina, making her very self-
           conscious.
                         
           Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board, to see what
           Veronica's outburst was all about.
                         
           First a few, then more and more of the girls smile at her.
           They make room for her as she pushes through.
                         
           She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE, finds "Swan Queen"
                          AND UNDERNEATH:
                         
                          NINA SAYERS
                         
           Stunned, she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas.
                         
           She sees Lily eyeing her with a flat expression, which turns
           into a smile to mask her disappointment.
                         
           The other girls start congratulating and hugging Nina, some
           more sincerely than others.
           21.
                         
          26 INT. THEATER BATHROOM - DAY 26
                         
           Nina bursts in through the door and heads directly for one of
           the stalls.
                         
           She locks herself in for privacy and dials a number on her
           CELL PHONE. She holds it to her ear, anxiously waiting for
           the person to answer.
                         
                          NINA
           Hey...Everything's fine...He picked
           me, mommy.
                         
           She waits for a response.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going
           to be the Swan Queen.
                         
           Nina laughs at her mother's response and can't help but start
           crying.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'll be home soon, okay? I just had
           to tell you.
                         
           Nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing. She's
           dreamt of this for so long, it's almost too much to bear.
                         
           She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls
           herself together. She comes out of the stall...
                         
           Horrified to discover "WHORE" written on the mirror in RED
           LIPSTICK.
                         
           Nina looks around the bathroom, to make sure she's alone.
                         
           She snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult, smearing
           the mirror with red streaks.
                         
                         
          27 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 27
                         
           Nina unlocks the door to the apartment.
                         
                          NINA
           Mom?
                         
           Nina looks around, puzzled she isn't there.
                         
                         
          28 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER 28
                         
           Nina opens the door and pokes her head in.
           22.
                         
           But Erica's not in there either. Nina glances at the walls.
                         
           Where several homemade PAINTINGS hang, all of the same
           subject: Nina as a young girl, posing in a tutu. On a desk,
           the ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH is clipped to a painting in progress.
                         
           Out of the corner of her eye, one of the portraits seems to
           shift. Nina turns towards it, but the painting's now
           perfectly still.
                         
           Unsettled, Nina withdraws.
                         
                         
          29 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29
                         
           Post-shower, Nina's fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam
           covered mirror.
                         
           Nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across, to see herself
           more clearly.
                         
           She looks nervous. The enormity of what's in front of her
           setting in.
                         
           She turns side-to-side, scrutinizing her body. She lifts her
           arm and pinches the skin to check her weight.
                         
           She notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder. A
           small RASH.
                         
           She feels the bumps with her fingers, bothered.
                         
           She checks the same place on her other shoulder.
                         
           There's no rash, just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE.
                         
           Nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it.
                         
           In the mirror now, one of the bumps is scratched and
           bleeding.
                         
           Nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger.
                         
           The sound of the front door opening steals her attention.
                         
                         
          30 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 30
                         
           Nina exits the bathroom wearing a robe.
                         
           In the kitchen, she sees a CAKE with a lit SPARKLER sitting
           on the table. Her mother smiles anxiously.
           23.
                         
                          ERICA
           My daughter, the Swan Queen.
                         
           She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug.
                         
           She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with
           frosting. Nina hides her disdain.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, mom.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's our favorite, vanilla with
           strawberry filling.
                         
           Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a little piece.
                         
           Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           That's way too much.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's a celebration.
                         
                          NINA
           My stomach's still in knots.
                         
                          ERICA
                          (OFFENDED)
           Fine then.
                         
           Erica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GUILTY)
           Mom, don't. I'm sorry.
                         
           Erica hesitates, but returns. She sets the cake back down.
                         
                          ERICA
           I'm just so proud of you.
                         
           Erica lifts the slice onto a plate.
                         
                          NINA
           It looks yummy.
                         
                         
                         31 OMITTED 31
           24.
                         
          32 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 32
                         
           First day in the new role, Nina stretches alone.
                         
           Muffled sounds of other ballerinas chatting and giggling
           drift in from the large rehearsal space. Makes Nina feel a
           little isolated.
                         
           DAVID (O.S.)
           Hey there...
                         
           Nina turns and sees DAVID, the high-cheeked, cocky dancer
           playing Prince Siegfried.
                         
                          DAVID (CONT'D)
           It is so full, where do I stand.
                         
           It is his version of a joke. Nina politely laughs.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah...good luck finding a spot.
                         
                          DAVID
           I am David.
                         
                          NINA
           I know you are. I'm Nina.
                         
                          DAVID
           Yes. Here we go, huh?
                         
           She nods, nervous.
                         
                         
          33 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER 33
                         
           David dances around the space, miming a hunt with a cross-
           bow.
                         
           Nina enters, stretches her body to illustrate her
           transformation into human, then sees David and acts spooked.
           25.
                         
           She dances away from him, a scared look on her face,
           undulating her arms to resemble a bird's flapping.
                         
           David gives chase, but Nina spins out of his grasp,
           disentangles from him.
                         
           But he eventually snags her, and they come very close
           together.
                         
                          LEROY
           Okay!
                         
           The music stops. Nina breaks out of character and looks at
           Leroy, anxious for his reaction.
                         
           The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles, clearly pleased.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Okay, Nina. Very good.
                         
           Nina smiles, relieved. Leroy hops out of his chair and
           approaches.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But I knew the White Swan wouldn't
           be a problem. The real work will be
           your metamorphosis into the Black
           Swan.
                         
                          NINA
           Okay.
                         
                          LEROY
           I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get
           ready to show me more of that bite.
                         
           He gives her an impish smirk. She looks down, embarrassed.
                         
                         
          34 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 34
                         
           Nina takes a drink from the water fountain. She hears music
           emanating from the large rehearsal studio.
                         
           Curious, she walks to the open doorway and stops to watch.
                         
           CORPS MEMBERS and a few soloists form two lines on both sides
           of the room. In the middle, Veronica dances along with Lily.
                         
           Nina pays close attention to Lily, sizing her up. Her dancing
           is explosive, exudes sex.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Watch the way she moves...
           26.
                         
           Leroy has snuck up behind Nina at the doorway and gets very
           close to her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Imprecise, but sensual. She's not
           faking it. Pay attention.
                         
           Lily makes a small mistake, but cracks up laughing, amused
           rather than bothered by her blunder.
                         
           Nina stares at her, attracted and threatened.
                         
                         
          A35 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A35
                         
           The company's administrator, SUSIE, shows Nina into the room.
                         
                          SUSIE
           You share with Beth from now on, so
           be considerate.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks, Susie.
                         
           Awed, Nina looks around the room. She scans Beth's
           photographs and personal belongings, and lands on a large
           bouquet of FRESH FLOWERS.
                         
                          SUSIE
           Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy.
                         
                          NINA
           Beautiful.
                         
           Susie leaves.
                         
           Nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint
           smile curls her lips.
                         
           She opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She
           pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on.
                         
                         
          35 INT. PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - NIGHT 35
                         
           Leroy pulls Nina through a fundraiser gala, filled with rich
           looking PATRONS and some DANCERS from the company.
                         
           Bewildered, Nina takes in her high-society surroundings,
           getting the occasional curious glance as she passes.
                         
           Leroy grabs a couple CHAMPAGNE glasses off a WAITER'S tray.
           He hands a glass to Nina with a smile.
           27.
                         
          He leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the
          party.
                         
                          LEROY
           Ready to be thrown to the wolves?
           We need their cash, so smile. 
                         
          She smiles, as instructed.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
                         
          The crowd turns their gaze towards them. All eyes on her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As I stand here tonight, I see so
           many familiar faces. Your 
           contribution to the art we all
           cherish profoundly goes straight to
           my heart and I am very grateful.
                         
          Polite applause.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Let me begin with a very important
           announcement. You all have had the
           chance to be enchanted,
           transported, sometimes devastated
           by the performances of this true
           artist of our company. She has been
           an exceptional inspiration to my
           work, a role model to our dancers
           and a deeply satisfying presence on
           our stage. You all know who I am
           talking about...Beth Macintyre
                         
          More applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her
          cuticles.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As we all know, every great career
           comes to an end. Beth is retiring
           at the end of the season. She will
           be giving her farewell performance
           as Melpomene, the role she
           originated in my first ballet.
                         
          People start whispering, stunned by the news. Nina sees Beth
          in the crowd, giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests.
          Trying to remain dignified.
           28.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           She will be greatly missed, but she
           will always be remembered. My
           little princess.
                         
           Amidst the mummering, Nina sees Beth quietly sneak out of the
           crowd and out the front door. Leroy quickly covers.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           But as we bid adieu to one star, we
           welcome another!
                         
           He looks at Nina. She stops picking her nails, self-
           conscious.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           As you know, we open our season
           with my new version of Swan Lake.
           Taking the role of our new Swan
           Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina
           Sayers.
                         
           Restrained APPLAUSE.
                         
           Nina steps forward and curtseys. Someone seems to GIGGLE at
           her. Insecure, Nina glances towards the source and sees Lily
           flirting with a RICH GENT, uninterested in the official
           proceedings.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Soon you will have the pleasure of
           seeing her perform, tonight we
           raise a glass. To all of you, to
           Nina, to Beth, to beauty!
                         
           He downs his drink and the crowd follows suit.
                         
                         
          36 INT. LIVING ROOM, PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - LATER 36
                         
           PARTY GUESTS surround Nina and Leroy, trying to meet the
           company's newest star. Nina basks in all the attention.
                         
                          LEROY
           Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife,
           Ellen, tonight's sponsors.
                         
           She shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON.
                         
                          NINA
           Such a beautiful event.
           29.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON
           Not as beautiful as you, dear.
                         
           Nina demurs. They're replaced by another HUSBAND and WIFE.
                         
                          LEROY
           And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein.
                         
           Nina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of
           her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away.
                         
           Leroy leans in and whispers in her ear.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Relax, you're doing great.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          37 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 37
                         
           Nina washes her hands. She looks at herself in the mirror and
           takes a deep breath.
                         
           Someone KNOCKS on the door.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a second.
                         
           She turns off the water and wipes her damp hands on the back
           of her neck, trying to cool herself.
                         
           She checks her finger. No blood, but there's a HANGNAIL.
                         
           Nina takes hold of the small flap and tries to yank it off.
                         
           Accidentally tearing a strip of skin from the nail to her
           second knuckle.
                         
           More KNOCKING startles her.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Come on! I'm about to burst!
                         
           Nina quickly balls up the peeled skin and throws it away.
                         
           She opens the door.
           30.
                         
          Lily pushes in.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Hey! Look who it is.
                         
          Lily closes the door behind her and locks it.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I'm Lily, by the way. Don't think
           we've officially met.
                         
                          NINA
                          (RATTLED)
           Nina.
                         
                          LILY
           Our New Swan Queen! That is so
           huge! You must be freaking out.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah...
                         
          Lily slides her PANTIES out from under her dress and puts
          them in her clutch.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I should probably get back.
                         
                          LILY
           Stay. Keep me company.
                         
          Lily starts to refresh her makeup.
                         
          Nina stays put for a second, uncertain.
                         
                          NINA
           Excuse me.
           31.
                         
           She opens the door and steps out, where she's immediately met
           by Leroy.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Ah, there you are.
                         
           Lily closes the door behind her.
                         
                         
          38 EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 38
                         
           Leroy escorts Nina out. It's a couple hours later and she's
           tipsy. She stumbles a little and grabs onto Leroy.
                         
                          NINA
           I think I drank too much. All those
           toasts...
                         
                          LEROY
           You did well.
                         
                          NINA
           Really?
                         
                          LEROY
           They tried to eat you alive, but
           here you are, in one piece.
                         
                          NINA
                          (MELTING)
           I guess.
                         
                          LEROY
           I'll get you a cab. Where you
           going?
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, Upper West Side.
                         
                          LEROY
           Why don't you come to my place
           first? It's on the way.
                         
           She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and
           hiding her excitement.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           For a drink. Unless you've had
           enough.
                         
                          NINA
           No, that's good.
                         
           He starts to look for a cab.
           32.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON (O.S.)
           Thomas!!!
                         
          They turn, see Mrs. Brinson, the host of the party, standing
          at the door.
                         
           MRS. BRINSON (CONT'D)
           You need to say hello to Karen
           Halloway before you disappear.
           She's from Texas. Correction: she
           is Texas.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (TO NINA)
           A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait
           here.
                         
          He runs back inside to say his goodbyes.
                         
          Nina smiles after him, giddy and anxious.
                         
          She notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of
          the adjoining doorway. In the dark, she looks like Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (CONCERNED)
           Hello?
                         
          Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear.
                         
          Nina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone.
                         
          She gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT,
          startling her.
                         
          It's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Beth? What are you doing out here?
                         
          Beth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her
          earlobe.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I was crushed to hear that you're
           leaving.
                         
                          BETH
           What'd you do to get the role?
           33.
                         
          Nina shakes her head, confused.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           He always said you were a frigid
           little girl.
                         
          Her words needle Nina, too close to the truth.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           So what did you do to make him
           change his mind? Suck his cock?
                         
                          NINA
           Some of us don't need to do that.
                         
          Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.
                         
                          BETH
           You fucking little whore.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GUILTY)
           Beth, I'm-
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           What's going on?
                         
          They both turn to see Leroy returned.
                         
                          BETH
           I need to talk to you.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're drunk. You should go home.
                         
                          BETH
           Don't do that! Don't just dismiss
           me!
                         
                          LEROY
                          (EXASPERATED)
           Poor, poor little princess. Try to
           hold it together.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm going to drop by later, okay? I
           have something I want to give you.
                         
                          LEROY
                          (IGNORING HER)
           Come on.
                         
          He puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away.
           34.
                         
           BETH (O.S.)
           A token of my appreciation.
                         
           He ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they
           enter the cab, Beth calls after them.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Make the most of it Nina.
                         
           Through the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her
           words.
                         
                         
          39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
                         
           Tasteful but spare loft. Modern and expensive furniture.
           Large windows.
                         
           Nina stands alone, looking around his inner sanctum, wide-
           eyed.
                         
           She explores the pieces of art, the furniture. She touches
           some of it, in awe.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Here.
                         
           She turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of
           champagne. For himself, a scotch.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks.
                         
           She looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead,
           he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to
           sit as well.
                         
           Confused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch.
                         
           He takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her.
           Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well.
                         
                          LEROY
           I thought it'd be good to talk
           about the role. Ground us a little.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes.
                         
                          LEROY
           The better we get to know each
           other, the more productive we'll
           be. I don't want there to be any
           boundaries between us.
           35.
                         
                          NINA
           Me neither.
                         
                          LEROY
           Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?
                         
          She's caught off guard by his question and just smiles
          uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a
          reply.
                         
                          NINA
           No...
                         
                          LEROY
           Have you had many in the past?
                         
                          NINA
           A few. But no one serious.
                         
                          LEROY
           You're not a virgin, are you?
                         
          Her expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes
          her head.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Then there's nothing to be
           embarrassed about, is there?
           (she shakes her head)
           And you enjoy making love?
                         
                          NINA
           Excuse me?
                         
                          LEROY
           Sex. Do you enjoy it?
                         
          Blushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           We need to be able to talk about
           this.
                         
                          NINA
           Okay.
                         
                          LEROY
           So?
                         
          Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs.
                         
          He smirks, and joins her on the couch.
           36.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           I have a homework assignment for
           you.
                         
                          NINA
           Yes?
                         
                          LEROY
           Go home and masturbate. Live a
           little.
                         
           She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and
           stands.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           It's late. Lots of work tomorrow.
           The doorman will find you a cab.
                         
           He leaves her alone in the living room.
                         
                         
          40 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40
                         
           Nina looks at herself in the mirror, removing bobbie-pins, as
           Erica folds clothing and puts it away.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sounds like quite an evening. Wish
           I could have been there.
                         
                          NINA
           You know I asked.
                         
                          ERICA
           I know, Susie told me. Guess he
           wanted you all to himself.
                         
                          NINA
           That's not why.
                         
           Erica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror.
                         
                          ERICA
           I don't blame him.
                         
           Erica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Where did you get these?
                         
                          NINA
           They're fake.
           37.
                         
                          ERICA
           Fooled me.
                         
           Erica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip
           her. Nina faces her.
                         
                          NINA
           I can do it.
                         
                          ERICA
           Turn.
                         
           Nina turns back around, reticent.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           He must have been at your side all
           night, showing you off.
                         
           Erica finishes unzipping the red dress and sees Nina's
           shoulder.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Oh Nina...
                         
           Remembering, Nina pulls away from her.
                         
                          NINA
           It's just a rash.
                         
           Erica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you talking about?
                         
           Nina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and
           irritated from scratching.
                         
                          NINA
           It was worse a couple days ago.
           It's already getting better.
                         
                          ERICA
           You've been scratching again.
                         
                          NINA
                          NO-
                         
           Erica yanks her out of the room.
                         
                         
          41 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 41
                         
           Nina sits on the toilet, stripped to her underwear. She does
           her best to cover herself.
           38.
                         
           Erica finishes dabbing her back with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and
           replaces the cap on the bottle.
                         
           She pulls out NAIL CLIPPERS and cuts Nina's nails down to
           their base. Each CLICK makes Nina twitch.
                         
                          ERICA
           I thought you'd outgrown this
           disgusting habit.(click) You
           haven't done it for years. (click)
                         
                          NINA
           Mom, please.
                         
           Erica grabs Nina's other hand.
                         
                          ERICA
           It's the role, isn't it? All this
           pressure... I was worried it'd be
           too much.
                         
           Nina stares at her, seething.
                         
                         
          42 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - LATER 42
                         
           Nina crawls into bed, avoiding her mother's eyes.
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't be mad at me. You know I love
           you, you know I want what's best.
           But we have to take care of you.
                         
           Nina doesn't respond.
                         
           Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins
           playing.
                         
           She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair.
                         
           Nina tries to brush her hand away.
                         
           But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking.
                         
                         
          43 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 43
                         
           Nina lies wide awake after a restless night.
                         
           She slowly reaches down under the covers, down between her
           legs, to complete Leroy's "homework assignment."
                         
           She closes her eyes and starts to maneuver.
           39.
                         
           She suddenly hears a RUSTLING sound and a short SNORE.
                         
           She freezes and opens her eyes. She slowly sits up in bed and
           sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room.
                         
           Nina glares at her.
                         
                         
          44 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 44
                         
           Nina waits her turn as a row of DANCERS perform grand jetes
           diagonally across the room.
                         
           She watches Veronica perform her leaps. She rejoins the
           group, giving Nina a nasty stare.
                         
           Nina avoids it, looking towards Lily, who gives her a small
           smile.
                         
           Just as Nina's turn arrives, a panicked YOUNG CORPS DANCER
           rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress.
                         
           Nina takes one leap and then stops dancing, sensing
           something's wrong.
                         
           The corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress' ear. A
           look of shock on the mistress' face.
                         
           The dancer collapses into the older woman's arms.
                         
           The piano music trickles to a halt.
                         
           Nina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers.
                         
           First a few, then more dancers approach the two women,
           wanting to find out what's happened.
                         
           Nina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling.
                         
                         
          45 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER FOUNTAIN - DAY 45
                         
           Nina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of
           water.
                         
                          NINA
           What happened?
           40.
                         
                          LEROY
           She walked into the street, got hit
           by a car.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh my god...
                         
                          LEROY
           I'm sure she did it on purpose.
                         
                          NINA
           How do you know?
                         
                          LEROY
           Everything Beth ever did came from
           within. From some dark impulse.
           It's what could make her so
           thrilling to watch. Even perfect at
           times. But also destructive.
                         
           Nina hesitates, but has to ask.
                         
                          NINA
           Was it right after we saw her?
                         
                          LEROY
           It's not your problem. This has
           nothing to do with you.
                         
           She looks away, not so sure.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina, don't let yourself be
           distracted. Dance is not
           immortalized like music, poetry or
           art. It lives for now. For this
           moment only. And this is your
           moment.
                         
           She attempts a nod.
                         
                         
          A46 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A46
                         
           Beth's belongings have already been packed up and cleared.
           Guilt-ridden, Nina tries to get ready.
                         
           She picks up her duffel bag, and removes her SATCHEL. She
           unpacks its contents onto the counter: needle and thread,
           cigarettes, a makeup compact, and the tube of lipstick.
                         
           She looks over at the vase of flowers. A few have wilted.
                         
           She pulls them out to make the bouquet look fresh again.
           41.
                         
          46 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 46
                         
           Nina exits the elevator with a BROWN SHOPPING BAG. She walks
           down a stark hallway and approaches Beth's hospital room.
                         
           Members of BETH'S FAMILY surround the bed, blocking Beth from
           view.
                         
           Nina considers going in, but shyly sulks past, drawing the
           attention of an OLDER NURSE.
                         
                          OLDER NURSE
           You can go in.
                         
                          NINA
           It's okay.
                         
           The older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on
           her rounds.
                         
           Nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to
           wait.
                         
           She hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees
           the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall,
           comforting one another.
                         
           Nina steps out from hiding and goes inside.
                         
                         
          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- DAY 47
                         
           Beth is bandaged and unconscious, attached to MACHINES.
                         
           Nina stands at a distance, too intimidated to approach at
           first.
                         
           She looks around the room. It is lined with large, EXPENSIVE-
           LOOKING BOUQUETS.
                         
           She removes the flowers Leroy gave her from the brown bag,
           and sets them next to the others.
                         
           Nina slowly approaches Beth's bedside.
                         
           Beth's face is heavily wrapped with bandages. Only her closed
           eyes and pale lips can be seen.
                         
           She scans down her body, sees a sliver of her thigh, purple
           with bruises.
                         
           Curious, Nina lifts the top edge of the blanket and peeks
           underneath.
           42.
                         
           The legs are bloated and horribly bruised, pierced with large
           pins to reset the shattered bones.
                         
           She looks lower and lower, and discovers MAGGOTS feeding on
           her ankles.
                         
           Nina turns away, confronted by the Older Nurse.
                         
                          OLDER NURSE
           What are you doing?!
                         
           Nina doesn't have an answer. She just stumbles out the door.
                         
                         
          A48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A48
                         
           Nina steps out of her apartment into the dim hallway, lugging
           a bag of trash.
                         
           She notices some WOODEN DEBRIS from an apartment renovation
           sitting near the trash chute.
                         
           Nina drops the trash bag in the chute, then picks up a piece
           of BROKEN WOOD.
                         
           She considers it for a moment, and hides it inside the sleeve
           of her sweatshirt.
                         
                         
          B48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - LATER B48
                         
           Nina quietly steps inside and heads towards her bedroom.
                         
           Through Erica's open bedroom door, Nina can see Erica busily
           sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes, humming to herself.
                         
           Nina quietly slips back inside her room.
                         
           She removes the wood piece and jams it between the door
           closet, creating a makeshift doorjamb
                         
           She tests it. Holds pretty well.
                         
           She hears a creek. FOOTSTEPS approach. She removes the wood
           and sticks it inside her dresser, not ready just yet.
                         
           She quickly lies down on her bed and waits to be tucked in.
                         
           The door SQUEAKS open, and Nina looks towards it.

          48A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 48A
                         
           Nina, David, and the dancer playing ROTHBART rehearse the
           Black Swan and Prince Siegfried's Pas De Deux from Act 3.
                         
           David lifts her, then sets her down, and they lean-in towards
           each other, almost kissing.
                         
                          LEROY
           No, no, not so stiff. Don't be
           scared of him.
                         
           She pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales,
           frustrated.
           43-46.
                         
          48B INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48B
                         
           Nina and David dance the next part of the section, looking
           more worn out.
                         
                          LEROY
           Forget about control. I want to see
           passion.
                         
           She still looks tense, not getting it.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Let it out!
                         
                         
          48C INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48C
                         
           Nina practices with an OLDER BALLET MISTRESS. She
           demonstrates a movement, and Nina mimics her. The mistress
           scrutinizes, unimpressed.
                         
                         
          A49 INT. PHYSICAL THERAPIST'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY A49
                         
           Nina is worked over by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST. Every joint and
           muscle aches, but Nina breathes through the pain.
                         
                         
          49A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - YET ANOTHER DAY 49A
                         
           Nina and David finish the section, completely soaked with
           sweat.
                         
           They look at Leroy, heaving breaths.
                         
                          LEROY
           David, answer me this question: are
           you interested in fucking her?
                         
           David snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           No, of course not. No one would be.
                         
           Leroy comes face to face with her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina, your Black Swan still looks
           no different than your White Swan.
           She's's just as...frigid.
                         
          49B Suddenly, the lights turn off, throwing them into total 49B
           darkness.
           43-46A.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Fuck!
                         
           Leroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           (to someone in hall)
           Hey! We're still working in here.
           Lights back on.
                         
           There's a momentary pause, and then the lights return.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Thank you!
           (to David, Piano Player)
           Okay, you guys can go. Thank you
           for your patience.
                          (TO NINA)
           You stay.
                         
           David gives her an insinuating glance, then shakes his head.
           Very used to Leroy's "methods."
                         
                          DAVID
           Have fun.
                         
           David and the Piano Player leave them alone.
                         
          49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C
                         
                          LEROY
           I'll be the Prince.
                         
           Made nervous by his touch, she nods.
                         
           He walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist.
                         
           He starts humming the score. And then they begin.
                         
           They do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her.
                         
           He lets go, she moves away from him.
                         
                          LEROY
           Use each finger, your face, your
           tits, everything. Entice me!
                         
           He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other
           wrist, she spins to face him.
                         
           They get very close.
                         
           Just before they kiss she dips, pulls away.
           43-46B.
                         
          He grabs her arm again, she spins, then he stops her, her
          back to him.
                         
          He runs his hands down her arms. Slowly, seductively. She
          trembles.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Just feel my touch and respond.
                         
          She turns and leans in close, as though to kiss him... almost
          touching lips...but then she tries to push off again. He
          tightens his grip, holds her there.
                         
          She looks back at him, questioning. He looks at her
          intently, pulls her to him, and kisses her.
                         
          She melts and eagerly kisses him back. He pulls away,
          momentarily.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Slow down. Open your mouth.
                         
          She doesn't.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
                          (INSISTENT)
           Open it.
                         
          Nina follows his instruction.
                         
          The kiss grows more heated and he wraps his arms around her.
                         
          He pushes her back against the mirror. She whimpers.
                         
          He runs his hand down her body, then reaches between her
          legs. She GASPS, tries to pull his hand out, but he persists.
                         
          She throws her head back as he kisses her neck. She breathes
          deep, emits short MOANS, succumbing...
                         
          Suddenly, he pulls away from her. She looks at him confused,
          flushed and breathing hard.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           That was me seducing you. It needs
           to be the other way around.
                         
          He turns and starts to walk away. She can't believe it.
                         
                          NINA
           Please don't...
                         
          He ignores her and walks out of the room.
           47.
                         
          50A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER 50A
                         
           Nina sits on the floor, head in hands.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Hey...
                         
           Nina startles and looks up. Sees the dark figure of somebody
           watching her from the doorway. Looks like HERSELF.
                         
                          NINA
           Who's that?
                         
           Lily emerges from the darkness, dressed to leave.
                         
                          LILY
           You okay?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine.
                         
                          LILY
           You sure?
                         
          50B Lily sits down beside her, oblivious of Nina's desire 50B
           to be left alone.
                         
           She digs out a cigarette from her bag. Offers it to Nina.
           Nina doesn't take it.
                         
                          NINA
           We can't smoke in here.
                         
                          LILY
           I won't tell if you won't.
           48.
                         
          Nina reluctantly takes the cigarette, holds it a little
          awkwardly, clearly not a regular smoker.
                         
          Lily sparks a flame for her and then lights one for herself.
          Nina puffs, but doesn't inhale. Lily smirks.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Big day's getting closer and
           closer, huh? I can't wait. You're
           going to be amazing.
                         
                          NINA
           Thanks...
                         
          Nina wipes off her tears with her hand.
                         
                          LILY
           So, want to talk about it?
                         
                          NINA
           Just had a hard day.
                         
                          LILY
           Leroy play too rough?
                         
          Nina looks at her surprised.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           He seems like a prick.
                         
                          NINA
           He's brilliant.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure, but not exactly warm and
           fuzzy.
                         
                          NINA
           You don't know him.
                         
          Lily smirks with a realization.
                         
                          LILY
           Someone's hot for teacher.
                         
          Nina gives her a withering glance.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I don't blame you.
                         
          Nina stands up.
           49.
                         
                          NINA
           I should go. It's getting late.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey, I was only playing.
                         
           Nina walks towards the door.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Nina?
                         
           She ignores Lily and exits.

          52A INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 52A
                         
           Nina lies in the bath, eyes closed, concentrating.
                         
           Her body jostles slightly, moving her hand between her legs,
           seeking release.
                         
           Growing frustrated, she moves more and more aggressively.
                         
           She abruptly stops and submerges herself under the water,
           defeated.
                         
           She lies still, her arms wrapped around her chest.
                         
           She opens her eyes, her vision distorted by the water.
                         
           Suddenly, her blurred Double appears, staring down at her.
                         
           Nina shoots up.
                         
           The Double is gone.
                         
           Nina scans the bathroom, but she is alone.
                         
           Nina notices some water dropping off her fingers, onto the
           lip of the tub.
                         
           Then a few drops of RED land on the white porcelain.
                         
           Worried, she examines her fingernails, which have started to
           grow back. She discovers blood and bits of skin.

           Out of the tub, Nina checks herself in the mirror. Her
           shoulder is streaked with deep SCRATCHES.
                         
           She grabs a pair of little SCISSORS from the medicine cabinet
           and starts trimming her fingernails.
                         
           She looks up at the mirror and sees her reflection snip off
           the tip of her index finger.
                         
           Nina GASPS and drops the scissors, CLANGING in the sink. Two
           of her fingers are bleeding, their tips sliced.

           Nina?
                         
           Nina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper.
                         
                          NINA
           I'll be out in a second.
                         
           She stays still, hoping she won't try to come in.
                         
           Footsteps recede and Nina breathes.
                         
           She runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood.

           David and Nina dance the Black Swan's Pas de Deux. Once
           again, Nina's rigid and self-conscious.
           51.

           Try it again.
                         
          They resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks
          at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Again.
                         
          The piano music starts up again, and she begins dancing.
                         
          When she finishes, she looks at him, eager for feedback.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Again.
                         
          The music starts up again. Nina stays still, frustrated.
                         
                          NINA
           Do you have any corrections?
                         
                          LEROY
           No.
                         
          She doesn't understand. He gets up from his chair and goes to
          her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Lily talked to me. Said she saw you
           crying.
                         
          Nina looks away. Can't believe Lily talked to him.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           She said you were upset and I
           should "take it easy" on you.
                         
                          NINA
           I didn't tell her that.
                         
                          LEROY
           Maybe you'd like a break for a day
           or two.

           She shouldn't have said anything!
                         
                          LEROY
           I don't care! You shouldn't be
           whining to her!
                         
                          NINA
           I didn't.
                         
                          LEROY
           You could be brilliant. Taking it
           easy would be a betrayal.
                         
           He walks away from her.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

           Hears them chatting in their usual manner.
                         
           Nina KNOCKS loudly at the door, interrupting them.

           And they do.

           You told Thomas about last night?
                         
           Lily falters, guilty.
                         
                          LILY
           I ran into him this morning. He
           said you guys were having some
           trouble.
                         
                          NINA

           Whoa your highness, I just told him
           you're working your ass off and I'm
           sure you'll be great.
                         
                          NINA
           You shouldn't have done that.
                         
                          LILY
           I didn't fucking do anything.
                         
           Lily takes off. Nina stares after her, at a loss.

           Nina sits on the subway, going home. She notices that one of
           her fingernails has a jagged edge. She removes an EMORY BOARD
           from her bag and begins filing it down.
                         
           A SKEEZY MAN across the aisle ogles her.
           54.
                         
           Nina keeps her eyes down, trying to ignore him. He starts to
           sing an OLD LOVE SONG from the 20's.
                         
           Nina stands and goes to the other end of the car. He
           continues singing, undeterred.

           I have a right to be concerned,
           Nina. You've been staying late so
           many nights. "Rehearsing." I hope
           he's not taking advantage, that's
           all.
                         
                          NINA

           as my career was concerned.

           No. 
                         
          Erica starts to come towards her. 
                         
          The DOORBELL RINGS. 
                         
          Erica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head.
           56.
                         
           Erica goes to the door and cracks it open, keeping the chain
           engaged.

           she's not in.
                         
           Erica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was.
                         
                          NINA
           Who was it?
                         
           Erica doesn't answer.
                         
           Irritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door
           to find out.
                         
                          ERICA

           Nina sees a ballerina walking away from the door.
                         
                          NINA
           Hello?
                         
           Lily turns.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey.
                         
                          NINA
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           What are you doing here?
                         
           Nina steps out of her apartment and closes the door.
                         
                          LILY
           I wanted to apologize.
                         
           Nina just stares, incredulous.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           You were right, I shouldn't have
           talked to him about you.
                         
           Erica opens the door and sticks her head out.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sweetheart?
           57.
                         
                          NINA
           Give me a second.
                         
                          ERICA
           Your dinner...
                         
                          NINA
           Mom, please!
                         
          Erica closes the door.
                         
                          LILY
           She's a trip...
                         
                          NINA
           How did you know where I live?
                         
                          LILY
           I have my ways.
                         
          Nina looks at her, darkly.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Relax, I got it from Susie in the
           office. I feel really shitty. Can I
           make it up to you? Take you out to
           dinner?
                         
                          NINA
           I don't think-
                         
                          LILY
           A drink?
                         
          Nina's tempted. Erica pokes her head out again.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sweetie, you need to rest.
                         
                          LILY
           Jesus.
                         
          Nina pushes the elevator call button.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO LILY)
           Wait.
                         
          Nina walks to the door, and grabs her coat.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you doing?
           58.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm going out.
                         
                          ERICA
           What?
                         
           Nina ignores her and shuts the door.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO LILY)
           Let's go.
                         
                         
          61 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 61
                         
           A noisy bar and burger joint, packed to the brim. Lily and
           Nina sit at a small table.
                         
                          LILY
           Can't believe that's what he called
           her. So gross!
                         
                          NINA
           I think it's sweet.
                         
                          LILY
           Little princess? He probably calls
           every girl that.
                         
                          NINA
           Only Beth.
                         
                          LILY
           Well, I'm sure she lost the title
           after her game of chicken.
                         
           Nina's smile fades.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Bet he'll be calling you little
           princes any day now.
                         
                          NINA
           I don't think so.
           59.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure, just gotta let him eat the
           pussy.
                         
          Nina blushes, embarrassed, and Lily cracks up. A WAITER drops
          a plate in front of her.
                         
                          WAITER
                          (TO LILY)
           Cheese burger, extra bloody.
                         
                          LILY
           Danke schoen.
                         
                          WAITER
           Let me know if it's not juicy
           enough.
                         
                          LILY
           Oh, I will.
                         
          He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely
          plops down Nina's plate.
                         
                          WAITER
           Enjoy.
                         
          Lily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed.
                         
                          LILY
           What?
                         
                          NINA
           Guess I'm invisible.
                         
          Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY
          SHIRT.
                         
                          LILY
           Here, wanna spruce up?
                         
          Nina gives her a puzzled look.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I always carry a spare, case I wake
           up somewhere unexpected.
                         
          Lily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite, a
          little grease dripping down her chin. Nina cuts into her dry
          chicken breast.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Not like you need more attention
           these days. How is he?
           60.
                         
          Nina doesn't understand the question.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Thomas?
                         
                          NINA
           I wouldn't know.
                         
                          LILY
           Yeah, right.
                         
                          NINA
           I don't want to talk about it.
                         
                          LILY
           Relax, you're so tense.
                         
          Lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside,
          CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           One for you...
                         
          Lily grabs one of the pills and slides it over.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           And one for me.
                         
          Lily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer.
                         
          Nina stares at her pill, too embarrassed to admit she doesn't
          know what it is.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it
           with me straight from San
           Francisco.
                         
                          NINA
           What is it?
                         
                          LILY
           You're kidding? You never rolled?
                         
          Nina blinks.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Oh boy. It'll just make you have a
           good time. Loosen up. See the night
           sky.
                         
                          NINA
                          (CURIOUS)
           How long does it last?
           61.
                         
                          LILY
           Couple hours. Tops.
                         
           Nina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second...
                         
                          NINA
           That's okay.
                         
                          LILY
           Sure?
                         
           Nina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case
           closed.
                         
                         
          62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62
                         
           Wearing the SKIMPY SHIRT Lily offered her, Nina rinses her
           mouth out with water from the sink, then checks herself out
           in the mirror.
                         
           It's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers. One
           particularly bright one says, "Seize the Day-glo."
                         
           Nina's cell phone RINGS. She checks the ID--"MOM"--and
           silences it.
                         
           Nina puts her SWEATSHIRT back on over the shirt, and exits.
                         
                         
          63 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 63
                         
           Nina returns to her table, but when she gets there, Lily is
           gone and the table is cleared.
                         
           She looks around the crowded room, doesn't see her anywhere.
                         
           She heads towards the exit, and sees Lily at the bar,
           flirting with TWO ATTRACTIVE MEN. She's very touchy-feely.
                         
           Intrigued, Nina stays put, wanting to observe Lily from a
           distance.
                         
           The BARTENDER sets a drink down in front of Lily. The men
           compete to pay for it.
                         
           Lily takes out the CIGARETTE CASE from her purse, and removes
           the pill.
                         
           Nina looks on, suspicious.
                         
           Lily opens the pill, and dumps its contents into the drink.
           She stirs it with her finger.
           62.
                         
          She holds out her finger to one of the men, he sucks off the
          liquid.
                         
          Lily looks over and catches Nina watching. She waves for her
          to join them.
                         
          Nina reluctantly walks to her.
                         
                          LILY
           Heeey, thought we could use some
           drinks.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm gonna go.
                         
                          LILY
           This is Tom and this is Jerry.
                         
          The guys laugh.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Actually it's Andrew.
                         
                          TOM
           Tom.
                         
                          NINA
           Hi.
                         
                          LILY
           You can't leave, I bought you a
           drink.
                         
          Lily holds out the doctored beverage. Nina eyes it, tempted
          to go down the rabbit hole...
                         
                          NINA
           I really shouldn't, we're on the
           stage tomorrow.
                         
                          LILY
           What, you gonna go home to mommy?
           Live a little.
                         
          Nina grins sheepishly and takes the drink. Lily smiles.
                         
                          NINA
           Just a couple of hours?

          Nina takes a tiny sip.

                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Go on.
                         
           Nina takes another sip and smiles.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Let's go sit somewhere a little
           more comfortable. Gentlemen?
                         
           She gets up and holds out her hands. The two men each grab
           one and she leads them deeper into the bar.

           Nina's drink is half gone. The foursome sits snugly at a
           booth. Nina next to Andrew, shyly avoiding his gaze. She
           takes another tentative sip of her drink.
                         
                          ANDREW
           You haven't told me who you are.
                         
                          NINA
           Oh, I'm a dancer.
                         
                          ANDREW
           No, I mean your name.
                         
                          NINA
           Nina.
                         
                          TOM
           You two sisters?

           Yes. No.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Well?
                         
                          LILY
           We're blood sisters.
                         
                          NINA
           We dance in the same company.

           Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you
           look alike.
                         
                          LILY

           Very funny.
                         
                          LILY
           Oh, I just assumed.
                         
                          ANDREW
           I've never been to the ballet.
                         
                          LILY
           In that case you're definitely NOT
           gay.
                         
                          TOM
           It's pretty boring, isn't it?

                          LILY
                          (FLIRTY)
           It's not for everyone. You probably
           aren't sophisticated enough.
                         
                          TOM
           You've got some mouth, you know
           that?
                         
                          LILY
           Isn't that compliment a little
           premature?
                         
          Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously.
                         
                          NINA
           You guys should come sometime. I
           can comp you tickets.
                         
          Tom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness.
                         
                          TOM
           Yeah...that'd be neat.
                         
                          LILY
           I think we all need another round.
           Bottom's up.
                         
          She looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her
          to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties
          her glass.
                         
          She waits for something to kick in.
           65.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Tom, come with me?
                         
          Lily slips out of the booth and Tom follows, leaving Nina and
          Andrew alone. She avoids his gaze, nervous.
                         
                          ANDREW
           So...what are you guys working on
           these days?
                         
          Her cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it
          off and gives him an embarrassed smile.
                         
                          NINA
           Sorry. Swan Lake.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Yeah?
                         
                          NINA
           You know it?
                         
                          ANDREW
           Oh, no, not really. Heard of it
           though. What's it about?
                         
                          NINA
           It's about a girl who's been turned
           into a swan. She needs love to
           break the spell.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Okay.
                         
                          NINA
           Yeah, but her prince falls for the
           wrong girl and she kills herself.
                         
                          ANDREW
           So a happy ending, then?
                         
                          NINA
           It's beautiful, actually.
                         
                          ANDREW
           Like you.
                         
          She starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug.
                         
                          NINA
           Huh?
                         
                          ANDREW
           I said you're beautiful.
           66.
                         
           She giggles.
                         
                          ANDREW (CONT'D)
           That funny?
                         
           She gives him a flirtatious glance.
                         
                          NINA
           My hands are all sweaty.
                         
           Andrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at
           his face. His eyes twinkle at her.
                         
           Lily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her
           body. Lily hugs her back.
                         
                          LILY
           Uh oh! Looks like someone's
           rolling. Let's get you dancing.

           Nina kisses Tom on the floor of a crowded dance club. The
           drug is in full effect.
                         
           The world has soft edges, colors are vivid and bleed into one
           another.
                         
           Lily twirls her around.
                         
           Nina attaches herself to her, hungry for the attention. A
           cheering section of guys surrounds them.
                         
           Nina lets loose. Dances with abandon.
                         
                         
          66 INT. CLUB BATHROOM - LATER 66
                         
           Nina makes out with someone, her back pushed up against the
           wall. Her eyes are closed, she's shiny with sweat.
                         
           She opens her eyes, confused to find that it's not Andrew or
           even Tom, just a STRANGE MAN.
                         
           She backs away. He reaches for her, but she swats him off.

          67 INT. DANCE CLUB - SAME 67
                         
           She stumbles around the dance floor, looking for Lily, but
           only sees a mass of moving bodies.
                         
           She finally spots a girl that looks like her from behind.
           Nina grabs her shoulder and the GIRL spins around. Not Lily.
                         
                         
          68 EXT. DANCE CLUB - LATER 68
                         
           Nina pushes her way out of the club, starting to panic. She
           looks around, trying to figure out where she is, but the city
           is dark and non-descript.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Nina!
                         
           Nina turns towards the voice and, with relief, sees Lily exit
           the club.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Where you goin'?
                         
                         
          69 INT. TAXI - NIGHT 69
                         
           Nina stares adoringly at Lily, who has her eyes closed,
           enjoying the cool air blowing in from her open window.
                         
           Lily opens her eyes and catches Nina staring. Lily smirks.
                         
           Using her index and middle finger as "legs," she "walks" her
           hand over the vinyl seat, all the way to Nina's leg and pokes
           it.
                         
           Nina watches her hand with a smile on her face, glances at
           Lily.
                         
           Lily smiles back, and then "walks" her hand up the leg, until
           it reaches the edge of Nina's dress.
                         
           Lily looks at Nina questioningly. Nina doesn't protest.
                         
           Lily slips her hand underneath the dress, gently makes
           contact...
                         
           Nina shudders, but pulls Lily's hand back out and holds it.
                         
           Lily snickers and looks out her window.
                         
           Nina looks at their clasped hands, then out her own window,
           happy.

           Nina quietly opens the front door.
                         
           Lily GIGGLES. Nina SHUSHES her.
                         
           They slip off their shoes and tip-toe inside.

           Lily taps her on the shoulder and points towards the hallway.
                         
           Erica emerges from the darkness, approaching them slowly.
           Distraught.

           Ding ding ding.
                         
           Lily snickers, Nina tries to keep a straight face, but ends
           up laughing.

                          ERICA
           What else have you been doing?
                         
           Nina smiles coyly.
                         
                          NINA

                          NINA
           There were two. Tom and Jerry...
                         
                          ERICA
           Be quiet, Nina.
                         
                          NINA
                          (GIGGLING)
           I fucked both of them.
                         
                          ERICA
           Shut your mouth!
                         
           Erica violently jams her fingers over Nina's lips, trying to
           silence her.
                         
           Nina runs into her room and SLAMS the door.
                         
                         
          72A INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - SAME 72A
                         
           She grabs the broken PIECE OF WOOD from the dresser and jams
           the door. She backs Lily away, preparing for the storm.
                         
                          NINA
           Don't come in here!
                         
           Erica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers
           her eye through the crack.
                         
                          ERICA
           What's this?
                         
                          NINA
           It's called privacy! I'm not
           fucking twelve years old anymore!
                         
           Erica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to
           budge.
                         
                          ERICA
           You're not my Nina right now!
           70.
                         
                          NINA
           LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
                         
           Nina SHOVES the door shut.
                         
           Erica's FOOTSTEPS retreat, followed by the SLAM of her
           bedroom door.
                         
          72B Nina is worked up, breathing hard. 72B
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Whoa...
                         
           Nina turns around and sees her Double smiling at her.
                         
           Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that
           it's actually Lily.
                         
           Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up.
                         
           Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other,
           passion exceeding coordination.
                         
           Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed.
                         
           She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously.
                         
           Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina.
                         
           Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one.
                         
           Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash.
                         
           There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin
           pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand.
                         
           Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists
           down.
                         
           She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence.
                         
           She digs her nails into Nina's hands.
                         
           Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on
           her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings.
                         
           She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further...
           71.
                         
           Lily starts to go down on Nina.
                         
           Nervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE.
                         
           She tries to pull away.
                         
           LILY shushes her.
                         
           Nina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a
           breath and succumbs.
                         
           Bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens.
                         
           She closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body
           and CLIMAXES.
                         
           She breathes her way back to earth. Slowly her eyes open.
           She rolls over towards Lily. But Lily is gone.
                         
           Instead her DOUBLE hovers over her.
                         
                          DOUBLE
           Sweet girl.
                         
           She SMASHES a pillow over Nina's face.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          73 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 73
                         
           Nina lies alone in bed, the sheets and comforter in disarray.
                         
           She sits up, clutches her head in pain.
                         
           She looks around, but there's no sign of Lily or the Double.
                         
           Then her eyes drift to the alarm clock: 11:36.
           72.
                         
           She snaps out of bed.
                         
                         
          74 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - MORNING 74
                         
           Dishevelled, Nina races towards the front door. She sees
           Erica brooding at the kitchen table, watching her.
                         
                          NINA
           Why didn't you wake me up?
                         
           Erica just stares at her, devastated.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'm moving out.
                         
           Nina whips out the front door and leaves her.
                         
                         
          75 INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY 75
                         
           Nina races. She hears muffled Black Swan music playing,
           rehearsal clearly in progress.
                         
                          NINA
                          (TO HERSELF)
           My music.
                         
           She runs into the wings and sees the full company rehearsing
           on stage for the first time...
                         
           Another girl dancing her part.
                         
           The girl spins and Nina sees her face. It's Lily!
                         
           Horrified, Nina runs onto
                         
                         
                         76 STAGE 76
                         
           and makes a beeline for Leroy, looking beyond apologetic.
                         
           The dancers and piano player stop at the interruption.
                         
                          LEROY
           Keep going. Let's finish the Act.
                         
           The piano music resumes, and the dancers pick up where they
           left off.
           73.
                         
          Nina meets Lily's eyes. She makes a sorry face, but then
          continues dancing.
                         
          Nina is forced to watch from the sidelines as Lily and David
          finish the Black Swan's Pas de Deux.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           That was good. Let's take 10, then
           we'll move on to Act 4.
                         
          He turns to Nina and his smile fades.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Get warmed up.

           Thomas, I'm sor-
                         
          He ignores her, and walks off stage.
                         
          Lily tentatively approaches with the PRACTICE TUTU.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey...
                         
          Nina snatches it, avoiding eye contact. She puts it on.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           He wanted to go through the
           spacing. Asked me to step in.
                         
          Nina starts stretching.
                         
                          NINA
                          (LOADED)
           I overslept.
                         
                          LILY
           Oops... Least you had a good time,
           right?
                         
          Nina doesn't answer.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
                          NINA
           You put something in my drink.

                          NINA
           And took off this morning.
                         
                          LILY

                          NINA
           Yeah, you slept over.
                         
                          LILY
           Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and
           you have a dick.
                         
                          NINA
           But we...
                         
          Nina stops herself.
                         
                          LILY
           We what, Nina?
                         
          Lily can read something on her face.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           What, you have some kind of lezzy
           wet dream?
                         
          Nina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard.
                         
                          NINA
           You're lying.
                         
                          LILY
                          (TICKLED)
           Oh my god, you totally fantasized
           about me.
                         
                          NINA
           Stop.
                         
                          LILY
           Was I good?

                          (BARKS)
           Shut up!
                         
          Other dancers look over.
                         
          Nina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away.

           Nina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide.
                         
                          LEROY
           The Black Swan has stolen your
           love. There's only one way to end
           the pain.
                         
           Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff,"
           stopping at the precipice.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You're not at all fearful. Filled
           with acceptance.
                         
           Nina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a
           HARD FLOOR surrounds it.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           You look at the Prince, then down
           at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the
           audience...And jump!
                         
           She hesitates, fearful.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Go ahead. You'll be fine.
                         
           Nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive.
                         
           She falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause
           from the other dancers.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Everybody get a drink then it's
           notes.
                         
           Nina lies in the pads, completely exhausted.

           Nina sits backstage, toweling herself off.
                         
           She pauses, noticing Leroy and Lily conversing near the
           doorway.
                         
           Lily nods and touches his arm. He smiles warmly, then notices
           Nina watching. His serious demeanor returns and he pulls
           away. He says goodbye to Lily.
                         
           Lily follows his gaze and smirks at Nina, rubbing it in,
           before exiting herself.

          A81 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A81
                         
           Nina kneels in front of the toilet, a finger down her throat.
           She gags, but nothing comes up.
                         
           Her eyes tear up, and she tries again, but still just heaves.
                         
           Frustrated, she wipes her mouth and flushes.
                         
                         
          81 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 81
                         
           Nina exits the bathroom and approaches her mother's bedroom
           door. It's closed, but the light's on underneath.
                         
           She's about to knock, but hesitates. Through the door, she
           can hear the sound of her mother watching an INFOMERCIAL on
           TV. An unfamiliar, lonely noise.
                         
           Nina stands there for a moment, just breathing. She
           strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door.
                         
                         
          82 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 82
                         
           Nina collapses on her bed.
                         
           She opens the JEWELRY BOX sitting on her night stand.
                         
           She watches the ballerina spin for a moment...
                         
           Then suddenly SLAMS the lid shut and throws the box hard
           against the wall.
                         
           She shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish
           possessions--stuffed animals, dolls, keepsakes, etc.
                         
                         
          83 INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 83
                         
           Nina shoves her belongings into the TRASH CHUTE, a pile of
           her next victims strewn at her feet.
                         
           She grabs a TEDDY BEAR IN A TUTU, and jams him in.
           77-78A.
                         
          A84 INT. STAGE - DAY A84
                         
           Nina dances the Black Swan in front of the nearly completed
           scenery.
                         
           A few TECHNICIANS complete last minute touch-ups.
                         
           Leroy watches from his down-stage post, his focus split
           between her and...
                         
           Lily, stretching with the other ballerinas. She stares at
           Nina with a dark expression.
                         
           Fueled by the competition, Nina pushes herself. Her dancing
           becomes more impassioned and aggressive.
                         
           She finishes the section, breathing deeply, covered in sweat.
           The company enthusiastically claps.
                         
           She stares intently at Leroy, awaiting his response.
                         
                          LEROY
           At last, I saw the Black Swan.
                         
                         
          B84 INT. COSTUME SHOP - DAY B84
                         
           Nina wears the BLACK SWAN COSTUME, facing a mirror. Another
           mirror behind her creates an infinite array of reflections.
                         
           The overworked COSTUMER checks each seam, pulling the costume
           taut, analyzing what needs to be taken in and let out.
                         
           Nina looks uncomfortable, disliking the scrutiny of her body.
                         
           She hears a sharp RUSTLE. Like someone's scratching.
                         
           She looks up at the mirror. Her reflection stares back.
                         
           Behind the first reflection, another Nina has her arm behind
           her back, like she's scratching her shoulder.
                         
           Nina leans to get a better look...
                         
                          COSTUMER
           Sit still, I'm almost done.
                         
           Nina startles. The reflection has returned to normal, its
           hand back at its side.
                         
           Costumer checks one more thing, makes one more note.
                         
                          COSTUMER (CONT'D)
           Okay, all set.
           77-78B.
                         
           The costumer leaves her to change.
                         
           Relieved, Nina quickly takes off the costume and starts to
           dress in her sweats.
                         
           She hears someone enter the costume shop.
                         
           LILY (O.S.)
           Hey...Thomas sent me.
                         
           Nina pauses, recognizing her voice.
                         
           COSTUMER (O.S.)
           Yeah, need to get you measured for
           your Swan Queen costumes.
                         
           Nina steps out from behind the privacy curtain, and finds
           Lily waiting.
                         
                          NINA

           He made me your alternate.
           (can't help it)
           Just in case...
                         
           Nina pushes past her.
                         
                         
          C84 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY C84
                         
           Nina chases after Leroy, in mid-conversation with the STAGE
           MANAGER and two STAGEHANDS.
                         
                          NINA
           Thomas!
                         
           He stops and faces her.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           She's trying to replace me.

           They continue walking.

                          NINA
           Lily. You made her my alternate.

                          NINA
           No, she's different. She's after
           me. She's trying to replace me.
                         
                          LEROY

                          NINA
           Please believe me.
                         
           He studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this.
                         
                          LEROY
           Listen, I know it's been a
           struggle. But you had a
           breakthrough this morning.
                         
           Nina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow is yours. Give a great
           performance, and you won't have to
           worry about Lily, or anyone else.

           No more. Go home and rest.
                         
           Shut down, she watches him walk away.

           Nina practices the Black Swan, alone with the jaded piano
           player, working herself hard.
                         
           He suddenly stops playing.
                         
                          NINA
           What happened?
                         
                          PIANO PLAYER
           I gotta life, deary.
                         
           He closes the music book and stands.
                         
           PIANO PLAYER (CONT'D)
           Don't work too hard. It's your big
           day tomorrow.
                         
           Annoyed, she watches him leave.
                         
          85B She faces herself in the mirror and takes a breath. 85B
                         
           She resumes dancing without music, her feet CLICKING on the
           floor.
                         
           As she moves, she notices something strange out of the corner
           of her eye:
                         
           The reflection's dancing lags a little behind hers.
                         
           Nina stops. The sound of her footsteps stops a second later.
           She stares at the mirror...troubled.
                         
           The door to the room BANGS shut.
                         
           She whips towards it and she's suddenly plunged into
           DARKNESS.
                         
           Freaked, she stumbles towards the door, and pushes out into
                          THE
           80.
                         
          86A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 86A
                         
           Where it's equally dark. Lit only by the stage's "ghost
           light," a single bulb on a stand.
                         
                          NINA
           Hey! Hey! I'm still in here.
                         
           No one answers.
                         
           She looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty
           seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming...
                         
           She hears a noise in the wings.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Hey! Turn the lights back on!
                         
           She gets to the other side of the stage, but the wings seem
           empty. Quiet.
                         
          86B Then she hears the faint sound of MUFFLED BANGING. 86B
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
           No one answers.
                         
           She heads towards the noise. The banging now accompanied by a
           GIGGLE.
                         
                         
          87 INT. WINGS - SAME 87
                         
           It's pretty dark but the sound is unmistakable: two people
           going at it.
                         
           Nina tiptoes past some off-stage SETS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT.
                         
           And peeks around a piece of SCENERY...
                         
           Catching a glimpse of Leroy fucking Lily further backstage.
           She's wild, clearly enjoying it.
                         
           Nina looks away, disgusted. She peeks back one more time.
                         
           Leroy has become the demon Rothbart, ravishing the Double.
           She meets Nina's eyes and smiles.
                         
           Nina jumps back, knocking into a piece of the set. The
           lovemaking pauses at the sound.
                         
           Nina flees.

          A88 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT A88
                         
           Nina runs in and quickly jams her belongings into her bag.
                         
           She notices her reflection in the mirror and removes her
           diamond earrings.
                         
           Then gathers the other trinkets sitting on the counter and
           puts them all inside her bag.
                         
                         
          B88 EXT. THEATER - NIGHT B88
                         
           Nina pushes out the stage door, and passes the ROW OF
           POSTERS.
                         
           They now advertise Swan Lake and feature a beautiful
           photograph of Nina.
                         
           Nina stops and looks at them.
                         
                         
          88 INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 88
                         
           Nina slowly enters Beth's room, but remains at the threshold.
                         
           Beth sits in a wheelchair faced towards the window. Sleeping.
                         
           Nina gets up the nerve and quietly walks further in, trying
           not to wake her.
                         
           Nina pulls out the tube of lipstick from her bag and gently
           places it on the hospital table.
                         
           She pulls out the diamond earrings, sets them down.
                         
           Followed by the makeup compact, the pack of cigarettes, a
           needle and thread, and an emory board.
                         
           A hand suddenly GRABS Nina's arm.
                         
           Awake, Beth stares Nina down.
                         
                          BETH
           What are you doing here?
                         
           Stunned, Nina's unable to answer.
                         
           Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table.
                         
                          NINA
           I'm so sorry.
                         
           Beth begins touching the objects, vaguely remembering.
           82.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I didn't mean to make you feel this
           way. It's happening to me now.
           She's trying to replace me.
                         
          Beth sees the earrings and it all clicks in.
                         
                          BETH
           You stole all these things?
                         
                          NINA
           I just wanted to be like you.
           Perfect.
                         
          Beth shoots Nina a dark look and turns away.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm not perfect. I'm nothing.
                         
                          NINA
           It's not true.
                         
                          BETH
           Fucking nothing!
                         
          Beth grabs the emory board and stabs herself in the face.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Nothing! Nothing!!!
                         
                          NINA
           Beth?!
                         
          Nina spins Beth around. She is now a bloody version of THE
          DOUBLE! She continues stabbing herself.
                         
          Nina grabs the Double's hand and struggles to restrain her.
                         
                          DOUBLE
           NOTHING!
                         
                          NINA
           Stop it! Stop!
                         
          The emory board stabs into Nina's arm.
                         
          Nina rushes from the room.
           83.
                         
          89 INT. HALLWAY - SAME 89
                         
           She BANGS into a empty stretcher sitting in the hallway,
           causing a CLAMOR.
                         
           The older nurse looks up.
                         
           Nina jumps into an open elevator.
                         
                         
          90 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - SAME 90
                         
           She hits the GROUND FLOOR BUTTON, and hides in the corner.
                         
           As the doors close, she looks down and sees that, in one
           hand, she holds the BLOODY EMORY BOARD.
                         
           She drops it, disgusted.
                         
                         
          91 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 91
                         
           Nina runs in and quickly shuts the door behind her. Takes a
           breath, and notices some blood still on her hands.
                         
                         
          A92 INT. KITCHEN - SAME A92
                         
           She flips on the light. The room's empty.
                         
           She goes to the sink and washes her hands.
                         
           She finishes, and flips the light off as she walks out of the
           room.
                         
           She pauses, rushes back and flips on the light. The Double
           stares at her from the corner, her face covered in blood.
           Terrified, Nina runs.
                         
                         
          B92 INT. BATHROOM - SAME B92
                         
           She goes straight to the toilet and VOMITS.
                         
           She hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards
           the open door.
                         
                          NINA
           Mommy?!
                         
           She goes out to investigate.
           83A.
                         
          92 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME 92
                         
           Nina flings open the door, but Erica's not in there.
                         
           She hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING.
                         
           Nina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to
           move slightly. Blink. Mouths move.
                         
           They whisper: "Sweet girl" and then start chanting "My turn,
           my turn, my turn!"
                         
           Nina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out.
                         
           She hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there.
                         
           She glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She
           sees her Double rushing towards the room.
                         
           Scared, Nina whips around, just as her mother arrives in the
           doorway.
           84.
                         
                          ERICA
           What are you doing?
                         
           Nina pushes past her, in a frenzy.
                         
                         
          93 INT. BEDROOM - SAME 93
                         
           Nina closes the door. Sticks in the broken piece of wood.
                         
           A pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS,
           instinctively reaching for it.
                         
           She quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity
           mirror.
                         
           Her back pulsates unnaturally. Tiny black tips poke through.
                         
           The door opens and catches on the doorjamb.
                         
           Erica starts POUNDING.
                         
                          NINA
           GO AWAY!
                         
           She digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her
           fingernails.
                         
                          ERICA
           Open the door!!!
                         
           Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood.
                         
           Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks.
                         
           Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red.
                         
           Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY
           BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps
           hang off of it.
                         
           The door flings open.
                         
           Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Oh my god...
                         
           Nina starts forcing her out the door. Erica pushes back.
           85.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Stop, you're sick!
                         
                          NINA
           Get OUT!
                         
           She manages to get her all the way out the door.
                         
           But ROTHBART'S HAND grabs the door frame.
                         
           Nina SLAMS the door, SMASHING the hand.
                         
           Erica SCREAMS in pain.
                         
           Nina slams the door again, and again. The hand now human.
                         
           She finally gets the door all the way shut.
                         
           She steps away from it, nervous...
                         
           She looks down, sees one of her knees SNAP backwards, like
           that of a bird. Then the other knee SNAPS back.
                         
           Nina stumbles and falls.
                         
           And SLAMS her head into the radiator.
                         
           SMASH TO BLACK.
                         
           TINNY MUSIC plays in the darkness.
                         
                          FADE IN:
                         
                         
          94 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - EVENING 94
                         
           Nina flutters open her eyes. The world comes into focus and
           she sees her mother hovering over her, stroking her hair.
                         
                          ERICA
           Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here.
                         
           Nina looks around, disoriented. Sees her hands jammed inside
           thick socks, held on by rubber bands. Groggy, she tries to
           pull them off.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           You were scratching all night.
                         
           Erica helps remove the socks, her smashed hand wrapped in
           bandages.
                         
           Nina weakly tries to sit up, but Erica pushes her back down.
           86.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Rest. Shhh, rest.
                         
          Nina gives in, too tired to fight her. Her eyes drift to the
          source of the tinny music: the open jewelry box. The
          ballerina's been broken off, all that remains is a single
          amputated leg, spinning morbidly on the base.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           That's good. Rest.
                         
          Nina's eyes drift to the alarm clock. It's gone.
                         
                          NINA
           Where's the clock?
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't worry.
                         
          Nina looks at the dark window.
                         
                          NINA
           It's dark. What night is it?
                         
          Nina reads Erica's face. Reality clicks in.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
                          (PANICKING)
           What time is it?!
                         
          Nina tries to sit up, but her mother pushes her back down.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I have to go.
                         
                          ERICA
           Don't worry. I called the theater
           and told them you weren't feeling
           well.
                         
          Nina freaks, struggles more violently.
                         
                          NINA
           No, I want to.
                         
                          ERICA
           Lie down!
                         
                          NINA
           Get off me!
                         
          Nina squirms free of Erica's grasp and gets out of bed. She
          gets to the door...
           87.
                         
          But the doorknob's been knocked-off, leaving just a metal
          post sticking out of the hole.
                         
                          ERICA
           We're staying in here until you
           feel better.
                         
          Nina grips the metal post and pulls and pulls, shaking the
          door.
                         
                          NINA
           Where is it?
                         
          Erica calmly sits down in her CHAIR, waiting for the storm to
          pass.
                         
                          ERICA
           This role is destroying you.
                         
          Nina rifles through her dresser drawers.
                         
          She notices her mother sitting calmly.
                         
                          NINA
           Move.
                         
                          ERICA
           Nina...
                         
          Nina grabs her by the wrist.
                         
                          ERICA (CONT'D)
           Stop it.
                         
                          NINA
           You're crazy!
                         
                          ERICA
           What happened to my sweet girl?
                         
          Nina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor.
                         
                          NINA
           She's gone.
                         
                          ERICA
           Please, you're not well.
                         
          Under the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB.
                         
          Erica lunges for her daughter's legs.
                         
                          NINA
           Let go!
           87A.
                         
                          ERICA
           You can't handle it!
                         
                          NINA
           I can't?! I'm the fucking swan
           queen! You never even got out of
           the corps.
                         
                          ERICA
           You fucking ungrateful-
                         
          Nina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door.
                         
           ERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Don't leave! Nina!
           88.
                         
          95 EXT. THEATER - EVENING 95
                         
           Nina approaches the theater with harried steps.
                         
           Quickly past the row of SWAN LAKE posters.
                         
           She reaches the side of the building, flings open the stage
           door and enters.
                         
                         
          96 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - EVENING 96
                         
           Nina frantically makes her way down the bustling hallway,
           chaotic with dancers. Excitement in the air.
                         
           She nears the soloists' dressing room.
                         
           Just outside of it, she spots a group of DANCERS excitedly
           chatting around a smiling Lily.
                         
           Nina stops in her tracks.
                         
           Lily glances in her direction, and her smile quickly fades
           into a sneer.
                         
                          LILY
           What are you doing here?
                         
           The other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their
           smiles turn to confusion.
                         
           LEROY (O.S.)
           Nina?
                         
           She turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind
           her.
                         
                          LILY
           You're supposed to be sick.
                         
                          LEROY
           Lily, give us a minute.
                         
           Leroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she
           passes.
                         
                         
          97 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 97
                         
           Leroy closes the door behind them. He looks at Nina, wheels
           spinning.
           89.
                         
                          LEROY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          NINA
           I'm fine.
                         
          Nina goes to her wardrobe, finds her two costumes hanging.
          One for the White Swan, one for the Black Swan.
                         
                          LEROY
           Nina?
                         
          She doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and
          sets it on her chair.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           Nina!
                         
                          NINA
           What?
                         
                          LEROY
           I already asked Lily-
                         
                          NINA
           Fuck. Have you announced it?
                         
          He hasn't.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           After Beth, do you need more
           controversy?
                         
          Leroy smirks at her directness.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it.
                         
          He looks at her, considering, and gives her a reluctant nod.
          She smiles.
           90.
                         
                          LEROY
           The only person standing in your
           way is you. It's time to let her
           go. Lose yourself.
                         
           She nods. He takes one last look at her and leaves. She
           breathes a sigh of relief.
                         
           Curious, she cracks open the door and peeks outside:
                         
                         
          98 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY (NINA'S POV) 98
                         
           Leroy has pulled Lily down the corridor to break the news.
           Lily takes off, furious.
                         
                         
                         99 OMITTED 99
           91.
                         
          100 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - LATER 100
                         
           Through the PA, music from ACT 1 plays.
                         
           Nina sits at her vanity in a robe, wearing the full White
           Swan makeup and FEATHER CROWN. Pale, with red lipstick and
           dark eyeliner, she looks like a porcelain doll.
                         
           She drops the robe off her shoulder and covers her rash with
           white makeup.
                         
           The STAGE MANAGER'S voice comes through the PA speaker:
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
           Act 2's starting. Ten minutes.
                         
           She removes a slipper off one foot. Her big and second toe,
           and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together. Puzzled, she
           peels them apart.
                         
           She removes her other slipper and finds the same toes
           completely FUSED, forming two large toes with double toenails
           on either side of the middle toe.
                         
           She touches the bird-like foot, concerned, but slips on her
           tights and hides the feet.
                         
                         
          101 INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 101
                         
           Nina stretches nervously in the wings, awaiting her entrance.
                         
           She peeks out through a small hole in the wall, sees the
           AUDIENCE sitting expectantly in their seats.
                         
           The music begins and they shift and mummer in anticipation.
                         
           Nina pulls away, taking deep breaths and clenching her hands,
           trying to stay calm.
                         
           On stage, David enters, beginning the Act. He traverses the
           stage, "hunting" with a crossbow.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
                          (TO NINA)
           Go.
                         
           Nina takes a last breath and runs on.
                         
                         
                         102 STAGE 102
                         
           Under the spotlight, she begins dancing her intro.
           92.
                         
           David runs towards her and she startles away from him,
           afraid.
                         
           He grabs her and they begin their first Pas de Deux.
                         
                         
          103 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 103
                         
           Nina comes offstage, catching her breath. All around her,
           CORPS MEMBERS dressed as little swans rush back on stage,
           where FOUR LITTLE SWANS begin the Pas de Quatre.
                         
           Nina looks into the opposite wing and sees Leroy watching
           her. He gives her a small, contented nod, then disappears
           behind a swarm of dancers.
                         
           On stage, the Four Little Swans perform. In their identical
           makeup and costumes, they look disturbingly alike.
                         
           During the applause, Nina catches a glimpse of David
           backstage, sweaty, laughing and holding someone's hands. Nina
           can't see who, her view obscured by moving bodies and limbs.
                         
           Suspicious, Nina moves to get a better look.
                         
           Revealing that David's flirting with Lily.
                         
           Nina tenses.
                         
           Then the Four Little Swans rush offstage past Nina. She
           watches them go, unsettled.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           What are you doing? You're on!
                         
           He gently nudges her, and she has to run back on.
                         
                         
                         104 STAGE 104
                         
           Nina rushes from the wings, directly into David's arms.
                         
           All the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the
           stage, looking downstage.
                         
           David launches Nina into the air, hands around her waist.
           93.
                         
           He slowly turns her around, keeping her held high.
                         
           From her swirling, bird's eye view, Nina sees the rows of
           identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her...
                         
           Nina freaks, jerking her body.
                         
           David's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage.
                         
           It's a horrific moment that feels like an eternity.
                         
           Gritting her teeth, Nina looks up around her, sees the faces
           of the other ballerinas. Staring at her sadistically.
                         
           Nina finds Lily, glancing at David. He snaps to and quickly
           helps Nina up.
                         
                          DAVID
           What the fuck?
                         
           She's too freaked to respond.
                         
           They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together.
                         
           Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit.
           The Little Swans start swirling off stage.
                         
           Leaving Nina and David alone.
                         
           David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand
           of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan.
                         
           She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she
           disappears into the wings.
                         
                         
          105 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 105
                         
           As soon as she's off, she breaks down, hyperventilating. The
           dancer playing ROTHBART eyes her with concern.
                         
                          ROTHBART
           You alright?
                         
           She looks up, sees his creepy MASK, and backs away.
                         
           Rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act.
                         
           Other CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping "You okay?, "What
           happened?" etc.
                         
           Dazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak
           smattering of applause.
           94.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           That's intermission! Act 3 in
           fifteen.
                         
           The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her.
                         
           Nina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed
           curtain.
                         
           David spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away.
                         
           Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina.
                         
           Nina cautiously approaches.
                         
                          NINA
           It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
                         
           He can't even look at her.

           What a fucking disaster!
                         
           He walks away.
                         
           All alone, Nina sees everyone backstage looking at her.
                         
           She runs, escaping their stares.

           She closes the door behind her, ready to cry.
                         
           She looks up, and finds Lily putting on makeup and wearing
           the Black Swan costume.
                         
                          LILY
           Rough start, huh? Pretty
           humiliating...

                          NINA
           Get out of here.
                         
                          LILY
           Wow...rude.
                         
          Lily coyly smiles, and continues applying makeup.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           I'm worried about the next act. Not
           sure you're feeling up to it.
                         
                          NINA
           Stop. Just stop.
                         
                          LILY
           How about...I dance the Black Swan
           for you?
                         
          Nina looks into the mirror. Instead of Lily's reflection
          there's the Double.
                         
                          NINA
           Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
                         
                          DOUBLE
                          (IN MIRROR)
           But it's my turn.
                         
          Nina's fury rises up from inside.
                         
                          NINA
           Leave me alone!!!
                         
          She charges...
                         
          And smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR, shattering it.
          Shards fall everywhere.
                         
          The Double flips Nina over and wails on her. Punch after
          punch.
                         
          Nina does her best to block the onslaught.
                         
          They scuffle, knocking things over, bumping into walls.
                         
          The Double gets her hands around Nina's neck...
                         
          Gasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's
          too strong.
           96.
                         
           Her hands frantically scramble along the surface of the
           floor. The fingers barely touch the edge of a MIRROR SHARD,
           but can't grasp it.
                         
           The Double squeezes down.
                         
           The blood vessels in Nina's eyes BURST again. Her neck starts
           to stretch unnaturally. Strength surges through her body and
           she lunges...
                         
           Finally grabbing the SHARD.
                         
           And DRIVES it into the Double's stomach.
                         
           Nina glances at her hand, cut by the mirror, then back up.
                         
           The Double is now LILY. Stunned, Lily looks down and touches
           the stab wound.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           It's my turn.
                         
           Lily coughs up blood and collapses, dead.
                         
           Nina stares at her, breathing heavily, high on adrenaline.
                         
           A KNOCK on the door.

           Nina drags the stiffening body into the wardrobe closet.

           Nina zips up the back to the Black Swan costume.
                         
           She deliberately applies the Black Swan makeup. Dark eye
           shadow and rouge, maroon lipstick.
                         
           Dressed in black and wearing the dark make-up of the Black
           Swan, she looks fierce.
                         
           She stares at her reflection, her eyes burning RED. New
           rash bumps pop up on her arms, the intensity building within.

           Nina bursts onto stage as the Black Swan, accompanied by
           Rothbart.
                         
           She looks powerful, intense as she moves towards David.
                         
           His face shows his surprise.
                         
           Nina dances the first Pas de Deux with him. They finish and
                          EXIT

           She walks away from him.
                         
           Alone, she looks at her arms, sees black points trying to
           push through again.
                         
           Some fully emerge as shiny BLACK FEATHERS.
                         
           She just watches them, not panicking, but accepting the
           transformation taking place. Even beckoning it.
                         
           Her second entrance cue is played.
                         
                          STAGE MANAGER
           That's you!
                         
           She leaps back on
                         
                         
          111C STAGE 111C
                         
           For the Coda. She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes once
           more, and then completely lets herself go.
                         
           She spins with ferocity. More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from
           her shoulders and back.
                         
           At last, she truly embodies the Black Swan.
           98.
                         
           She finishes the Coda, punctuating her last spin with a sharp
           step that echoes through the theater.
                         
           The audience looks on, mesmerized. Too stunned to clap at
           first.
                         
          111D Nina looks down at the stage, her face glazed with sweat 111D
                         
           She has returned to normal. No feathers. Normal eyes. A
           woman.
                         
           She finally looks up at the audience, and they ERUPT in a
           standing ovation.
                         
           Nina walks to the front of the stage, takes her bow.
                         
           Nina looks up at the MASS OF BODIES filling the auditorium,
           vibrating with applause.
                         
           Proud, Nina smiles and bows again. Again and again.
                         
           She finally runs off stage, the applause still going strong.

           Nina enters the wings, other dancers cheer loudly. Even
           Veronica and Galina.
                         
           She pushes past all the smiling faces. It feels very
           surreal.
                         
           She sees Leroy clapping and shaking his head. Blown away.
                         
                          LEROY
           Get back out there! Get back-
                         
           She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you
           can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant.
                         
           Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but
           before he can say anything...
                         
           She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's
           been run over by a truck.
                         
                         
          113 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER 113
                         
           She walks towards her dressing room, a satisfied smile on her
           face.
                         
           She passes the stage manager.

                          STAGE MANAGER
           Great job. You got fifteen til the
           last act.
                         
           She nods and arrives at her room.
                         
           She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters
           quickly.

           She closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the
           broken glass all over the floor.
                         
           She eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from
           under the door.
                         
           She picks up a towel and lays it over the blood.
                         
           She starts to undress.
                         
                         
          115 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 115
                         
           Back in the White Swan costume, she re-applies the makeup.
                         
           There's a KNOCK on the door. She looks towards it, her face
           only halfway made-up.
                         
                          NINA
           One second.
                         
           She goes to the door, opens it just a crack.
                         
           She peeks through and finds...
                         
           LILY looking back at her.
                         
                          LILY
           Hey...you were amazing.
                         
           Nina's petrified.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Seriously. I'm sorry things got so
           messed up between us. Just, holy
           shit, totally blown away...
           100.
                         
          Nina barely manages a nod.
                         
                          LILY (CONT'D)
           Anyway, wanted to tell you. I'll
           let you finish. Merde.
                         
          Lily turns and walks away.
                         
          Nina swiftly shuts the door.
                         
          She turns around, stares at the wardrobe.
                         
          She steps cautiously towards it, her face repeated
          countlessly in all the reflective shards.
                         
          She lifts the towel from the ground and looks at it.
                         
          It is clean. No blood. She looks down at the floor. No blood
          there either.
                         
          She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
                         
          And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
                         
          She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
          staring back at her.
                         
          She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
                         
          She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
          hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
                         
          It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
          red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
                         
          She feels inside for confirmation.
                         
          And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
                         
          She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
          Blood begins flowing more rapidly.
                         
          She drops the mirror.
                         
           STAGE MANAGER (V.O.)
           (On the PA)
           White Swan in 5.
                         
          In a daze, she sits down at the vanity, and finishes applying
          the rest of the White Swan's makeup.
           101.
                         
          116A INT. STAGE - LATER 116A
                         
           Nina dances the final Pas de Deux as the White Swan. Losing
           blood by the second, everything is woozy and blurry.
                         
           She can't do all the steps, but her performance is pained,
           making it poignant.
                         
           A spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her
           costume.
                         
           The music turns ominous, and VON ROTHBART, the evil sorcerer,
           comes onto stage.
                         
           Nina dances away from him, back upstage, towards the cliff.
           It's time for her final leap.
                         
           Her energy fading, she teeters up the stairs of the set. One
           step at a time...
                         
           She gets to the top, takes one last look around, at all the
           eyes watching her.
                         
           She notices a familiar face in the audience: HER MOTHER. She
           watches with a profound sadness, tears streaking her cheeks.
                         
           In the front of Nina's costume, a dark circle has started to
           form. Her blood fully seeping through.
                         
           And Nina leaps...
                         
          116B INTO BLACKNESS 116B
                         
           She falls through an endless void, her eyes closed.
                         
           She slowly twists around in the air, so that she's falling
           backwards.
                         
           She hears something. Soft and muffled.
                         
           The faint sound of applause.
                         
          116C She lands slowly and comfortably on PADDING. 116C
                         
           The sound of applause is now loud, uproarious.
                         
           A group of BALLERINAS surround the mattress, clapping for
           her, each one dressed as a WHITE SWAN.
                         
           Leroy pushes through the group to get to her.
                         
                          LEROY
           Listen to them! They love you! Get
           up, get up!
                          (MORE)
           102.
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           I always knew you had it in you,
           little princess. Go take your bow!
                         
          Nina is too weak to move.
                         
          Lily pushes her way into the group and GASPS, pointing at
          Nina's abdomen.
                         
          Leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood, which
          has grown in size.
                         
                          LEROY (CONT'D)
           What did you do?
                         
                          NINA
           I felt it.
                         
                          LEROY
           Oh my god.
                         
                          NINA
           ...perfect.
                         
                          LEROY
           Someone, get help.
                         
                          NINA
           Shhh...
                         
          Leroy looks back at her. She smiles.
                         
                          NINA (CONT'D)
           It was perfect.
                         
          He understands.
                         
          The APPLAUSE grows more and more faint. Her eyes glaze over
          and everything goes completely SILENT.
                         
          Nina lies there motionless, a smile frozen on her face.
                         
          CUT TO BLACK.
