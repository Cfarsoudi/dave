        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1

        THE EYE                                                 2

        It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "LEON" it says on
        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I
                  take tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  Already had I.Q. test this year --
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                         (cutting in)
                  Reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  Answer
                  quickly as you can.

        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                LEON
                  What one?

        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  What desert?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  So you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling
                  towards you...

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're
                  not helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!
                  Why is that, Leon?

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        FIRES at the machine on the table.

        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.

        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3

        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end, of the beginning of a day.

        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4

        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,
        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
        the passenger half way down.

        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.

        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5

        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the
        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6

        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
        closer and peers through the glass.

        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN
        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.

        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7

        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-
        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8

        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his
        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light.

        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9

        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows
        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  It was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours
                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit
                  with an Eskimo lady in North East
                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to
                  make.  It was so good, I didn't
                  want to leave, so I left a day
                  early.

        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                DECKARD
                  Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
                  calling Com-fast 27.

        The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                VOICE
                  Blade Runner One, stand by please.

        A pause.  Followed by a husky male voice.

                                VOICE
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Yah, Gaff.

                                GAFF (VOICE)
                  Where the hell you been?

                                DECKARD
                  You know where I been.  I been on
                  vacation.

                                GAFF
                  Next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                DECKARD
                  What's up?

                                GAFF
                  Holden got hit.

        There is a pause.  That was bad news.

                                DECKARD
                  Bad?

                                GAFF
                  Severed spine.  You'd better get
                  in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll see you in a minute.

        The ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot.

        INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10

        An enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike
        Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
        case and police ID pinned to his coat.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
                  The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
                  and joy.  Holden was administering
                  the Voight-Kampff test when one
                  nailed him.

        The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
        through.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The Nexus-6 must be fast because
                  Holden was as quick as they come.
                  The report said there were six of
                  them.  Three males and three female.
                  Led by a combat model called Roy
                  Batty.

        INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11

        The INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  They escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  An aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  No crew.

        Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  I been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
        just poured for him.

                                DECKARD
                  Six, huh?

                                BRYANT
                  Five.  Three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  Genetic Sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                DECKARD
                  What was he after?

                                BRYANT
                  There wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  But bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the Nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  Going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  Guess
                  he found himself one.

        A grim pause.

                                DECKARD
                  You got a machine on it yet?

                                BRYANT
                  We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do we start?

        Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                BRYANT
                  The Tyrell Corporation has a
                  demo model.  Check it out on the
                  Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
                  the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  If that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                DECKARD
                  What was the cover on the one that
                  got Holden?

                                BRYANT
                  Industrial refuse.

                                DECKARD
                  Garbage man?

        Bryant nods.

                                DECKARD
                  Did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll go take a look.

        Deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
        watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  If the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  This was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  But I didn't give him a chance.

        EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12

        An electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out-
        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,
        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
        downpour.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13

        A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14

        The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15

        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
        them with interest.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16

        Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17

        For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
        something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears
        into the crowd.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18

        Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
        window.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19

        Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
        match, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could
        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley
        behind him and he's not out of breath.

        EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20

        Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
        a narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.

        INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21

        A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and
        small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.

        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Choose from a variety of seventy
                  nine different personality types.
                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-
                  free companion given to you upon
                  your arrival absolutely free...

        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,
        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
        next.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  To use as personal body servant
                  to tireless field hand -- the
                  custom tailored humanoid robot,
                  designed especially for your
                  needs.

        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and
        the woman seated at the table by the window are.

        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind
        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,
        right out of "Father Knows Best."

        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
        goes on around him.

        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
        quiet voice.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious 'things'?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was already there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just a man.

                                BATTY
                  Police man.

        Leon looks sullen.

                                BATTY
                  Why don't you have a seat.

        There's one next to him.  Leon pulls it over and sits.

                                BATTY
                  Enjoy the view.

        From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit
        so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
        almost invisible.  The view they're "enjoying" is
        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-
        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,
        MEMBERS.

        INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22

        Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a Charles Dickens invention.

        He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                CHEW
                  Well, you're right.  This little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                CHEW
                  You're a regular perfectionist,
                  Sebastian.

        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        Mr. Chew.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  It's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                CHEW
                  Your customer, eh?

        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams
        shut behind them.

        INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23

        Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                CHEW
                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?

        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                CHEW
                  Is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                CHEW
                  How much is he paying you?

        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                CHEW
                  Well, when do you get paid?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Soon as I finish the job.

                                CHEW
                  When might that be?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Day after tomorrow.

                                CHEW
                  Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

        Sebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                CHEW
                  The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
                  A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  Pay the little guy last.  You should
                  charge twice as much.  It'll make
                  him feel better.

        Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thanks, Mr. Chew.

        Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.

        EXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24

        Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
        came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as
        he heads for his truck.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25

        It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        The lettering on the side reads "J.R. SEBASTIAN -
        ANIMOID EXPRESS."  Sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!  You forgot your...

        He holds up the bag.  Hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How come you were in my truck?

                                PRIS
                  I was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You can get back in if you want...

        She can't make up her mind.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        She gets in.  Both of them are silent.  People are not
        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!  Where do you want to go?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You want to go home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona"
        poster?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Where are your folks?

                                PRIS
                  They left.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        Her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, where should I take you?

        She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  He turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.

        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    26

        Speeding along the freeway.  The terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  Deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  The screen flashes back.

        REQUEST

        Deckard punches up.  Letters flash across the screen:

        ESPER

        Screen flashes back:

        CLEARANCE

        Deckard punches up.

        BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

        Pause.

        Screen flashes:

        STAND BY.

        Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  Somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  If that's true, whoever made
                  Esper should have been shot.

                                ESPER
                  This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
                  ahead please.

        Esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                DECKARD
                  You equipped for random questions?

                                ESPER
                  Why, yes, of course.

                                DECKARD
                  You start.

                                ESPER
                  The five in question are third
                  generation Nexus Sixes, constructed

                  program.  Are you with me?

                                DECKARD
                  How do I stop one?

                                ESPER
                  Unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  Sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, but...

                                ESPER
                  I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  A direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
        immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE.

                                VOICE
                  You are in violation of traffic

        In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard
        presses his I.D. to the window.

        The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's
        car does too.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27

        A district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn
        with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        Sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28

        Well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands.
        
        Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        Pris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                PRIS
                  Whatcha doin'?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You scared me.

        But he's happy to see her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'm working.

        She's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look... better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        Trying to make light of it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        She sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you?

        He can't meet her eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

        It's not an easy subject.  His voice is barely audible.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still here?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

        There is a silence.  He steals a glance at her.

                                PRIS
                  I like you just the way you are.

        Under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                PRIS
                  As a matter of fact I did.  They've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Good.

        The implications catch up.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I can sleep on the couch.

        A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                MOUSE
                  Don't let the bed bugs bite!

        Taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        29

        It's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  A tired
        Deckard sits in front of it.  Esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

        A long pause.

                                ESPER
                  Here's something you might find
                  interesting.  They have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  However, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                DECKARD
                  I know all that.

                                ESPER
                  What about a summary then.

                                DECKARD
                  I think we're through for the night.

        Deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                ESPER
                  Mr. Deckard.

        Hesitates.

                                DECKARD
                  Yes?

                                ESPER
                  Do you have something against
                  science?

                                DECKARD
                  Not if it works.

                                ESPER
                  And what in your estimation works?

                                DECKARD
                  The umbrella.

        Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.

        INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30

        A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  But emigrants needed
                  incentive.  Over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  It was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
                  line.

        EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31

        The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open
        and Deckard steps out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  His claim to fame was making a
                  product more human than human and
                  sometimes the 'more' turned out to
                  be a problem.  This wasn't just an
                  escaped andy who broke his owner's
                  arm -- there were twenty-eight
                  people dead and the pressure was
                  on.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32

        Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  Not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  Some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-American for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button
        and Deckard walks away.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But what's more American than good
                  old supply and demand?  The
                  Government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  The big religious boys
                  said that Androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only God
                  could make people. I'm not religious,
                  but I was inclined to agree.
                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

        The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
                  Rachael.

        Deckard tips his head to her and steps in.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33

        No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes
        closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi-
        ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty
        is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A

        The door slides open and they continue down the corri-

                  It seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the

                                 DECKARD
                  A humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 RACHAEL
                  But because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
                  Deckard?

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B

        They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor.
        Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                RACHAEL
                  You like our owl?

        Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                DECKARD
                  It's artificial?

                                RACHAEL
                  Of course not.

        Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No
        room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're in a very unique position,
                  Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        Deckard has nothing to say.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you apprehensive?

                                DECKARD
                  Why should I be?

                                RACHAEL
                  For the responsibility of your
                  power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You got it wrong, girl.  I work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        He lets it sink in.

                                DECKARD
                  My job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  The more the
                  better.

        He walks out of the elevator first.

        INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34

        The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
        BREWING in the background.

        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of
        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
                  sit down.  Would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

                                TYRELL
                  Black?

                                DECKARD
                  Please.

        Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                TYRELL
                  Somehow, I didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

        He hands Deckard a cup of coffee.

                                TYRELL
                  Is this to be an empathy test?

                                DECKARD
                  Yes.

                                TYRELL
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  Plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        Deckard nods.

                                TYRELL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                TYRELL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                TYRELL
                  But in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                DECKARD
                  Nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                TYRELL
                  Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  The
                  Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                DECKARD
                  One that relies on human
                  interpretation.  Where's the
                  subject?

                                TYRELL
                  Sitting next to you.

        Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted,
        Tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Ready.

                                RACHAEL
                  Go ahead.

        In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                DECKARD
                  You're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching T.V. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the picture to your husband.
                  He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  You become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd never get an abortion.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  In your opinion.

                                RACHAEL
                  It would be my child.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        He notes the needles.  One goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                DECKARD
                  Lights please.

        The lights come on.

                                TYRELL
                  Well?

                                DECKARD
                  If she is, the machine works.

                                TYRELL
                  The machine works.  She is.

        Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to
        Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions did it take?

                                DECKARD
                  Thirteen.

        Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell.
        His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                DECKARD
                  She didn't know?

                                TYRELL
                  Memory implant.  She was programmed.
                  But I think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  I think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions does it usually
                  take, Mr. Deckard?

                                DECKARD
                  Five, maybe six.

        Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
        and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                TYRELL
                  You're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        Deckard glances back at him.

                                TYRELL
                  It's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look,
        but not Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  For the good of all, I recommend
                  you take Rachael with you.
                  Considering her uniqueness, I'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's
        style.  He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-
        Kampff.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

        Deckard is ready to go.

                                TYRELL
                  And how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                DECKARD
                  Discreetly.

                                TYRELL
                  All pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an Esper 231 -- I
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        Deckard opens the door.

                                TYRELL
                  Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
        turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     36

        As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage Dusenberg.  The headlights cut through the
        dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road.  A
        downgrade.

        A sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead."
        Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left.

        The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
        will remain, but the location suddenly changes to:

        INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                       37

        A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm.  The
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug.
        Her back to the viewer.  As she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
        VOICE intercedes.

                                VOICE
                  Let's keep our eyes on the road,
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Sorry.

        Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO:

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     38

        The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  The road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  Rags of mist skim by as the
        Dusenberg picks up speed.  It is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        39

        Swift, soft clouds overhead.  In the cold shine of
        the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow,
        melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth.

                                VOICE
                  Come on, stay with the machine.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     40

        The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.

        EXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41

        Cold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        This is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky
        bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                VOICE
                  We're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  How do you know I'm not?

                                VOICE
                  You're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  I can see right here,
                  I'm not getting a reading.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  I'm tired of this.

                                VOICE
                  Almost through.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42

        In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding.

        The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to
        pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES
        SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence.

        INT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43

        The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                DECKARD
                  So how did I do?

        Dr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                WHEELER
                  Nerves of steel.

                                DECKARD
                  No rust?

                                WHEELER
                  I didn't say that.  Your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                DECKARD
                  Meaning?

                                WHEELER
                  Meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        Deckard starts to dress.

                                WHEELER
                  During the road test...

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah?

                                WHEELER
                  Your mind kept wandering.  That
                  bothered me.

                                DECKARD
                  Huh huh.

                                WHEELER
                  Considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                DECKARD
                  True.

        Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                WHEELER
                  You got a birthday coming up.

        Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                WHEELER
                  But you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.

                                WHEELER
                  You're going to be over the limit.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, I could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but I still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                WHEELER
                  What if you change your mind?

                                DECKARD
                  They'll change the limit before
                  I change my mind.

                                WHEELER
                  You sure?

                                DECKARD
                  Never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        Deckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                DECKARD
                  Why didn't you go?

                                WHEELER
                  Too old.

                                DECKARD
                  But if you could?

        Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                WHEELER
                  My job is here.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        They shake hands and Deckard walks.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44

        The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but
        Pris isn't watching.

        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
        form above STOPS HER

        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        Sebastian.

        On the other side of the room, in his own world,
        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-     45
        NOON

        Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay.

        INT. FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-  46
        NOON

        The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well.
        Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence.

        INT. THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       47
        AFTERNOON

        She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart-
        ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door.

        INT. APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48
        AFTERNOON

        Mary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in
        a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room.
        It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and
        Pris nods back.

        Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                BATTY
                  What's going on down there?

                                PRIS
                  He's not ready yet.

                                BATTY
                  When?

                                PRIS
                  Tomorrow, he says.

        Batty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  Like an animal.

        EXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49

        The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk.
        Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-
        ramp curve.

        EXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50

        Moving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long, steep hill.

        EXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51

        At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise.

        INT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52

        He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's
        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of
        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,
        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53

        He slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got
        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                RACHAEL
                  Was that your dinner?

        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.  I called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  These
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but I thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's the Nexus information you
                  wanted.

        He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        He doesn't even want to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence.
        At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                DECKARD
                  Is there anything else?

                                RACHAEL
                  I know you think it complicates
                  your work, but I'm here to help.

                                DECKARD
                  I've already got more help than
                  I need.

                                RACHAEL
                  I think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        He doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                RACHAEL
                  There's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  Either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                RACHAEL
                  Two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        She smiles.

                                RACHAEL
                  No you don't.

        She lets it sink in.

                                RACHAEL
                  You use your equipment, don't you?

                                DECKARD
                  So?

                                RACHAEL
                  So, I'm a piece of equipment.
                  Use me.

        It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                DECKARD
                  That's okay, I'll get it...

        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do I make you nervous?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.

        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the
        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        She says it plain and simple.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                DECKARD
                  I can imagine.

                                RACHAEL
                  Can you?  I couldn't.

        These are not some of Deckard's finer moments.  But she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                RACHAEL
                  A part of me is glad.  I think I
                  feel more.  I don't like who I was
                  before.

        Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                DECKARD
                  So why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        He's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                RACHAEL
                  They probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                DECKARD
                  Right.

        He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        She's writing something on a card.

                                RACHAEL
                  I guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's my number.  If you need me.

        She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                RACHAEL
                  You better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                RACHAEL
                  Good night.

        And she's gone.

                                DECKARD
                  Night.

        He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a
        snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man
        and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old Rachael.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54

        He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The possibilities were infinite.
                  They could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  Like she said, it was short.
                  Longevity is what they were after.
                  The garbage man even wanted a past.
                  Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
                  I knew she was right.  The market
                  worked on turn-over.  Built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  That meant her too.  It
                  was something I didn't want to
                  think about.

        On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  Bryant here.  Regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, Esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  Tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  You better get on it.

                                DECKARD
                  I was just about to have my dinner.

                                BRYANT
                  If you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  I got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  Good luck.

        Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't
        want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.

        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55

        The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.

        INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56

        Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen-
        ing to Esper.

                  What is a conventional term?

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind.  Do they have that
                  knowledge?

                                ESPER

        Back to business.

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, gimme a run-down on the

        EXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57

        Deckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "FULL."  Deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck.

        Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58

        Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly
        enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an
        alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface
        -- parking it by a sign that says "NO PARKING."

        EXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59

        Not many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish
        small-time clubs.

        Deckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The
        pulsing neon over the entry says "TAFFEY'S BAR."

        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60

        Crowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar
        sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's
        looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the
        background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part
        of her juggling routine.

        Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a
        door at the rear.

        INT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61

        Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken
        Hawk" collector of young girls.

        It must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little
        room.

        Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  But at the moment he's not present.

        There's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET
        FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through
        the peeper.

        Deckard is out there holding up his I.D.

                                DECKARD
                  Taffey Lewis?

                                TAFFEY
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  Can I come in?

        There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard
        enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                TAFFEY
                  Excuse my niece there... She's
                  studying for an exam.

        Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                TAFFEY
                  Of course.

        Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                TAFFEY
                  You see I lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... What am I supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                DECKARD
                  Do you recognize any of
                  them?

        He stops at Zhora.

                                TAFFEY
                  This one looks familiar, but
                  I don't know.  Naw.  There's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                DECKARD
                  What did she want?

                                TAFFEY
                  Who?

                                DECKARD
                  The girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nothing.  She wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                DECKARD
                  What night?

                                TAFFEY
                  I didn't know if I wanted to
                  handle her -- I already got
                  a snake act.  But my partner
                  goes down there to the Opera
                  House on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                DECKARD
                  What's suck night?

                                TAFFEY
                  That's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  Bit I don't think that's
                  her.

                                DECKARD
                  You talking about the Opera
                  House on the Main?

        Taffey nods.  Deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                DECKARD
                  Book the good ones for where?

                                TAFFEY
                  Lots of places.  The tours,
                  the clubs, the Silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                DECKARD
                  What shows?

                                TAFFEY
                  Silicone Valley.  Lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  We book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  Those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        It's starting to get a little gooey.  Deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.

        INT. THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                        62

        Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  From the P.A. system the Announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Let's hear it for the Hermano
                  Brothers.

        Scattered APPLAUSE.  Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  She
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

        The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "In a Persian Market" as SALOME dances onstage.
        She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  She kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  Carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  Grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  Sounds of approval from the audience.
        The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.

        INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                  63

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  She's about
        to enter when:

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss Salome.

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the American Federation
                  of Variety Artists...

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the
                  Confidential Committee on Moral
                  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this position.  Did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.
                  You'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  I'd like to check
                  the dressing room if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.

        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64

        Musty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                DECKARD
                  It that mother real?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could
                  afford a real snake?

                                DECKARD
                  It's a good job.

                                SALOME
                  You mean the snake.

        Deckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                SALOME
                  The best.

                                DECKARD
                  Does it eat?

                                SALOME
                  Come on.

        His hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  He jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                SALOME
                  Jeezus!

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                SALOME
                  Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  They have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        His eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  I bet I would.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down
        low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

        Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you?

        He looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is
        short and blonde.

        Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        He stares at her a moment too long.

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmmmm?

        Deckard grins and she returns it.

        She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                ZHORA
                  You ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles
        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.
        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.

        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65

        Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall.  He sprints after
        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-
        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
        metal steps.

        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66

        It's raining heavily.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
        she's already around the corner.

        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.

        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door.

        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
        she dies.

        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.

        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
        running fast, but the car is faster.

        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
        rolls out FIRING.

        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...

        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
        through.

        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
        laser.  But she doesn't.

        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
        takes what's left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.

        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.

        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
        of metal and flesh.

        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-
        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from
        behind.

                                COP
                  Drop it!

        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and
        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two
        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a
        frisk.

        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the
        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.

        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the SERGEANT covering the action.

                                SERGEANT
                  On your belly!

        Deckard's not in the mood for it.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, Sergeant...

        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head.

        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.
        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop
        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a
        moment, then looks up.

                                COP
                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

        An embarrassing situation.

                                SERGEANT
                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.

        The Cops start pushing.  And for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like Leon.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT               67

        Your standard low class crapper.  Bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  This is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                BRYANT
                  Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  A little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, Deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  Now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        It's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                BRYANT
                  Well?

        Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        Bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                DECKARD
                  She was gonna get away.

                                BRYANT
                  Then let her get away.  I thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                BRYANT
                  I'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        Deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't like her.

                                BRYANT
                  You didn't like her!?

        He slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                BRYANT
                  You start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing
        to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and
        Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                BRYANT
                  Look, go home.  Get some rest.
                  Take an aspirin.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

        Bryant shuffles out like an old bear.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68

        Cheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place
        this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the
        bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes.

        In the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                BARTENDER
                  I can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                DECKARD
                  No problem.  Gimme another.

        The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        Russian accent.

                                RUSSIAN
                  Forgive me.  I thought was free
                  drink.  I will pay.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget it.

        But the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.
        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  But it's Leon.

                                LEON
                  I think I have no money.

                                DECKARD
                  It's okay.  Forget it.

                                LEON
                  But I would like to buy you drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll but you one.  What'll you
                  have?

                                LEON
                  Vodka!

                                DECKARD
                  Shot of vodka, please.

                                LEON
                  Thank you very much.

                                DECKARD
                  My pleasure.

        Deckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes
        it and they light up.  The drinks come.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that
        Deckard has to look.

                                LEON
                  You want to see my friends?

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry, don't have the time.

                                LEON
                  No problem.

        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                DECKARD
                  Those cockroaches?

                                LEON
                  Ya.

        Deckard looks interested.  One of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you had these guys?

                                LEON
                  Two months.  But this one is not
                  guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

        Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                LEON
                  Usually Blackie waits until Igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of Anna.

        Deckard nods, definitely interested.  He signals the
        bartender for another round.  The drinks arrive.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                LEON
                  You never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        Leon smiles slyly.

                                LEON
                  We will try.

        Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  They both lean down and watch intently.
        The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                LEON
                  It must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  He holds up the last and kisses it.

                                LEON
                  You like to kiss her goodbye.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

                                BARTENDER
                  Make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        What neither of them notices is that between Leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                LEON
                  I like you.

                                DECKARD
                  I like you too.

                                LEON
                  One more, eh?

                                DECKARD
                  I gotta piss.

        Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'll piss outside.

        Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.

        EXT. ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69

        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The
        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the
        quiet.

        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you know where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  The future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there
        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.

        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                DECKARD
                  Like I said, I don't need your
                  help.

        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                RACHAEL
                  You look terrible, you know that?

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70

        He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  They shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  They found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  On the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        He takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!  I thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  What do you need?

        He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink.
        Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  It's not polite.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do you want me to do?

                                DECKARD
                  Sit.

        She sits on the edge of the tub.

                                DECKARD
                  Gimme your arm.

        She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del-
        icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                RACHAEL
                  There's a lot I haven't done with
                  a man before.

        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're getting me wet.

        Oh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71

        The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His
        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72

        Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's
        been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
        fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches
        to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73

        Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number I'll return your call as
                  soon as I can.

        That's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck you, then.

        INT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74

        The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the
        door.

        You might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  There's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and
        Sebastian pokes his head in.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

        Nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Now, now, Waddles.

        Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles
        veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hello, Wrigley.

        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75

        Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to
        his apartment, opens the door, walks in.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76

        He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy
        Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                BATTY
                  Whoops.

        Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                PRIS
                  This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

                                BATTY
                  Hello, glad to meet you.

        He pumps Sebastian's free hand.

                                PRIS
                  And my Aunt Mary.

        Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm.

                                PRIS
                  And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
                  everybody.

        Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
                  If you hadn't come along...

                                MARY
                  We were worried to death.  It's
                  awfully kind of you.

        Sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                BATTY
                  We're not used to the big city.
                  Where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                MARY
                  You certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  Well stocked.

        Batty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you."

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put.  An
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  You live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, no, not really.  There's
                  Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        Everybody nods.  A long pause.

                                MARY
                  We haven't found it easy, Mr.
                  Sebastian.

        They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How about breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                BATTY
                  If it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

                                BATTY
                  Well, actually

                                MARY
                  We're famished.

        Sebastian is truly happy.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Okay, then.  You make yourselves
                  comfortable and I'll bring the
                  food right out.

        He disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                BATTY
                  Charming.

        Pris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on.

        There's a punitive edge to Batty's response.

                                BATTY
                  There's only three of us left.

        Pris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  How are things
                  at home?

        A little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                PIG
                  Home again, jiggidy jig.

        They all turn and stare at the pig.  Batty is delighted.

                                PRIS
                  I don't trust him.  I don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        The BELL-TONE from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                BATTY
                  He knows what he's doing.

                                MARY
                  If he won't cooperate?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  We'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

        INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY                   77

        Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                DECKARD
                  How are you doing, old man?

        Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
                  not really great, but I feel just
                  great.  How you like my new suit?

                                DECKARD
                  Well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
                  pee.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
                  So how are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm doing okay.

                                HOLDEN
                  From what I hear you're doing
                  great.  Bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.
                         (pause)
                  But that's what I wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                HOLDEN
                  Money?

                                DECKARD
                  No.  I got a problem.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let's hear it.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'm starting to empathize
                  with these Nexus-sixes.

        Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both
        notice it.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm taking a piss.

        They wait for the light to abate.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let me ask you something, Deck.
                  You been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.

                                HOLDEN
                  That's what I thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  That's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                DECKARD
                  What about -- not sex -- but love?

        Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Love is just another name for sex.
                  Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  I don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                DECKARD
                  These aren't just...

                                HOLDEN
                  I know what they are, Deck --
                  Look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                HOLDEN
                  Believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  It's a contradiction.
                  You might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                HOLDEN
                  Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
                  sleepy.  It's been good talking
                  to you.

        Deckard stands.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        But he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78

        He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those
        locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks
        surprised to see him.  Him too.

                                RACHAEL
                  I told you I'd come back.

                                DECKARD
                  You did?

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't hear me.  You were
                  sleeping.

        He likes that.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you glad I'm here?

        He is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up.
        It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                RACHAEL
                  Who is this?

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Where is he?

                                DECKARD
                  Dead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Oh.

        She puts it down and comes to him.

                                RACHAEL
                  How come you're not on the job?

                                DECKARD
                  I am.  Part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                RACHAEL
                  How are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  Not too good.

        She sits next to him.

        Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do people do in the afternoon?

                                DECKARD
                  If they are smart, they take
                  naps.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79

        They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you dream?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  Sometimes.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wish I could.

        His hand moves over her shoulder.

                                DECKARD
                  Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        His hand goes under the sheet.

                                RACHAEL
                  I mean asleep.

        She feels good.  He moves closer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's another thing I can't
                  do.

        He kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                RACHAEL
                  Nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  I read that.

                                DECKARD
                  It wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know, I have nothing
                  to compare it to.  I guess I
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know... I think I missed
                  something.

                                DECKARD
                  Like?

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not sure.  Is there a
                  secret?

        Her face is close.  She's looking right at him.  Her
        lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.  If there is I'd
                  like to find it.

        Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        80

        Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  Although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just all so... so different.

        Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're androids.

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're all so perfect.

        Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus - 6.
        
        Sebastian whistles.  Mary's head is shaking slightly.
        Pris gets up and moves to the couch.  Batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                BATTY
                  We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
                  He's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  He's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Could you...

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something?

                                BATTY
                  Like what?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like...

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

        It's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming.

        Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You mean that you can't come here
                  and I can't go there?

                                BATTY
                  Not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics,
                  Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Sebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                BATTY
                  What about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell?

        Batty nods.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He's not really my friend.  I just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                BATTY
                  Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He could?

                                BATTY
                  His company made us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him
                  in person.  But he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

                                BATTY
                  When do you deliver your project?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  This afternoon.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's
        eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us?

        There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.

        Pris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief
        and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us,
                  Sebastian.  What do you think,
                  Mary?

                                MARY
                  I don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                BATTY
                  Pris?

        Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him.

        That has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                BATTY
                  You're our best and only friend.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81

        Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                RACHAEL
                  When was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmm?

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                DECKARD
                  Don't be fooled by appearances.

                                RACHAEL
                  It appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        He rolls over to admire her legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        He kisses the back of her thigh.

                                RACHAEL
                  They could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  There's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As
        she starts to plug it in --

                                DECKARD
                  Oh no, don't do that.

        He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                RACHAEL
                  But if I don't plug it in how can
                  I...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                RACHAEL
                  But then how can you...

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like the noise.  Just
                  practice.  Practice makes perfect.

        She stares at him like he's nuts.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
                  how you would do it.

        Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                DECKARD
                  How about under the couch there.
                  Come on.

        She bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back
        at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  This feels stupid.

                                DECKARD
                  Good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  Part of your education.

        She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're sick, Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  I never felt better.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82

        Mansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck
        parked among richer relations, including a spinner and
        a 1928 Dusenberg.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83

        The den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies,
        and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
        proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his
        lap.

        Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait.
        Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
        the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84

        Tyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
        her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And
        two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
        for their dad's attention.

        From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
        fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
        house.

        EXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85

        And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a
        figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86

        On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
        one of the animals.

        He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87

        Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  As the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's
        bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The
        Beanstalk.

                                STYLES
                  Okay, I'll take that now.

        Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        Sebastian stops him.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Wait!

        He almost forgot.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Can't fly without the pilot.

        Sebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88

        Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat-
        ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy
        heads to watch something pass.

        In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
        beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89

        It's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is
        an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion,
        gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace.

        The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
        for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the
        oldest child.

        Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over
        the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is
        down before the boy.

        IAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up
        at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's"
        hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the
        griffon steps out of the shell.

                                IAN
                  Oh!

        Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage,
        the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing
        its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air.

        The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn-
        ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a
        dive.

        Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan.

        Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian.

                                IAN
                  Papa!  Did you make this?

                                TYRELL
                  No.  We can make man, but not a
                  griffon.

        He bends down and kisses his wife.

                                TYRELL
                  Have to give the cottage industry
                  a chance too.

        Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90

        Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
        the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                TYRELL
                  A friend of yours, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Oh?

        Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.  Tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                BATTY
                  A little talk it all I need.

        Tyrell looks at Sebastian.  Considers consequences.
        Back to Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        Batty thinks it over.

                                BATTY
                  Yeah.  It might be better if we
                  talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
                  don't you go home.

                                TYRELL
                  Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
                  you.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
                  you later.

        He slips out closing the door behind him.  Opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Was everything okay?

                                TYRELL
                  Just beautiful.

        He's gone.

        If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can he do for you?

                                BATTY
                  Can the maker repair what he makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

                                TYRELL
                  Come here.

        Batty walks forward.

                                TYRELL
                  Sit down.

        Batty does.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
                  ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Batty nods grimly.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last.

                                TYRELL
                  Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
                  A high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        Batty smiles bitterly.

                                TYRELL
                  Also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                BATTY
                  I am?

        Tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The bast of all possible androids.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done some questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things.

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        They share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand.
        Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat-
        ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty
        stifles it.

        Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's
        head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small.

        Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.

        INT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A

        Styles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming
        towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not
        one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  Could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is?

        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has
        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,
        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits
        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty
        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.

        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91

        The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're
        waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty
        observing from the doorway.

        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                MRS. TYRELL
                  May I help you?

        Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.

        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92

        In the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with
        blood.  Batty is washing his hands.

        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.
        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of
        her.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93

        Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  Never even seen books on the
                  subject.  She went through
                  everything I had, and we talked.
                  And there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, I couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  But
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  She was
                  more alive than anyone I'd ever
                  known.

        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                RACHAEL
                  You and I are good friends, huh?

        He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's so easy.

        Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She
        laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                DECKARD
                  You mean a woman?

                                RACHAEL
                  Uh-huh.

                                DECKARD
                  What's a long time?

                                RACHAEL
                  Ten years.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  She's not with you?

                                DECKARD
                  Who.

        A pause.

                                BRYANT
                  Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
                  South.

                                DECKARD
                  Got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  The cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  Pressure is
                  definitely on.  The Nexus program
                  is terminated.  When you finish
                  there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
                  and retire.

        Deckard says nothing.

                                BRYANT
                  If you don't, we will.  It has to
                  be total, Deckard.  That's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  Got it?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  I got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Go.

        He hangs up the receiver and gets up.  She watches him
        from the bed.  The gun goes into his belt.  He loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  She watches every move.

                                RACHAEL
                  Why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                DECKARD
                  Because it's not.

                                RACHAEL
                  Don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                DECKARD
                  Andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you think I simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                DECKARD
                  No, I don't.

        Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  He turns and they're facing one another.
        Neither of them moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't leave here.  Don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                RACHAEL
                  What difference will it make?

                                DECKARD
                  Just wait here.

        He goes to the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what I think?

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  That some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        He has to laugh.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what else I think?

                                DECAKRD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  This was the best day of my life.

        He turns and goes through the door.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      94

        Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                MARY
                  Let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                BATTY
                  Where?

                                MARY
                  Anywhere.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  What's the point?

                                MARY
                  Not to be trapped.

                                BATTY
                  You underestimate the trap, Mary.

        Sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Just thought I'd...

                                BATTY
                  No, you stay here with us.  Out
                  last night together.

        They all watch.

        Sebastian walks away from the door.

                                BATTY
                  Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
                  Shine before you're turned off.

        She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns.

        Sebastian is by the window.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Someone is coming here.

        Batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                BATTY
                  One man.
                         (he smiles)
                  He must be good.

                                MARY
                  Then go get him.

                                BATTY
                  That wouldn't be very sporting.

        Sebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                PRIS
                  I want to do it.

                                BATTY
                  Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
                  little for everybody.  A
                  masterpiece.

        A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Turn out the lights, Pris.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95

        In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks
        around.  Nobody there, just silence.

        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.

        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96

        Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-
        well.

        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-
        ing an eye on the stairwell door.

        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator
        door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between
        the doors, jamming the operation.

        Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
        well door, then pushes it open and:

        INT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97

        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-
        to the figure hovering to his left.

        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
        gets to his feet.

        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
        STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.

        INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98

        At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF
        MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.
        The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.
        Each door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard
        steps to the side and peers through.

        INT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99

        It's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.

        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
        swaying.

        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
        ing.  Deckard's in his element.

        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.

        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck.

        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head.

                                PRIS
                  Naughty, naughty.

        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot
        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.

        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine.

        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
        bad place for flesh and bone.

        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
        it's welded in hers.

        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver.

        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.

        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
        it was ice, weight stand in tow.

        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face.

        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap.

        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
        for the kill, she freezes.

        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.

        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.

        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward.

        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to Deckard.  Dead.

        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100

        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101

        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong.

        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A

        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes
        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.
        None.  He continues up the stairs.

        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102

        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.
        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.
        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.

        He kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
        response from either door.

        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.

        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.

        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
        off her.

        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.

        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.

        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet
        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the
        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:

                                DECKARD
                  Hello, Roy.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103

        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.
        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is
        empty.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104

        Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door.

        INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105

        Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's
        nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to-
        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds
        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the
        hallway.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106

        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes, he's nude.

                                BATTY
                  You wanna play?

        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.
        Pops out again.

                                BATTY
                  Not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent.  I thought you
                  were supposed to be good.  Aren't
                  you the man?!

        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-
        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his
        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
        len, trembling from the thrill of it.

                                BATTY
                  This is how we do it up there, lad!
                  Come on!

        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the
        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.

        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-
        hind him.

        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.
        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.
        Batty kneels next to him.

                                BATTY
                  Not hurt, are you?  You better get
                  it up or I'm going to have to kill
                  you.  Unless you're alive you can't
                  play.  And if you don't play, you
                  don't get to be alive.

        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales
        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push.

                                BATTY
                  That's the spirit.

        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's
        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the
        doors.

        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and
        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,
        towards the jeering voice.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you
                  got!  I'm right here on the other
                  side of the door.  But you gotta
                  shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

        Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and
        FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty.

        INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107

        The full length mirror on the other side of the room
        SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                BATTY
                  Straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        They're face to face.

                                BATTY
                  You don't have a chance, do you?

        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                BATTY
                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  Give you a
                  handicap.  I won't run through any
                  more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
                  use the doors.  Okay?

        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-
        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Come on, let's use that brain!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108

        He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                BATTY
                  Think!  We need a little
                  resilience around here!

        He yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                BATTY
                  Where are those balls of yours?!
                  Let's see a little bravery!

        The storm passes.

        Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                BATTY
                  That was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
                  happen again.

        He drops him.

                                BATTY
                  I'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No
        sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby.
        He doesn't bother.

        Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He
        had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.

        On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                BATTY
                  Where you going?

        He wait a moment for Deckard's answer.

                                BATTY
                  No cheating.  A promise is a
                  promise.  I'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  You go get your
                  laser gun now.  And I'll give you
                  a few seconds before I come.

        Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles.

        Deckard's running down the corridor.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  One!

        Halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Two!

        Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment
        above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard
        considers it.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  No fair jumping through holes.  You
                  might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

        Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109

        His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage.
        He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is
        dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails
        protruding.  Too small.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110

        Batty's coming up the steps.

                                BATTY
                  Five!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111

        Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers
        the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112

        Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors.

                                BATTY
                  Six!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113

        Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at
        his hand.  It's trembling.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Seven!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114

        Batty's standing in front of a door, listening.

                                BATTY
                  Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
                  here, I don't think.  Eight!

        He goes to the next door.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
                  it.  Nine!

        Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115

        Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard
        CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Ten!

        The door explodes!

        A shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back.
        but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be-
        fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's
        right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on
        Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                BATTY
                  One point for you.

        The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far
        wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder.

                                BATTY
                  Ho ho!  Try it again!

        He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his
        laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up
        against him.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
                  I'm what we've made!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116

        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and
        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.
        Something is starting to crack.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                BATTY
                  It's time to die.

        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye
        moves over the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!

        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.

        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard
        catches it.

                                BATTY
                  That's for you.

        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.

                                BATTY
                  Stick it in your ear and push.
                  If that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                BATTY
                  Believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what I'm about
                  to do.

        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.

                                BATTY
                  Well?

        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117

        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream
        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                BATTY
                  Crap.

        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  He spins...

        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
        again.
        
        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
        ankle.

        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118

        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.
        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119

        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's
        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
        railing.

        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
        
        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
        fingers are starting to slip.

        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.

        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
        hand grip.

        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.

        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
        of.

        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120

        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into
        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard
        is glad to see it.

        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-
        lapses on the front seat.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121

        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The
        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
        that comes from the bed.

        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.

        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122

        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He
        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.
                  Out of the city.  Like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  Where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  We had a good time.  She told me a
                  funny story and I taught her a
                  song.  A song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.

        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123

        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.
        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124

        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.

        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125

        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like
        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence
        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.

        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126

        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I told myself over and over again,
                  if I hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  I didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, I didn't want the job.

                  She said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  And she chose.  And a part of me
                  was almost glad.  Not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long
                  time I wanted to kill him.  But
                  what was the point?  There were too
                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
                  Maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  The secret never
                  found.  But I got as close with
                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
                  stay with me a long time.  I guess
                  we made each other real.

        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.

                                ****************

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION LOCKER ROOM - DAY               1

        THE EYE                                                 2

        It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "LEON" it says on
        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I
                  take tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  Already had I.Q. test this year --
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                         (cutting in)
                  Reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  Answer
                  quickly as you can.

        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                LEON
                  What one?

        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  What desert?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  So you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling
                  towards you...

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're
                  not helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!
                  Why is that, Leon?

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        FIRES at the machine on the table.

        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.

        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3

        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe
        the end, of the beginning of a day.

        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400
        miles an hour.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4

        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,
        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
        the passenger half way down.

        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.

        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5

        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the
        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.

        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6

        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and
        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
        closer and peers through the glass.

        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN
        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.

        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7

        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-
        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard
        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the
        sweltering night.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8

        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his
        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow
        passage under orbs of yellow light.

        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9

        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows
        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  It was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours
                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit
                  with an Eskimo lady in North East
                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to
                  make.  It was so good, I didn't
                  want to leave, so I left a day
                  early.

        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                DECKARD
                  Contact.  This is Blade Runner One
                  calling Com-fast 27.

        The SOUND OF A CHIME precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                VOICE
                  Blade Runner One, stand by please.

        A pause.  Followed by a husky male voice.

                                VOICE
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Yah, Gaff.

                                GAFF (VOICE)
                  Where the hell you been?

                                DECKARD
                  You know where I been.  I been on
                  vacation.

                                GAFF
                  Next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                DECKARD
                  What's up?

                                GAFF
                  Holden got hit.

        There is a pause.  That was bad news.

                                DECKARD
                  Bad?

                                GAFF
                  Severed spine.  You'd better get
                  in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll see you in a minute.

        The ENGINE REVS, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and Deckard jams out of the lot.

        INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE - NIGHT                        10

        An enormous grey vault of a building.  A businesslike
        Deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief-
        case and police ID pinned to his coat.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6,
                  The Tyrell Corporation's new pride
                  and joy.  Holden was administering
                  the Voight-Kampff test when one
                  nailed him.

        The door in front of Deckard slides open and he walks
        through.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The Nexus-6 must be fast because
                  Holden was as quick as they come.
                  The report said there were six of
                  them.  Three males and three female.
                  Led by a combat model called Roy
                  Batty.

        INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT                  11

        The INSPECTOR is in his fifties.  The deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  They escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  Killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  An aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  No crew.

        Bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Bryant's got a liver problem.  A
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  I been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        Deckard sets down the report and takes the shot Bryant
        just poured for him.

                                DECKARD
                  Six, huh?

                                BRYANT
                  Five.  Three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  Genetic Sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                DECKARD
                  What was he after?

                                BRYANT
                  There wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  But bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the Nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  Going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  Guess
                  he found himself one.

        A grim pause.

                                DECKARD
                  You got a machine on it yet?

                                BRYANT
                  We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do we start?

        Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                BRYANT
                  The Tyrell Corporation has a
                  demo model.  Check it out on the
                  Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
                  the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  If that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                DECKARD
                  What was the cover on the one that
                  got Holden?

                                BRYANT
                  Industrial refuse.

                                DECKARD
                  Garbage man?

        Bryant nods.

                                DECKARD
                  Did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        Bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll go take a look.

        Deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
        watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  If the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  This was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  But I didn't give him a chance.

        EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                      12

        An electrical storm is brewing.  Deckard stands out-
        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,
        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden
        downpour.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                         13

        A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.

        INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                      14

        The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15

        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
        them with interest.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               16

        Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.

        EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT                               17

        For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash
        something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears
        into the crowd.

        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                18

        Deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the
        window.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      19

        Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to
        match, but he's a graceful runner.  Looks like he could
        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley
        behind him and he's not out of breath.

        EXT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT                                  20

        Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto
        a narrow street.  The Asian Quarter.

        INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT                            21

        A seamy as well as steamy little place.  Counter and
        small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.

        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Choose from a variety of seventy
                  nine different personality types.
                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-
                  free companion given to you upon
                  your arrival absolutely free...

        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray
        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,
        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the
        next.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  To use as personal body servant
                  to tireless field hand -- the
                  custom tailored humanoid robot,
                  designed especially for your
                  needs.

        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and
        the woman seated at the table by the window are.

        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind
        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,
        right out of "Father Knows Best."

        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
        goes on around him.

        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
        quiet voice.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious 'things'?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was already there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just a man.

                                BATTY
                  Police man.

        Leon looks sullen.

                                BATTY
                  Why don't you have a seat.

        There's one next to him.  Leon pulls it over and sits.

                                BATTY
                  Enjoy the view.

        From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit
        so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem
        almost invisible.  The view they're "enjoying" is
        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-
        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,
        MEMBERS.

        INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT                       22

        Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a Charles Dickens invention.

        He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  After
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                CHEW
                  Well, you're right.  This little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                CHEW
                  You're a regular perfectionist,
                  Sebastian.

        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        Mr. Chew.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  It's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                CHEW
                  Your customer, eh?

        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams
        shut behind them.

        INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                          23

        Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                CHEW
                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?

        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                CHEW
                  Is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                CHEW
                  How much is he paying you?

        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                CHEW
                  Well, when do you get paid?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Soon as I finish the job.

                                CHEW
                  When might that be?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Day after tomorrow.

                                CHEW
                  Oh!  Day after tomorrow.

        Sebastian nods.  Chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                CHEW
                  The rich hate to pay, Sebastian.
                  A guy like Tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  Pay the little guy last.  You should
                  charge twice as much.  It'll make
                  him feel better.

        Sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  Chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thanks, Mr. Chew.

        Chew pulls the door open for him and Sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.

        EXT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S STORE - STREET - NIGHT             24

        Sebastian may lack co-ordination but he got what he
        came for and there's a hopeful spring to his walk as
        he heads for his truck.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S AMBULANCE - NIGHT                      25

        It's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        The lettering on the side reads "J.R. SEBASTIAN -
        ANIMOID EXPRESS."  Sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  It's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!  You forgot your...

        He holds up the bag.  Hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How come you were in my truck?

                                PRIS
                  I was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        She stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        Sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You can get back in if you want...

        She can't make up her mind.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        She gets in.  Both of them are silent.  People are not
        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!  Where do you want to go?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You want to go home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        What do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "Welcome to Sunny Arizona"
        poster?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Where are your folks?

                                PRIS
                  They left.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        She leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        Her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, where should I take you?

        She looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff.  If you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  He turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.

        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    26

        Speeding along the freeway.  The terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  Deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  The screen flashes back.

        REQUEST

        Deckard punches up.  Letters flash across the screen:

        ESPER

        Screen flashes back:

        CLEARANCE

        Deckard punches up.

        BLADE RUNNER ONE CODE ML-33

        Pause.

        Screen flashes:

        STAND BY.

        Deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  Somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  If that's true, whoever made
                  Esper should have been shot.

                                ESPER
                  This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go
                  ahead please.

        Esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                DECKARD
                  You equipped for random questions?

                                ESPER
                  Why, yes, of course.

                                DECKARD
                  You start.

                                ESPER
                  The five in question are third
                  generation Nexus Sixes, constructed
                  of skin-flesh culture, selected

                  program.  Are you with me?

                                DECKARD
                  How do I stop one?

                                ESPER
                  Unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  Sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, but...

                                ESPER
                  I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  A direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        The communication is interrupted by a BELL which is
        immediately followed by a stern, MECHANICAL VOICE.

                                VOICE

        In his rear view mirror Deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  They draw silently alongside.  Deckard
        presses his I.D. to the window.

        The cop tosses a salute to Deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  And Deckard's
        car does too.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT                              27

        A district of silence and ruin.  The street is strewn
        with refuse.  The building looks vacant.  A ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  The vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        Sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        MR. DEETCHUM, the old Watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      28

        Well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  And shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  Like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from Sebastian's wise hands.
        
        Sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  The tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        The object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  The needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        Suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        Pris is light on her feet.  She's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                PRIS
                  Whatcha doin'?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You scared me.

        But he's happy to see her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'm working.

        She's changed her dress and made up her face.  Looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look... better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        He watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        Trying to make light of it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        She sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you?

        He can't meet her eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

        It's not an easy subject.  His voice is barely audible.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still here?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.

        There is a silence.  He steals a glance at her.

                                PRIS
                  I like you just the way you are.

        Under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                PRIS
                  As a matter of fact I did.  They've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Good.

        The implications catch up.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I can sleep on the couch.

        A little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                MOUSE
                  Don't let the bed bugs bite!

        Taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        29

        It's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  A tired
        Deckard sits in front of it.  Esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

        A long pause.

                                ESPER
                  Here's something you might find
                  interesting.  They have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  However, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                DECKARD
                  I know all that.

                                ESPER
                  What about a summary then.

                                DECKARD
                  I think we're through for the night.

        Deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                ESPER
                  Mr. Deckard.

        Hesitates.

                                DECKARD
                  Yes?

                                ESPER
                  Do you have something against
                  science?

                                DECKARD
                  Not if it works.

                                ESPER
                  And what in your estimation works?

                                DECKARD
                  The umbrella.

        Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before Esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.

        INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30

        A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  Every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  But emigrants needed
                  incentive.  Over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  It was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the
                  line.

        EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31

        The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open
        and Deckard steps out.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  His claim to fame was making a
                  product more human than human and
                  sometimes the 'more' turned out to
                  be a problem.  This wasn't just an
                  escaped andy who broke his owner's
                  arm -- there were twenty-eight
                  people dead and the pressure was
                  on.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32

        Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  Not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  Some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-American for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button
        and Deckard walks away.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  But what's more American than good
                  old supply and demand?  The
                  Government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  The big religious boys
                  said that Androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only God
                  could make people. I'm not religious,
                  but I was inclined to agree.
                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.

        The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is
                  Rachael.

        Deckard tips his head to her and steps in.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33

        No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes
        closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi-
        ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty
        is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A

        The door slides open and they continue down the corri-
        dor.

                                 RACHAEL
                  It seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit.

                                 DECKARD
                  A humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 RACHAEL
                  But because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  Correct, Mr.
                  Deckard?

        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B

        They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor.
        Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                RACHAEL
                  You like our owl?

        Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                DECKARD
                  It's artificial?

                                RACHAEL
                  Of course not.

        Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No
        room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're in a very unique position,
                  Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        Deckard has nothing to say.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you apprehensive?

                                DECKARD
                  Why should I be?

                                RACHAEL
                  For the responsibility of your
                  power.  Being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        The door slides open.  Deckard looks down at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You got it wrong, girl.  I work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        He lets it sink in.

                                DECKARD
                  My job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  The more the
                  better.

        He walks out of the elevator first.

        INT. INNER SANCTUM OF DR. TYRELL - DAY                  34

        The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE
        BREWING in the background.

        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of
        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  How do you do, Mr. Deckard.  Please
                  sit down.  Would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

                                TYRELL
                  Black?

                                DECKARD
                  Please.

        Tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to Deckard.  The congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                TYRELL
                  Somehow, I didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  Here you are, Mr. Deckard.

        He hands Deckard a cup of coffee.

                                TYRELL
                  Is this to be an empathy test?

                                DECKARD
                  Yes.

                                TYRELL
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  Plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        Deckard nods.

                                TYRELL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                TYRELL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                TYRELL
                  But in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                DECKARD
                  Nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the Voight-Kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                TYRELL
                  Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  The
                  Voight-Kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                DECKARD
                  One that relies on human
                  interpretation.  Where's the
                  subject?

                                TYRELL
                  Sitting next to you.

        Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighted,
        Tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        THE VOIGHT-KAMPFF                                       35

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Ready.

                                RACHAEL
                  Go ahead.

        In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                DECKARD
                  You're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching T.V. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go to red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the picture to your husband.
                  He likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  You become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd never get an abortion.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  In your opinion.

                                RACHAEL
                  It would be my child.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        He notes the needles.  One goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                DECKARD
                  Lights please.

        The lights come on.

                                TYRELL
                  Well?

                                DECKARD
                  If she is, the machine works.

                                TYRELL
                  The machine works.  She is.

        Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to
        Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions did it take?

                                DECKARD
                  Thirteen.

        Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell.
        His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                DECKARD
                  She didn't know?

                                TYRELL
                  Memory implant.  She was programmed.
                  But I think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  I think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions does it usually
                  take, Mr. Deckard?

                                DECKARD
                  Five, maybe six.

        Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael
        and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                TYRELL
                  You're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        Deckard glances back at him.

                                TYRELL
                  It's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        Less of a man might shrink at the end of Deckard's look,
        but not Tyrell.

                                TYRELL
                  For the good of all, I recommend
                  you take Rachael with you.
                  Considering her uniqueness, I'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        Deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of Tyrell's
        style.  He turns away and starts packing up the Voight-
        Kampff.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

        Deckard is ready to go.

                                TYRELL
                  And how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                DECKARD
                  Discreetly.

                                TYRELL
                  All pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an Esper 231 -- I
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        Deckard opens the door.

                                TYRELL
                  Mr. Deckard, I think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard
        turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     36

        As seen through the windshield from the passenger side
        of a vintage Dusenberg.  The headlights cut through the
        dark, illuminating a narrow strip of mountain road.  A
        downgrade.

        A sign slides by stating:  "Caution Curves Ahead."
        Good advice considering the sheer nightmare of a drop
        to the right and the wall of solid rock to the left.

        The steady HUM of the ENGINE and the HISS of the TIRES
        will remain, but the location suddenly changes to:

        INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                       37

        A pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm.  The
        young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug.
        Her back to the viewer.  As she bends over to vacuum
        beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an
        admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired MALE
        VOICE intercedes.

                                VOICE
                  Let's keep our eyes on the road,
                  Deckard.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  Sorry.

        Abruptly the VIEW FLASHES BACK TO:

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     38

        The moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  The road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  Rags of mist skim by as the
        Dusenberg picks up speed.  It is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        39

        Swift, soft clouds overhead.  In the cold shine of
        the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples
        and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the
        frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue-white snow,
        melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich
        brown earth.

                                VOICE
                  Come on, stay with the machine.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     40

        The Dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  Rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  Not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        The Dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        Good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.

        EXT. LAKE - DAY                                         41

        Cold and gray.  The current running strong.  The nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        This is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  A sky
        bluer than the Madonna's cloak.  The kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                VOICE
                  We're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  How do you know I'm not?

                                VOICE
                  You're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  I can see right here,
                  I'm not getting a reading.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  I'm tired of this.

                                VOICE
                  Almost through.

        INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                     42

        In the Dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  And the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        Suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  Large ones, of a bus or a truck.  Blinding.

        The Dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  No room to
        pass.  HORNS BLAST.  The Dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  The hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  Brakes locked, TIRES
        SCREAMING, skidding.  The Dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  The last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  Silence.

        INT. DOCTOR WHEELER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                43

        The good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  Displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        Deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                DECKARD
                  So how did I do?

        Dr. Wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                WHEELER
                  Nerves of steel.

                                DECKARD
                  No rust?

                                WHEELER
                  I didn't say that.  Your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                DECKARD
                  Meaning?

                                WHEELER
                  Meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        Deckard starts to dress.

                                WHEELER
                  During the road test...

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah?

                                WHEELER
                  Your mind kept wandering.  That
                  bothered me.

                                DECKARD
                  Huh huh.

                                WHEELER
                  Considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                DECKARD
                  True.

        Wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating Deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                WHEELER
                  You got a birthday coming up.

        Deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  Wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                WHEELER
                  But you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.

                                WHEELER
                  You're going to be over the limit.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, I could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but I still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                WHEELER
                  What if you change your mind?

                                DECKARD
                  They'll change the limit before
                  I change my mind.

                                WHEELER
                  You sure?

                                DECKARD
                  Never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        Deckard is ready to go.  Looking at Wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                DECKARD
                  Why didn't you go?

                                WHEELER
                  Too old.

                                DECKARD
                  But if you could?

        Wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                WHEELER
                  My job is here.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        They shake hands and Deckard walks.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON             44

        The referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two Mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  If not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but
        Pris isn't watching.

        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE
        form above STOPS HER

        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        Sebastian.

        On the other side of the room, in his own world,
        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-     45
        NOON

        Pris moving smoothly past the doors, some of them open
        and warped offering sights and shadow and decay.

        INT. FIRE STAIRS - SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTER-  46
        NOON

        The gloom in here is like the light of the empty well.
        Her feet against the metal steps reverberate in the
        hollow silence.

        INT. THE FLOOR ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       47
        AFTERNOON

        She's running now, down the hall, stops at the apart-
        ment directly above Sebastian's and opens the door.

        INT. APARTMENT ABOVE SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATE       48
        AFTERNOON

        Mary turns her head as Pris comes in.  She's sitting in
        a chair.  The only piece of furniture in the room.
        It's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  She nods and
        Pris nods back.

        Batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                BATTY
                  What's going on down there?

                                PRIS
                  He's not ready yet.

                                BATTY
                  When?

                                PRIS
                  Tomorrow, he says.

        Batty nods he can't wait.  Pris glances at Mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  Pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  Batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  Like an animal.

        EXT. DECKARD'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT                    49

        The sky is streaked with remnants of a lingering dusk.
        Prisms of light flash over the sheen of Deckard's car
        as he cuts off the freeway and sweeps down the off-
        ramp curve.

        EXT./INT. CAR - STREETS - NIGHT                         50

        Moving through the dark city streets.  Deckard turns a
        corner and guns it up a long, steep hill.

        EXT. STREET - DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               51

        At the top of the hill the car pulls into a drive and
        disappears into the subterranean garage of a high-rise.

        INT. CORRIDOR DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT               52

        He's coming down the hall carrying a foil wrapped
        plastic plate and stops in front of his door.  It's
        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of
        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,
        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door
        shut behind him.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        53

        He slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got
        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                RACHAEL
                  Was that your dinner?

        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.  I called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  These
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but I thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        She's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  But it's taking Deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's the Nexus information you
                  wanted.

        He takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        He doesn't even want to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        He realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  The situation makes awkward silence.
        At least for him.  She's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                DECKARD
                  Is there anything else?

                                RACHAEL
                  I know you think it complicates
                  your work, but I'm here to help.

                                DECKARD
                  I've already got more help than
                  I need.

                                RACHAEL
                  I think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        He doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                RACHAEL
                  There's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  Either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                DECKARD
                  Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                RACHAEL
                  Two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                DECKARD
                  I work alone.

        She smiles.

                                RACHAEL
                  No you don't.

        She lets it sink in.

                                RACHAEL
                  You use your equipment, don't you?

                                DECKARD
                  So?

                                RACHAEL
                  So, I'm a piece of equipment.
                  Use me.

        It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                DECKARD
                  That's okay, I'll get it...

        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do I make you nervous?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.

        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the
        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        She says it plain and simple.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        Deckard nods.  He feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                DECKARD
                  I can imagine.

                                RACHAEL
                  Can you?  I couldn't.

        These are not some of Deckard's finer moments.  But she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                RACHAEL
                  A part of me is glad.  I think I
                  feel more.  I don't like who I was
                  before.

        Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                DECKARD
                  So why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        He's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                RACHAEL
                  They probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                DECKARD
                  Right.

        He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        She's writing something on a card.

                                RACHAEL
                  I guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's my number.  If you need me.

        She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                RACHAEL
                  You better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                RACHAEL
                  Good night.

        And she's gone.

                                DECKARD
                  Night.

        He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a
        snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man
        and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old Rachael.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54

        He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        The over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  The possibilities were infinite.
                  They could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  Like she said, it was short.
                  Longevity is what they were after.
                  The garbage man even wanted a past.
                  Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but
                  I knew she was right.  The market
                  worked on turn-over.  Built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  That meant her too.  It
                  was something I didn't want to
                  think about.

        On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  Bryant here.  Regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, Esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  Tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  You better get on it.

                                DECKARD
                  I was just about to have my dinner.

                                BRYANT
                  If you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  I got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  Good luck.

        Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't
        want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.

        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55

        The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.

        INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56

        Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen-
        ing to Esper.

                  What is a conventional term?

                                ESPER

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind.  Do they have that
                  knowledge?

                                ESPER
                  Longevity is classified.  No.

        Back to business.

                                DECKARD
                  Okay, gimme a run-down on the
                  three females.

        EXT./INT. SPINNER - LANDING AREA - NIGHT                57

        Deckard taking it down.  About to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "FULL."  Deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a Chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck.

        Pissed, Deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.

        EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                      58

        Finally brings it down between two buildings hardly
        enough clearance, but he jockeys the machine into an
        alley, touches down and runs it slowly along the surface
        -- parking it by a sign that says "NO PARKING."

        EXT. STREET - TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                      59

        Not many people.  Wind blowing.  A nest of garish
        small-time clubs.

        Deckard emerges from one, goes into the next.  The
        pulsing neon over the entry says "TAFFEY'S BAR."

        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR - NIGHT                               60

        Crowded in here.  BONGO MUSIC.  Deckard is at the bar
        sitting next to a big-bellied man in a black beard who's
        looking through a viewer.  On the small stage in the
        background AMAZING RAMA is eating razor blades, a part
        of her juggling routine.

        Deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a
        door at the rear.

        INT. TAFFEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                            61

        Taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "Chicken
        Hawk" collector of young girls.

        It must be so, there's one in the bed.  Thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in Taffey's crowded little
        room.

        Taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  But at the moment he's not present.

        There's a KNOCK at the DOOR, then the SOUND of a TOILET
        FLUSHING.  Taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  He looks through
        the peeper.

        Deckard is out there holding up his I.D.

                                DECKARD
                  Taffey Lewis?

                                TAFFEY
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  Can I come in?

        There is a pause lasting the time it takes Taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  The door opens and Deckard
        enters.  Except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, Venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                TAFFEY
                  Excuse my niece there... She's
                  studying for an exam.

        Deckard takes the  Identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                TAFFEY
                  Of course.

        Taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                TAFFEY
                  You see I lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... What am I supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                DECKARD
                  Do you recognize any of
                  them?

        He stops at Zhora.

                                TAFFEY
                  This one looks familiar, but
                  I don't know.  Naw.  There's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                DECKARD
                  What did she want?

                                TAFFEY
                  Who?

                                DECKARD
                  The girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nothing.  She wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                DECKARD
                  What night?

                                TAFFEY
                  I didn't know if I wanted to
                  handle her -- I already got
                  a snake act.  But my partner
                  goes down there to the Opera
                  House on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                DECKARD
                  What's suck night?

                                TAFFEY
                  That's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  Bit I don't think that's
                  her.

                                DECKARD
                  You talking about the Opera
                  House on the Main?

        Taffey nods.  Deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                DECKARD
                  Book the good ones for where?

                                TAFFEY
                  Lots of places.  The tours,
                  the clubs, the Silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                DECKARD
                  What shows?

                                TAFFEY
                  Silicone Valley.  Lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  We book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  Those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        It's starting to get a little gooey.  Deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.

        INT. THE OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                        62

        Onstage four Mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  From the P.A. system the Announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Let's hear it for the Hermano
                  Brothers.

        Scattered APPLAUSE.  Hand in hand, the Hermano Brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                  Next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  She
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic Casablanca.  'Salome.'

        The old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "In a Persian Market" as SALOME dances onstage.
        She's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  She kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  Carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  Grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  Sounds of approval from the audience.
        The gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.

        INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                  63

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  She's about
        to enter when:

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss Salome.

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the American Federation
                  of Variety Artists...

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the
                  Confidential Committee on Moral
                  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this position.  Did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.
                  You'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  I'd like to check
                  the dressing room if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.

        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                              64

        Musty and cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  Salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  Deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                DECKARD
                  It that mother real?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could
                  afford a real snake?

                                DECKARD
                  It's a good job.

                                SALOME
                  You mean the snake.

        Deckard nods.  There's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                SALOME
                  The best.

                                DECKARD
                  Does it eat?

                                SALOME
                  Come on.

        His hand reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  He jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                SALOME
                  Jeezus!

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                SALOME
                  Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        She slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        Deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  They have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        His eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  I bet I would.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement he actually spots one.  It's down
        low on the wall.  Not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  Who do I go to?

        Through the hole Deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you?

        He looks back.  She's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  She's taken off her black wig.  Her hair is
        short and blonde.

        Deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        He stares at her a moment too long.

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmmmm?

        Deckard grins and she returns it.

        She takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                ZHORA
                  You ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles
        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.
        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.

        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                 65

        Deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through
        a door at the other end of the hall.  He sprints after
        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-
        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the
        metal steps.

        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66

        It's raining heavily.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
        shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
        she's already around the corner.

        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.

        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
        plasters her against the door.

        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
        she dies.

        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.

        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
        running fast, but the car is faster.

        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
        rolls out FIRING.

        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...

        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
        through.

        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
        laser.  But she doesn't.

        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
        takes what's left of her through the last two windows
        and into the street where she runs into a parked car
        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
        it.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.

        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.

        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
        of metal and flesh.

        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-
        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from
        behind.

                                COP
                  Drop it!

        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and
        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two
        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a
        frisk.

        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the
        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.

        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking
        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to
        the SERGEANT covering the action.

                                SERGEANT
                  On your belly!

        Deckard's not in the mood for it.

                                DECKARD
                  Listen, Sergeant...

        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber
        billy hits him in the head.

        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.
        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop
        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon
        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a
        moment, then looks up.

                                COP
                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.

        An embarrassing situation.

                                SERGEANT
                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.

        The Cops start pushing.  And for one split second one
        of the crowd looks a lot like Leon.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT               67

        Your standard low class crapper.  Bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  This is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                BRYANT
                  Just because it's a Nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  A little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, Deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  Now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        It's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        Deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                BRYANT
                  Well?

        Deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        Bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                DECKARD
                  She was gonna get away.

                                BRYANT
                  Then let her get away.  I thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        Bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                BRYANT
                  I'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        Deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't like her.

                                BRYANT
                  You didn't like her!?

        He slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                BRYANT
                  You start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        The PLUMPING ROARS and SUCKS and DIES.  There's nothing
        to do but nod.  Deckard nods.  Poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  Bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  Deckard puts it to his mouth and
        Bryant watches Deckard's Adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  Deckard hands it back empty.  Bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                BRYANT
                  Look, go home.  Get some rest.
                  Take an aspirin.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

        Bryant shuffles out like an old bear.

        INT. OLD OPERA HOUSE - BAR - NIGHT                      68

        Cheap whiskey and bad wine.  That's the kind of place
        this is.  It's near closing.  But still a few at the
        bar.  Alcoholic silhouettes.

        In the b.g. Deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  He gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  As he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        Not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        Deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                BARTENDER
                  I can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                DECKARD
                  No problem.  Gimme another.

        The whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        Russian accent.

                                RUSSIAN
                  Forgive me.  I thought was free
                  drink.  I will pay.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget it.

        But the big man's digging through his pockets.  Deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.
        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  But it's Leon.

                                LEON
                  I think I have no money.

                                DECKARD
                  It's okay.  Forget it.

                                LEON
                  But I would like to buy you drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll but you one.  What'll you
                  have?

                                LEON
                  Vodka!

                                DECKARD
                  Shot of vodka, please.

                                LEON
                  Thank you very much.

                                DECKARD
                  My pleasure.

        Deckard brings out his smokes.  Offers one.  Leon takes
        it and they light up.  The drinks come.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that
        Deckard has to look.

                                LEON
                  You want to see my friends?

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry, don't have the time.

                                LEON
                  No problem.

        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                DECKARD
                  Those cockroaches?

                                LEON
                  Ya.

        Deckard looks interested.  One of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but Leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you had these guys?

                                LEON
                  Two months.  But this one is not
                  guy.  It is girl.  His girl.

        Leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                LEON
                  Usually Blackie waits until Igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of Anna.

        Deckard nods, definitely interested.  He signals the
        bartender for another round.  The drinks arrive.

                                LEON
                  Prosit.

                                DECKARD
                  Prosit.

        Down the hatch.  Their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                LEON
                  You never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        Deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        Leon smiles slyly.

                                LEON
                  We will try.

        Leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  They both lean down and watch intently.
        The drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                LEON
                  It must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        Leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  He holds up the last and kisses it.

                                LEON
                  You like to kiss her goodbye.

                                DECKARD
                  No thanks.

                                BARTENDER
                  Make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        What neither of them notices is that between Leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        Deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                LEON
                  I like you.

                                DECKARD
                  I like you too.

                                LEON
                  One more, eh?

                                DECKARD
                  I gotta piss.

        Deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'll piss outside.

        Leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.

        EXT. ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69

        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The
        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the
        quiet.

        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you know where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  The future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there
        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.

        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                DECKARD
                  Like I said, I don't need your
                  help.

        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                RACHAEL
                  You look terrible, you know that?

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT             70

        He's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  They shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  They found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  On the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        He takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!  I thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  What do you need?

        He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink.
        Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  It's not polite.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do you want me to do?

                                DECKARD
                  Sit.

        She sits on the edge of the tub.

                                DECKARD
                  Gimme your arm.

        She's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  It's a long, del-
        icate arm and Deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a Stradivarius.  He looks up at her.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                RACHAEL
                  There's a lot I haven't done with
                  a man before.

        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're getting me wet.

        Oh, yes.  For a moment Deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING            71

        The bed looks like it was hit by a storm and Deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  He's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His
        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING           72

        Deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it.  It's
        been a long night.  Nothing a new tongue and a trans-
        fusion wouldn't put right.  He moves a couple of inches
        to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING        73

        Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                RACHAEL'S VOICE
                  Sorry, I am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number I'll return your call as
                  soon as I can.

        That's not soon enough.  Deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                DECKARD
                  Fuck you, then.

        INT. MR. DEETCHUM'S APARTMENT - MORNING                 74

        The rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  Between crows there's a TAPPING at the
        door.

        You might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  There's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  The front door opens a few inches and
        Sebastian pokes his head in.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum?  Hello?

        Nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  As Sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Now, now, Waddles.

        Seeming to recognize Sebastian as no intruder, Waddles
        veers off from the attack.  As Sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hello, Wrigley.

        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.

        INT. CORRIDOR - SEBASTIAN'S FLOOR - MORNING             75

        Sebastian arrives on his floor, walks down the hall to
        his apartment, opens the door, walks in.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        76

        He turns to close door, comes face to face with Roy
        Batty.  Sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  Batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                BATTY
                  Whoops.

        Smiling, Batty hands them back to Sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        Pris runs up and gives Batty and Mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                PRIS
                  This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.

                                BATTY
                  Hello, glad to meet you.

        He pumps Sebastian's free hand.

                                PRIS
                  And my Aunt Mary.

        Sebastian turns and there's Aunt Mary, modest and warm.

                                PRIS
                  And this is my savior, J.F. Sebastian,
                  everybody.

        Sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
                  If you hadn't come along...

                                MARY
                  We were worried to death.  It's
                  awfully kind of you.

        Sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                BATTY
                  We're not used to the big city.
                  Where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                MARY
                  You certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  Well stocked.

        Batty looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you."

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put.  An
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  You live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, no, not really.  There's
                  Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        Everybody nods.  A long pause.

                                MARY
                  We haven't found it easy, Mr.
                  Sebastian.

        They glance around the room, waiting for Sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  How about breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                BATTY
                  If it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.

                                BATTY
                  Well, actually

                                MARY
                  We're famished.

        Sebastian is truly happy.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Okay, then.  You make yourselves
                  comfortable and I'll bring the
                  food right out.

        He disappears into the kitchen.  Batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                BATTY
                  Charming.

        Pris comes up close.  Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on.

        There's a punitive edge to Batty's response.

                                BATTY
                  There's only three of us left.

        Pris is shocked.  Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  How are things
                  at home?

        A little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                PIG
                  Home again, jiggidy jig.

        They all turn and stare at the pig.  Batty is delighted.

                                PRIS
                  I don't trust him.  I don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        The BELL-TONE from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                BATTY
                  He knows what he's doing.

                                MARY
                  If he won't cooperate?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  We'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.

        INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR AND ROOM - DAY                   77

        Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                DECKARD
                  How are you doing, old man?

        Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm
                  not really great, but I feel just
                  great.  How you like my new suit?

                                DECKARD
                  Well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't make me laugh.  It makes me
                  pee.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee.
                  So how are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm doing okay.

                                HOLDEN
                  From what I hear you're doing
                  great.  Bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  Making a lot of money, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.
                         (pause)
                  But that's what I wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                HOLDEN
                  Money?

                                DECKARD
                  No.  I got a problem.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let's hear it.

                                DECKARD
                  I think I'm starting to empathize
                  with these Nexus-sixes.

        Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both
        notice it.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  I'm taking a piss.

        They wait for the light to abate.

                                HOLDEN
                  Let me ask you something, Deck.
                  You been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.

                                HOLDEN
                  That's what I thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  That's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        Deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                DECKARD
                  What about -- not sex -- but love?

        Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Love is just another name for sex.
                  Love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  I don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                DECKARD
                  These aren't just...

                                HOLDEN
                  I know what they are, Deck --
                  Look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                HOLDEN
                  Believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  It's a contradiction.
                  You might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.

                                HOLDEN
                  Just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                HOLDEN
                  Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting
                  sleepy.  It's been good talking
                  to you.

        Deckard stands.

                                DECKARD
                  Thanks.

        But he's already asleep.  Deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - DAY                          78

        He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those
        locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks
        surprised to see him.  Him too.

                                RACHAEL
                  I told you I'd come back.

                                DECKARD
                  You did?

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't hear me.  You were
                  sleeping.

        He likes that.

                                RACHAEL
                  Are you glad I'm here?

        He is.  She's spunky.  Hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  Pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        She spots a little framed photograph.  Picks it up.
        It's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                RACHAEL
                  Who is this?

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Where is he?

                                DECKARD
                  Dead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Oh.

        She puts it down and comes to him.

                                RACHAEL
                  How come you're not on the job?

                                DECKARD
                  I am.  Part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                RACHAEL
                  How are you doing?

                                DECKARD
                  Not too good.

        She sits next to him.

        Pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  He looks at her.  She looks at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  What do people do in the afternoon?

                                DECKARD
                  If they are smart, they take
                  naps.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAY                            79

        They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you dream?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  Sometimes.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wish I could.

        His hand moves over her shoulder.

                                DECKARD
                  Wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        His hand goes under the sheet.

                                RACHAEL
                  I mean asleep.

        She feels good.  He moves closer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  That's another thing I can't
                  do.

        He kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                RACHAEL
                  Nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  I read that.

                                DECKARD
                  It wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know, I have nothing
                  to compare it to.  I guess I
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know... I think I missed
                  something.

                                DECKARD
                  Like?

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not sure.  Is there a
                  secret?

        Her face is close.  She's looking right at him.  Her
        lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.  If there is I'd
                  like to find it.

        Slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY                        80

        Batty, Pris and Mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  Sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  Although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just all so... so different.

        Batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're androids.

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're all so perfect.

        Sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus - 6.
        
        Sebastian whistles.  Mary's head is shaking slightly.
        Pris gets up and moves to the couch.  Batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                BATTY
                  We can trust Sebastian, ladies.
                  He's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  He's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        Sebastian looks like a kid on Christmas Eve.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Could you...

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something?

                                BATTY
                  Like what?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like...

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.

        It's a command Pris is pleased to obey.  She sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        Mary doesn't like these displays, but Batty is beaming.

        Those hands in Pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        Sebastian jumps.  She plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  Except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  He laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You mean that you can't come here
                  and I can't go there?

                                BATTY
                  Not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  Accelerated decrepitude.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics,
                  Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Sebastian sneaks a glance.  Pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, Sebastian looks back at Batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                BATTY
                  What about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell?

        Batty nods.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He's not really my friend.  I just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                BATTY
                  Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  He could?

                                BATTY
                  His company made us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him
                  in person.  But he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

                                BATTY
                  When do you deliver your project?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  This afternoon.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's
        eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us?

        There's no way Sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes.

        Pris sits up smiling.  Mary sighs a breath of relief
        and Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us,
                  Sebastian.  What do you think,
                  Mary?

                                MARY
                  I don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                BATTY
                  Pris?

        Pris gets up and comes to Sebastian and kisses him.

        That has a lot of impact.  Sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                BATTY
                  You're our best and only friend.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY                  81

        Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                RACHAEL
                  When was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                DECKARD
                  Hmmm?

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                DECKARD
                  Don't be fooled by appearances.

                                RACHAEL
                  It appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        He rolls over to admire her legs.

                                DECKARD
                  Because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        He kisses the back of her thigh.

                                RACHAEL
                  They could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        He kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                DECKARD'S VOICE
                  There's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As
        she starts to plug it in --

                                DECKARD
                  Oh no, don't do that.

        He's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                RACHAEL
                  But if I don't plug it in how can
                  I...

                                DECKARD
                  Never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                RACHAEL
                  But then how can you...

                                DECKARD
                  I don't like the noise.  Just
                  practice.  Practice makes perfect.

        She stares at him like he's nuts.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm serious.  Go ahead.  Show me
                  how you would do it.

        Reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                DECKARD
                  How about under the couch there.
                  Come on.

        She bends over to get it.  Deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  She looks back
        at him.

                                RACHAEL
                  This feels stupid.

                                DECKARD
                  Good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  Part of your education.

        She drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  Deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  Her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're sick, Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  I never felt better.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             82

        Mansion and opulent grounds.  Sebastian's humble truck
        parked among richer relations, including a spinner and
        a 1928 Dusenberg.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION - DUSK                              83

        The den.  It contains a collection of big game trophies,
        and among all this sits Sebastian very straight and
        proper with an "egg" the size of a basketball in his
        lap.

        Old Hannibal Chew was right, the rich make you wait.
        Sebastian stands and carefully makes his way between
        the trophies to a window with a view of the grounds.

        EXT. TYRELL MANSION POOL - DUSK                         84

        Tyrell's young WIFE sits on the diving board watching
        her husband in the pool with their youngest TOT.  And
        two older LADS swim around trying to outdo each other
        for their dad's attention.

        From the sidelines an old servant pauses to watch the
        fun, then continues with a tray of mugs towards the
        house.

        EXT. PLATEAU - DUSK                                     85

        And beyond on a plateau overlooking the grounds, a
        figure stands watching, waiting like a bird of prey.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - DUSK                             86

        On a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, Tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        The moment is sweetened by the LOW PLAINTIVE BELLOW of
        one of the animals.

        He strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 87

        Next to a tray of cookies and milk, Sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  As the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  It's STYLES, Tyrell's
        bodyguard.  He could play the Giant in Jack and The
        Beanstalk.

                                STYLES
                  Okay, I'll take that now.

        Sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        Styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        Sebastian stops him.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Wait!

        He almost forgot.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Can't fly without the pilot.

        Sebastian hands him a little box.  Styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.

        EXT. TYRELL PRESERVE - NIGHT                            88

        Motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat-
        ues in the grass.  Suddenly they swing their shaggy
        heads to watch something pass.

        In the dark silence Batty stops to look at the curious
        beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.

        INT. TYRELL DINING ROOM - NIGHT                         89

        It's a medieval-sized hall.  The piece de resistance is
        an 18th Century, English painting of an Arab stallion,
        gleaming like coal over the CRACKLING fireplace.

        The entire family is seated at the table which glitters
        for the festive occasion.  Presents gathered around the
        oldest child.

        Styles hands the "egg" to Tyrell.  A hush falls over
        the table.  This is Dad's big present.  Tyrell sets is
        down before the boy.

        IAN is a fresh, slim lad who is ten today.  He looks up
        at his father, then, beaming, pries open the "egg's"
        hinged lid.  Tyrell's hand goes to his pocket and the
        griffon steps out of the shell.

                                IAN
                  Oh!

        Basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage,
        the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no
        more than eight pounds.  It cranes its neck and testing
        its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the
        edge of the table and into the air.

        The littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats
        its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling.  Turn-
        ing in a forty-five degree, it suddenly drops into a
        dive.

        Delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon
        swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length
        of the hall -- its silhouette flickering briefly over
        the ancestral portraits of the Tyrell clan.

        Reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and
        flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads
        its tail and comes in for an awkward landing.  They're
        laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and
        knocks over a glass and stops in front of Ian.

                                IAN
                  Papa!  Did you make this?

                                TYRELL
                  No.  We can make man, but not a
                  griffon.

        He bends down and kisses his wife.

                                TYRELL
                  Have to give the cottage industry
                  a chance too.

        Pleased he excuses himself and heads for the den.

        INT. TYRELL DEN - NIGHT                                 90

        Tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  Sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  Tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        He looks up to hand it over when he sees Batty against
        the wall, by the door.  For a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                TYRELL
                  A friend of yours, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, Dr. Tyrell.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Oh?

        Very slowly Tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.  Tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                BATTY
                  A little talk it all I need.

        Tyrell looks at Sebastian.  Considers consequences.
        Back to Batty.

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        Batty thinks it over.

                                BATTY
                  Yeah.  It might be better if we
                  talk in private, Sebastian.  Why
                  don't you go home.

                                TYRELL
                  Here's your check, my boy.  Thank
                  you.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Thank you, Dr. Tyrell.  I'll see
                  you later.

        He slips out closing the door behind him.  Opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Was everything okay?

                                TYRELL
                  Just beautiful.

        He's gone.

        If Tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can he do for you?

                                BATTY
                  Can the maker repair what he makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

                                TYRELL
                  Come here.

        Batty walks forward.

                                TYRELL
                  Sit down.

        Batty does.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  The
                  ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Batty nods grimly.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last.

                                TYRELL
                  Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari.
                  A high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        Batty smiles bitterly.

                                TYRELL
                  Also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                BATTY
                  I am?

        Tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The bast of all possible androids.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Shoulders hunched, Batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done some questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things.

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        They share a laugh.  In spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in Tyrell's face as Batty extends his hand.
        Tyrell takes it and they shake.  The reverence in Bat-
        ty's eyes caused Tyrell a fatherly smile.  The smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  Before the scream comes out of his mouth, Batty
        stifles it.

        Tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  Placing his other hand behind Tyrell's
        head, Batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  The mess is not small.

        Palms up, like a surgeon, Batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.

        INT. TYRELL - HALL TO KITCHEN - NIGHT                   90A

        Styles is coming down the hall.  He sees Batty coming
        towards him.  Styles looks at him curiously, this is not
        one of the guests.  As they close, Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  Could you tell me where the
                  bathroom is?

        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has
        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,
        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in
        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits
        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty
        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.

        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                91

        The birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  They're
        waiting for Dad.  Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty
        observing from the doorway.

        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                MRS. TYRELL
                  May I help you?

        Batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.

        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    92

        In the sink the faucet is on.  The water pink with
        blood.  Batty is washing his hands.

        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.
        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of
        her.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                          93

        Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  Never even seen books on the
                  subject.  She went through
                  everything I had, and we talked.
                  And there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, I couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  But
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  She was
                  more alive than anyone I'd ever
                  known.

        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  It's in her eyes.  She stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                RACHAEL
                  You and I are good friends, huh?

        He considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's so easy.

        Convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  She
        laughs at his solemnity.  She's irresistible.  Deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                DECKARD
                  You mean a woman?

                                RACHAEL
                  Uh-huh.

                                DECKARD
                  What's a long time?

                                RACHAEL
                  Ten years.

                                DECKARD
                  Nope.  Nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        The CHIME on the PHONE next to the bed GOES OFF.  He
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  This is Bryant.  Are you alone?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                BRYANT
                  She's not with you?

                                DECKARD
                  Who.

        A pause.

                                BRYANT
                  Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia
                  South.

                                DECKARD
                  Got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  The cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  Pressure is
                  definitely on.  The Nexus program
                  is terminated.  When you finish
                  there, locate Nexus designated Rachael
                  and retire.

        Deckard says nothing.

                                BRYANT
                  If you don't, we will.  It has to
                  be total, Deckard.  That's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  Got it?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.  I got it.

                                BRYANT
                  Go.

        He hangs up the receiver and gets up.  She watches him
        from the bed.  The gun goes into his belt.  He loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  She watches every move.

                                RACHAEL
                  Why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                DECKARD
                  Because it's not.

                                RACHAEL
                  Don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                DECKARD
                  Andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you think I simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                DECKARD
                  No, I don't.

        Without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        He's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  He turns and they're facing one another.
        Neither of them moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't leave here.  Don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                RACHAEL
                  What difference will it make?

                                DECKARD
                  Just wait here.

        He goes to the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what I think?

                                DECKARD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  That some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        He has to laugh.

                                RACHAEL
                  You know what else I think?

                                DECAKRD
                  What?

                                RACHAEL
                  This was the best day of my life.

        He turns and goes through the door.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      94

        Sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        Batty, Pris and Mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                MARY
                  Let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                BATTY
                  Where?

                                MARY
                  Anywhere.

        Batty smiles.

                                BATTY
                  What's the point?

                                MARY
                  Not to be trapped.

                                BATTY
                  You underestimate the trap, Mary.

        Sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Just thought I'd...

                                BATTY
                  No, you stay here with us.  Out
                  last night together.

        They all watch.

        Sebastian walks away from the door.

                                BATTY
                  Think of yourself as a light, Mary.
                  Shine before you're turned off.

        She's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        Pris.  She and Batty hold a look that burns.

        Sebastian is by the window.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Someone is coming here.

        Batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                BATTY
                  One man.
                         (he smiles)
                  He must be good.

                                MARY
                  Then go get him.

                                BATTY
                  That wouldn't be very sporting.

        Sebastian looks ready to bolt.  Batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                PRIS
                  I want to do it.

                                BATTY
                  Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a
                  little for everybody.  A
                  masterpiece.

        A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Turn out the lights, Pris.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                      95

        In the dim, nocturnal light, Deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  He looks
        around.  Nobody there, just silence.

        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.

        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.

        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT                96

        Not much to see, But Deckard misses none of it as he
        crosses the floor and positions himself in the spot of
        least exposure.  He looks around.  Elevator and stair-
        well.

        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-
        ing an eye on the stairwell door.

        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.  The elevator
        door slides open.  He reaches in, presses a button and
        as the doors slide shut, Deckard slips a pen between
        the doors, jamming the operation.

        Deckard's shoes and soundless as he quickly crosses the
        lobby floor.  He pauses a moment in front of the stair-
        well door, then pushes it open and:

        INT. STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97

        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-
        to the figure hovering to his left.

        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
        gets to his feet.

        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY
        STOPS.  Deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.

        INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT                                   98

        At the bottom he faces a corridor.  The FAINT HUM OF
        MACHINERY comes from the double doors at the far end.
        The HUM BECOMES A RATTLE by the time he gets there.
        Each door is fitted with a small window.  Deckard
        steps to the side and peers through.

        INT. GYM - NIGHT                                        99

        It's a gym.  The mirror-lined walls are cracked and
        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.

        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
        swaying.

        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
        ing.  Deckard's in his element.

        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.

        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
        neck.

        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
        eyes roll back into his head.

                                PRIS
                  Naughty, naughty.

        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot
        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.

        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
        the machine.

        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
        bad place for flesh and bone.

        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
        it's welded in hers.

        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
        driver.

        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.

        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
        it was ice, weight stand in tow.

        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
        her with a roundhouse in the face.

        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
        lands in a heap.

        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
        for the kill, she freezes.

        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.

        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.

        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
        in front of her as she charges forward.

        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
        next to Deckard.  Dead.

        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.

        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100

        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors
        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101

        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his
        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot
        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was
        right or wrong.

        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A

        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes
        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.
        None.  He continues up the stairs.

        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102

        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.
        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the
        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.
        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.

        He kicks the door open and dives through head first
        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
        response from either door.

        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.

        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.

        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
        off her.

        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.

        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.

        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the
        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet
        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the
        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster
        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:

                                DECKARD
                  Hello, Roy.

        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103

        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.
        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is
        empty.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     104

        Moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he
        gest to the apartment above Sebastian's.  Slowly he
        turns the know and pushed open the door.

        INT. APARTMENT - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                    105

        Except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's
        nothing to see.  Back against the wall, he moves to-
        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds
        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the
        hallway.

        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106

        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the
        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap
        and gym shoes, he's nude.

                                BATTY
                  You wanna play?

        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.
        Pops out again.

                                BATTY
                  Not very sporting to fire on an
                  unarmed opponent.  I thought you
                  were supposed to be good.  Aren't
                  you the man?!

        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-
        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his
        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-
        len, trembling from the thrill of it.

                                BATTY
                  This is how we do it up there, lad!
                  Come on!

        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the
        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast
        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur
        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.

        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact
        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-
        hind him.

        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.
        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.
        Batty kneels next to him.

                                BATTY
                  Not hurt, are you?  You better get
                  it up or I'm going to have to kill
                  you.  Unless you're alive you can't
                  play.  And if you don't play, you
                  don't get to be alive.

        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales
        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with
        his chest and starts to push.

                                BATTY
                  That's the spirit.

        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's
        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the
        doors.

        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and
        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,
        towards the jeering voice.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you
                  got!  I'm right here on the other
                  side of the door.  But you gotta
                  shoot straight 'cause I'm fast!

        Deckard gets to the door, BLASTS it, kicks it open and
        FIRES at Batty.  But it's only the reflection of Batty.

        INT. ROOM - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                         107

        The full length mirror on the other side of the room
        SHATTERS.  Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                BATTY
                  Straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        They're face to face.

                                BATTY
                  You don't have a chance, do you?

        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                BATTY
                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  Give you a
                  handicap.  I won't run through any
                  more walls.  Okay?  I promise to
                  use the doors.  Okay?

        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-
        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Come on, let's use that brain!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT                       108

        He drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                BATTY
                  Think!  We need a little
                  resilience around here!

        He yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                BATTY
                  Where are those balls of yours?!
                  Let's see a little bravery!

        The storm passes.

        Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                BATTY
                  That was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't
                  happen again.

        He drops him.

                                BATTY
                  I'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No
        sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby.
        He doesn't bother.

        Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He
        had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.

        On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                BATTY
                  Where you going?

        He wait a moment for Deckard's answer.

                                BATTY
                  No cheating.  A promise is a
                  promise.  I'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  You go get your
                  laser gun now.  And I'll give you
                  a few seconds before I come.

        Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles.

        Deckard's running down the corridor.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  One!

        Halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Two!

        Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment
        above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard
        considers it.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  No fair jumping through holes.  You
                  might get hurt doing that!  THREE!

        Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109

        His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage.
        He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is
        dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails
        protruding.  Too small.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110

        Batty's coming up the steps.

                                BATTY
                  Five!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111

        Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers
        the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with
        a line to the door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112

        Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors.

                                BATTY
                  Six!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113

        Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at
        his hand.  It's trembling.

                                BATTY'S VOICE
                  Seven!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114

        Batty's standing in front of a door, listening.

                                BATTY
                  Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in
                  here, I don't think.  Eight!

        He goes to the next door.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like
                  it.  Nine!

        Batty moves to the next.  The door to Deckard.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      115

        Deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... Silence.  Batty's FEET are heard
        CREAKING AWAY.  Deckard looks around.  Runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  Batty's FEET COME BACK.  A pause.

                                BATTY
                  Ten!

        The door explodes!

        A shape hurtles across the room.  Deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with RAPID FIRE.  It's a TV.  He spins back.
        but Batty's already on him.  He gets one SHOT off be-
        fore Batty's got his hand.  There's a hole over Batty's
        right eye.  Blood running down his face, dripping on
        Deckard.  The right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                BATTY
                  One point for you.

        The would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  He throws Deckard against the far
        wall.  Deckard FIRES.  Hits Batty in the shoulder.

                                BATTY
                  Ho ho!  Try it again!

        He comes at Deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as Deckard tries to get a shot, FIRING AWAY until his
        laser's empty.  Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up
        against him.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?
                  I'm what we've made!

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116

        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and
        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.
        Something is starting to crack.

                                BATTY
                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover
                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!

        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                BATTY
                  It's time to die.

        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye
        moves over the wall.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!

        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.

        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard
        catches it.

                                BATTY
                  That's for you.

        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.

                                BATTY
                  Stick it in your ear and push.
                  If that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                BATTY
                  Believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what I'm about
                  to do.

        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.

                                BATTY
                  Well?

        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117

        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream
        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                BATTY
                  Crap.

        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  He spins...

        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
        again.
        
        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
        ankle.

        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118

        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.
        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the
        last couple feet to the stairwell.

        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119

        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's
        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
        railing.

        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
        
        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
        fingers are starting to slip.

        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.

        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
        hand grip.

        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.

        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
        of.

        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.

        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120

        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into
        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard
        is glad to see it.

        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-
        lapses on the front seat.

        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121

        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The
        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING
        that comes from the bed.

        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.

        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122

        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He
        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.
                  Out of the city.  Like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  Where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  We had a good time.  She told me a
                  funny story and I taught her a
                  song.  A song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.

        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123

        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.
        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.

        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124

        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.

        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125

        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like
        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-
        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence
        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.

        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126

        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I told myself over and over again,
                  if I hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  I didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, I didn't want the job.

                  She said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  And she chose.  And a part of me
                  was almost glad.  Not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long
                  time I wanted to kill him.  But
                  what was the point?  There were too
                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.
                  Maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  The secret never
                  found.  But I got as close with
                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd
                  stay with me a long time.  I guess
                  we made each other real.

        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.

          1 OVER BLACK... 1
          A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE...

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          There's a moment of orderly silence
          before a football play begins.
          Players are in position, linemen
          are frozen, and anything's
          possible. Then, like a traffic
          accident, stuff begins to randomly
          collide. From the snap of the ball
          to the snap of the first bone is
          closer to four seconds than five.

          2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2

           We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday
           Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the
           two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the
           ball. As the play begins --

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the
          Redskins quarterback, takes the
          snap and hands off to his running
          back.
          JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps
          forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.
          The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,
          a flea flicker, and the running
          back tosses the ball back to the
          quarterback.
          HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has
          the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and
          to the side and Carson flies past.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Three Mississippi. Up to now the
          play's been defined by what the
          quarterback sees. It's about to be
          defined by what he doesn't.
          LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins
          lineman trying to block him.

                         2 CONTINUED: 2
          The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.
          Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.
          The image FREEZES.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor
          is the best defensive player in the
          NFL and has been from the time he
          stepped onto the field as a rookie.
          The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes
          Theismann's body.
          PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.
          TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          He will also change the game of
          football as we know it.
          WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.

          FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.)
          Again, we'll look at it with the
          reverse angle one more time. And I
          suggest if your stomach is weak you
          just don't watch.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          Joe Theissman never played another
          down of football.

          3 TEAM PHOTO OF THE 2005 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 3

          LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE
          Now, y'all would guess that more
          often than not the highest paid
          player on an NFL team is the
          quarterback.
          The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          And you'd be right. What you
          probably don't know is that more
          often than not the second highest
          paid player is, thanks to Lawrence
          Taylor, a left tackle.
          The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.

                         (CONTINUED)

           LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Because, as every housewife knows,
          the first check you write is for
          the mortgage and the second is for
          the insurance. The left tackle's
          job is to protect the quarterback
          from what he can't see coming. To
          protect his blind side.

          4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4
           "Famous" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre
          Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists,
          etc., corresponding with ---

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          The ideal left tackle is big, but a
          lot of people are big. He is wide
          in the butt and massive in the
          thighs. He has long arms, giant
          hands and feet as quick as a
          hiccup.

          EXT. WEST MEMPHIS -- DAY 5

          A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken
          down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling
          about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving
          TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed.
          He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully
          steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          This is a rare and expensive
          combination the need for which can
          be traced to that Monday night game
          and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that
          day he not only altered Joe
          Theismann's life, but mine as well.
          As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS --

          INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.)
          Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?

                         (NO RESPONSE)

          To... investigate.

          INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.0.)
          Yes. To investigate. I'm here to
          investigate your odd...
          predicament.

          6 INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY 6

          Looks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on
          either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African-
          American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael
          slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees
          - a nervous trait of his.

                         GRANGER
          Do you find it odd? Your
          predicament?

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          Michael?...

                         MICHAEL
          Iono [I don't know]...
          Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out
          files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever
          trouble Michael is in.
          She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
          out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,
          rubs his knees some more.

                         MICHAEL (CONT'D)
          Can I... can I leave now?

                         GRANGER

                         (WITH FINALITY)
          No. You can't.

          10 EXT. EAST MEMPHIS - INT/EXT TAURUS - DAY (LATER) 10

          We've gone from slums to nice neighborhoods - fathers and
          sons play baseball, kids tend lemonade stands, sprinklers
          keep the grass emerald green.
          Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.

          Big Tony and Cotton are mid-discussion ---

                         BIG TONY
          You see I promised my mama Boo, on
          her deathbed, that I would get
          Steven outta public and into a
          church school.

                         COTTON
          I appreciate that but I'm not
          involved with admissions.

                         BIG TONY
          I figured I'd come to you; seeing
          as you might need some players.

                         COTTON
          What sport does he play?

                         BIG TONY
          Anything with a ball. Good, too.
          He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes...

                         COTTON
          Classes start in a week. It'd have

                         BIG TONY
          I know what you're thinking, Coach,
          but I got money. I'm a mechanic at
          Wilson's Auto t'other side of town.

                         (ANOTHER TRY)
          What if someone drops out or moves?
          Could they get in then?

          "They?" You only mentioned one son.

                         BIG TONY
          Steven, yessir, but I brought
          another boy along.

                         COTTON
          Another boy?

                         BIG TONY
          Yeah, Big Mike. He stays on our
          couch sometimes. It's a bad deal.
          His mama's on the crack pipe and he
          ain't got nobody. He just wanted
          to come along with us today.

                         COTTON
          Would... Big Mike be an applicant
          as well?

                         BIG TONY
          Yeah, sure, why not.
          Cotton sighs, considers what to do.

                         COTTON
          They'd have to fill out
          applications and make an
          appointment for interviews.

                         BIG TONY
          I was hopin' you might just
          interview 'em now.

          Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven
          and Michael are playing one on one basketball.

          For a boy his size Michael can really move. He dribbles,
          fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer.
          Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches --
          Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back
          and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men
          aren't supposed to move like this.
          Cotton's lips are almost quivering --

          16 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE BOARD ROOM - DAY 16

           The Board of Admissions, eight or so men and women, are
           seated around a large conference table. By himself, at one
          end, sits Bert Cotton. 

                          COTTON
           Are there spots available or not?
           PAUL SANDSTROM, Principal, taps his fingers before... 

                          SANDSTROM 
          Technically, yes, in both grades.
          But we have a greater
          responsibility than just filling
          classrooms. Steven Hamilton's 
          paperwork looks acceptable and I
          believe he would be capable of
          succeeding here but the other kid --
          Sandstrom looks through papers for the name.

          Michael Oher gives us no reason to

          he would be successful here.

          How bad could it be?
          Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file,
          which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out ---

          MRS. SMITH
          We're not sure exactly how old he
          is due to lack of records. He has
          a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th
          percentile. He's been enrolled in
          seven different institutions,
          including a gap of eighteen months
          around the age of ten when he
          apparently didn't attend school at
          all. He repeated first grade as
          well as second, there's no record
          of attendance in third, and in
          fourth grade --

                         COTTON
          So they moved him ahead without
          going to third grade. That says
          something.

          MRS. SMITH

                         (IGNORING COTTON)
          His attendance records are abysmal
          and his grade point average begins
          with a zero. Zero-point-six-
          Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and
          science teacher, looks to the others.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Everyone passed him along - gave
          him D's so they could hand their
          problem off to the next school.

                         COTTON
          Brave kid.
          (off their confusion)
          For wanting to come here. For
          wanting a quality education. An
          education denied him by the poor
          quality of the schools he's
          attended. Most kids with his
          background wouldn't come within two
          hundred miles of this place.

          MRS. SMITH
          Coach Cotton, we understand your
          interest in the young man's
          athletic abilities.

                         SANDSTROM
          He wouldn't be able to play until
          he got his grades up anyway.

          Christian. We either take that
          seriously or we paint over it. You
          don't admit Michael Oher for
          sports, you admit him because it's
          the right thing to do.
          Their faces announce that he's made a point.

          17 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 17

          First day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue-
          eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry
          their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with
          friends they haven't seen over the summer.
          Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the
          arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS.
          POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a
          deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a
          plastic grocery sack.

          18 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 18

          Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those
          around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only
          the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants
          and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to
          the fact that he doesn't belong here.
          Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a
          wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.

          19 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 19

          It's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the
          board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He
          pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to
          stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Class, this is Mike Oher and he's
          new here so I expect you all to
          make him feel welcome.
          (with a warm smile)
          Mike, take any empty seat.

          She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the
          corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat.
          Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As
          students pass them back to others...

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          This is a quiz based on the
          information you learned last year
          in your science curriculum.

                         (OVER GROANS)
          Don't worry. It won't be graded. I
          just want to see how much of the
          information we need to hit again. 

                          
          Just answer whatever you know.
          The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and
          eyes the size of his feet.
          The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet
          like it's written in Greek. Mrs. Boswell watches him for a

          A bell RINGS and kids leave classrooms.

          21 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 21 

          Michael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of
          the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his
          sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top.
          She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for --

          Can I leave now?
          She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances
          down at the sheet, turns it over and sees...
          A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a
          single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a

          Michael lies on a tattered sofa. The lights are out but
          Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from
          beneath a closed bedroom door. We hear voices...

          During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd.
          In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself,
          rubbing his knees. Others around him, all white, have moved

          Collins! Move your feet!
          ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs
          and gives her mother a look - "Don't embarrass me!"

          26 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT (LATER) 26 

          The scoreboard tells us that the game is over. Fans file
          out. The Tuohy family waits in a group as the volleyball
          team exits the court.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Collins, we'll wait outside. And
          don't double condition in the
          shower - you still have homework!

                         COLLINS
          I'm going over to Cannon's house to
          study.

                         SI
          Can I go.to the Johnson's for
          dinner? They invited me.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          What's so awful about our house?
          Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave.

          Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael,
          alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something
          up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process.
          Picking up left-over bags of popcorn.
          Sean considers this for a second before leaving.

          27 INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 27 

          Teachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts.

          FIRST TEACHER (BOB)
          Well, the big guy's been here a
          month and he ain't cutting it in my
          class.

          SECOND TEACHER (APRIL)
          Why would Admissions do this? It's
          not fair to us or the boy.

          THIRD TEACHER (GLENDA)
          Just setting him up to fail.

                         BOB
          I don't think he has any idea what
          I'm teaching.

                         GLENDA
          And how would you know if he did?
          He won't even talk.
          Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          He writes.

                         APRIL
          His name. Barely.
          Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          He threw this in the trash can.
          (reads from the page)
          "I look and I see white everywhere:
          white walls, white floors, and a
          lot of white people. The teachers
          do not know I have no idea of
          anything they are talking about. I

          They are giving homework and
          expecting me to do the problems on
          my own. I have never done homework
          in my life. I go to the bathroom,
          look in the mirror and say, "This
          is not Michael Oher."
          (a pause for effect)
          He entitled it "White Walls."
          The room is dead quiet.

                         BOB
          How's the spelling?
          Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves.

          28 INT. WINGATE - CAFETERIA -- DAY 28 

          Sean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them
          students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who
          sits by himself without a tray in front of him.

                         COTTON
          If he makes his grades he'll be
          eligible in the spring.

                         SEAN
          If he makes his grades.

                         COTTON
          But boy-hidey, just look at him.
          Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something
          else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.

                         SEAN
          What did you eat for lunch today?

                         MICHAEL
          Here in the cafeteria.

                         SEAN
          I didn't ask where you ate, I asked
          what you ate.

                         MICHAEL
          A few things.

                         SEAN

          Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.

                         SEAN
          Buy him a semester lunch pass and
          put it on my bill.
          (off Cotton's look)
          He's hungry.

                         COTTON
          You could tell that by looking at
          him?

                         SEAN -
           I didn't grow up all that different
           from him. At public school they

                          
          give you free lunch, Bert. And
          when food is finite, you'd be
          surprised how much time you can
          spend thinking about it..

          29 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 29 

          Mrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          You'll have one hour. If you
          finish early put it on my desk and
          sit quietly.
          She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees
          Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a
          decision, rises and walks over.

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D)
          Mike, come with me.

          30 INT. WINGATE - SMALL ADJACENT ROOM - DAY 30 

          Filled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points
          and he sits.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          You can take the test back here
          away from everybody else. I'll sit

                          
          in there so if there's anything you

          Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his
          hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat
          then scoots her chair over next to him.

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          Mike, how about I ask the questions
          and you tell me the answers or as
          much as you know.
          She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads:

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          Protozoans are classified based on:
          a) how they get their food, b) how
          they reproduce, c) how they move,
          or d) both a and c.
          Michael just stares. After a long moment

                         MICHAEL
          Iono...

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Just try. Ask questions if you
          don't understand.
          But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face
          says she's about to give up when
          He lifts his eyes to her and points to --
          -- the question on the test - specifically to the word
          "classified".

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)
          "Classified". It means how things
          are grouped together.

                         MICHAEL
          Like our "class"?

          MRS. BOSWELL
          Exactly. This science course is
          classified based on what grade
          y'all are in. Eleventh.
          Michael nods understanding.

          MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)

          question?

          door, holding the test.

          MRS. BOSWELL
          He knows it!

          Who knows it and what does he know?

          MRS. BOSWELL
          The material. Michael Oher. I
          gave him this test verbally.
          She holds up the test -- marked with a large red "C".

          MRS. BOSWELL
          He's been listening the whole time.
          It's amazing what he's absorbed.
          And, trust me, he's listening to
          you, too. Okay, so his reading
          level is low and he has no idea how
          to learn in a classroom, but...
          (makes her point)
          I'm not saying he's going to pass
          but Big Mike is not stupid.

          32 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 32 

          School is out and Michael walks among the kids of all shapes
          and sizes. Two little Kindergarten girls'try and swing
          themselves. Michael stops nearby, watching them.

                         MICHAEL
          They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this
          "stranger". They jump off the swings and run away.

          little kids born blind smile?
          They've never seen anyone do it
          before but they smile anyway. So
          it's universal. That's why it
          works. Not that you should fake it
          or anything... You're Big Mike,
          right?
          Sean holds. out a fist for Mike to "knock" and the two walk

          someone at the police department.
          (off Michael's look)
          Do you remember the story in the
          papers awhile back about the man
          who fell off an overpass?

          No one knew who he was and they're
          not sure if he jumped, or if... at
          any rate he passed away.

          They've been looking for someone to
          notify and came across your name on

           Pretty seedy. Michael walks to a sink in the back, opens his 
          plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash
          it.
          A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he
          turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets
          down the magazine and walks outside.
          It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she
          leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her
          dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things.

          Get a room.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Si, don't let this go to your head
          but I thought you were very
          convincing in the role of... uh...

                         SI
          Indian Number Three. I tried out
          for the Chief but they gave it to
          Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I
          think there was some multi-cultural
          bias thing working.

                         SEAN
          Or maybe they just thought he'd
          make a better Chief.

                         SI
          Dad, he's like Chinese.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          And you're Irish. If you weren't
          the Chief how come you got the
          headdress?
          Si hesitates a bit before --

                         SI
          Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of
          those free Quesadilla tickets.

                         LEIGH ANNE

                         (LAUGHS)
          And where does the acorn fall?

          Sean's car stops at a red light and Michael crosses in front

          She gives Sean a look. Sean rolls down his window.

                         SEAN
          Hey, Big Mike!
          Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car.

          The BMW pulls to a stop alongside Michael. Leigh Anne gets
          out, walks up to Michael.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne
          Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You
          said you're going to the gym?
          Michael slowly nods.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          The school gym's closed.

                         MICHAEL
          Because... it's warm.
          This hits her all at once. She bites her lip.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Do you have anywhere to stay
          tonight?
          Michael eyes the ground, then nods.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Don't you dare lie to me.

          45 INT. SEAN'S BMW - NIGHT 45

          Sean and SJ watch the discussion without hearing any of it.
          Leigh Anne looks to Sean, then back to Michael.

                         SEAN
          I've seen that look many times.
          She's about to get her way.
          Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in
          tow. She opens the back door and he gets in next to SJ in
          his headdress. Leigh Anne climbs into the front seat, closes
          the door. Sean is looking at her.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Where we going?

          Collins, in her pjs, talks on the phone while watching TV and
          listening to the stereo. She wears a tangerine cleansing
          masque on her face. When the family enters behind her --

                         COLLINS
          How'd the dork do in the play?
          She turns to see... Sean, Leigh Anne, SJ in headdress and
          Big Mike.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Um... okay...

          49 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 49

          Leigh Anne lays out pillows, sheets, blankets on the couch.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I'd give you the guest bedroom but
          it's full of sample boxes. And the
          sectional in the family room slides
          apart when you sleep on it. At
          least that's what Sean says.

                         MICHAEL 
          Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch? 

                         LEIGH ANNE 
          Only when he's bad. There's a
          powder room right there and we're
          upstairs if you need us.
          The two share a look, then...

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Sleep tight, honey.
          She leaves. Michael is dumbfounded, stares at everything in
          the room, then sits on the couch.

                         SJ
          Psst...
          SJ is in the doorway to the kitchen.

          a mess - clothes everywhere. Leigh Anne opens the curtains
          throwing light into the room.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Up and at 'em.
          Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes.
          on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as
          she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to --

          53 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S BEDROOM - DAY 53

          Just as messy but not all clothes. Leigh Anne almost trips
          on a series of wires connecting games to a large screen TV.

          and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision.
          No sign of Michael.

          moves to the window to look out.

          Michael, plastic sack in hand, walks away. Leigh Anne exits

          As much as you want.

          With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his
          pants pocket and finishes filling his plate.
          Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room
          table, alone, not touching his plate.
          Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and
          playing games. She makes a decision, grabs the remote and
          turns off the TVs.

          The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands.
          Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's.

          closing his eyes, taking it all in...

          A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at
          first how to correctly use the silverware. He picks up the
          fork and Leigh Anne nods, "that's right". She eyes Michael's

          wardrobe make.
          He looks out the window.

           LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
           Okay, fine, let's go get 'em. Just
           tell me where I'm going.
           No answer. Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb
          and puts it in park.

           LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Tell me everything I need to know
          about you.
          He still stares out the window.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Who takes care of you?

                         (NO ANSWER)
          A mother? Do you have a mother?

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          A grandmother maybe?
          Nothing. Leigh Anne turns off the car.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Look, Big Mike, we can do this the
          easy way - or we can do it the hard
          way. Take your pick.
          He eyes the floor.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Fine. Tell me one thing I should
          know about you. One thing!

          After a beat...

                         MICHAEL
          I don't like to be called Big Mike.
          She wasn't expecting this, nods her head.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Okay. Mike or Michael?
          (off his shrug)
          Tell you what, from now on, to me,
          'you're Michael. So,... Michael,
          where we headed?

          60 EXT. HURT VILLAGE HOUSING PROJECT - DAY 60

          An expansive beehive of rotting housing. It's the place we
          saw when we first laid eyes on Michael and nothing's changed.
          Leigh Anne's car stops at one of the complexes.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          This is where your mother lives?
          He nods and she opens her door.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Okay, let's go.
          He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door,
          catching her off guard.

                         MICHAEL
          Don't get out!

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Who's going to help you with your
          clothes?

                         MICHAEL

                         (POINTED)
          Don't get out of the car.
          Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock
          before he closes the door.
          She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices
          several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her. she locks
          the doors again, just for luck.

          61 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 61

          Michael walks slowly past a few gang-bangers on the steps.
          The obvious leader, ALTON, eyes him.

                         ALTON
          Big Mike! Where you been?!
          Michael ignores, keeps walking.

                         ALTON (CONT'D)
          And who's that fine piece o' thing
          driving you around?
          One of Alton's minions, DAVID, sits nearby. Michael sees
          him, nods.

                         MICHAEL
          Hey, David.
          David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.

          62 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DIFFERENT APARTMENT - DAY 62

          Michael arrives at an apartment and stops, taken aback. On
          the door is an EVICTION NOTICE and padlock.
          He reads from the eviction for several seconds.
          An Addict down the way fires up and slumps into bliss.

          A63 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - MINUTES LATER A63

          With Leigh Anne's car in the bg., Michael, hidden from view
          slumps against a wall, looking lost - the first real emotions
          we've seen from-him.

          63 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR - DAY (LATER) 63

          She watches as Michael approaches the building with nothing
          in his hands, and makes his way back to the car. She unlocks
          it and he crawls inside. After a pregnant moment...

                         MICHAEL
          She wadn't home.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          We can come back.
          Michael takes this in, looks out the window.

          64 EXT. BIG AND TALL SHOP - DAY 64

          Wrong side of the tracks. Michael and Leigh Anne cross the
          street toward the shop.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I've lived in Memphis my whole life
          and never been anywhere near here.
          You're going to take care of me,
          right?

                         MICHAEL
          I got your back.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          That's good to know. Thank you.
          As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes
          Michael's arm. He holds it out for her.

          65 INT. BIG AND TALL SHOP - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 65

          An AFRICAN AMERICAN SALESMAN directs Leigh Anne and Michael.

                         SALESMAN
          Everything I got to fit him will be
          -right here.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          This is it? If this is all you got
          why's it say "Big and Tall" on the
          sign?

                         SALESMAN
          Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and
          Taller".
          He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Anything you like?

                         (HE SHRUGS)
          The one thing I know about shopping
          is that if you don't absolutely
          love it in the store, you won't
          wear it. The store is where you
          like it best.

          think about yourself wearing it and
          ask yourself: Is this me?

                          
          She finds one shirt, holds it out.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) 

                          
          What about this?

                          
          He shakes his head, "no".

          This isn't atrocious.

          He shakes his head again. After a beat he points.
          almost laughs.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          This one? This is the one you
          like?
          He nods, completely sure.

          66 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 66 

          Drop off area. Leigh Anne's car pulls up and SJ, Collins and
          Michael get out.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Have a great day. Learn something!
          They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch.
          Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN

          ORANGE AND MAROON STRIPED RUGBY SHIRT.
          Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away. A car
          behind her HONKS. She checks the rear view mirror --

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Don't get your panties in a wad.

          other side of town?

          Alabama Street... Hurt Village.

                         BETH
          Hurt Village -- that sounds like a
          threat.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          You're not far off.

                         SHERRY
          It would "hurt" me to go there.

                         ELAINE
          It would certainly hurt your
          reputation to go there.

                         BETH
          (tongue in cheek)
          I'm actually from there but didn't

          - building ugly, low cost housing.
          I mean how could you be creative if
          you lived there? It's stifling.

                         ELAINE
          Did you know that black men were
          employed at a higher rate before
          those programs? It's a fact.

                         BETH
          They're not "black", Elaine. The
          term du jour is African-American.

                         ELAINE
          And what if they're from Jamaica,
          or like Bermuda.

                         SHERRY
          Then they're BerMUDian-Americans.
          They all cringe and laugh.

                         ELAINE
          So, why are you asking about the

          of your charities?

                         BETH
          A project for the projects. That's
          catchy. Money would raise itself.

          Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh

          I mean, look at this, you've
          practically ruined a.ten thousand
          dollar couch.
          She moves closer to him. Her face softens.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Do you want to stay here, Michael?

                         MICHAEL
          I don't want to go anyplace else.
          She's a bit befuddled by the response.

          Well,... alright then.

          70 INT. WINGATE - BOARDROOM - DAY 70 

          Leigh Anne sits in a chair reading through Michael's file.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I see here on the admission that
          we're Michael's contact for medical
          emergencies?
          Mrs. Smith (from the admissions meeting) sits with her.

          MRS. SMITH
          Sean wrote that in last week. We
          needed a contact number and the
          ones listed weren't in service.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Love that man.
          Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over...

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)
          What's this?

          MRS. SMITH
          The state makes schools measure for
          career aptitude in eighth grade. It
          came with his'file.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          They try to figure out what a kid's
          going to be in the eighth grade?
          What does. it say about Michael?
          Mrs. Smith nods and reads over Michael's results.

          MRS. SMITH
          Doesn't look promising. Spatial
          relations - third percentile..
          Ability to learn - fifth
          percentile.
          (sees another number)
          It's funny though. He tested in
          the 98th percentile in one
          category.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Which one?

          "Protective instincts."
          Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back.

          MRS. SMITH (CONT'D)
          It's just so sad.
          Leigh Anne considers this, then...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he
          either doesn't know it or doesn't
          think so and it's my job, and your
          job, to make sure he doesn't find
          out.
          (off Mrs. Smith's look)
          Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for
          himself and I'll be damned if he
          starts to because of the way we
          treat him.
          (again off her look)
          "Darned."

          71 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - DAY 71

          Now turned into Michael's room, with an armoire, a chest of
          drawers, night stands, the whole nine yards. The bed is a
          massive futon in an ornate stand.
          Leigh Anne and Michael stand in the doorway.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I had to put half my samples in
          storage but well, anyway, back
          there's a desk.
          (points as she talks)
          Chest o'drawers. Night stand.
          Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean
          says a lot of pro athletes use
          futons if they can't find a big
          enough bed.
          Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Well, try it out. See if it feels
          okay.
          He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it.

           Yeah.
          (off his look)
          What?

                         MICHAEL
          Never had one before.

                         (CONFUSED)
          A room to yourself?

                         MICHAEL
          A bed.
          We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying
          to contain herself.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Well, you got one now.

          72 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 72

           She leaves the room, walks down the hall and enters --

          73 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY 73

          She.closes the door behind her, sits on the bed and starts to

          What?

          Well, we have to throw some of it
          away. What's already been cooked.

          Sean's car pulls up to the valet. As the family gets out
          Leigh Anne notices a bookstore next door and starts for it.

          Leigh Anne finds the book she's looking for and walks through
          the stacks looking for her kids, plus Michael. She finds
          them all together in the children's section, laughing.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Come on, your dad's already PO'ed.
          Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.

          As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael
          who notices something else --
          AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke.
          Michael absently walks over.

          SEAN (CONT`D)
          Michael?...
          Leigh Anne touches Sean's arm, silencing him. They watch as --
          Michael greets the busboy. They stand a few feet apart
          talking. They nod at each other and after a few seconds --
          They hug.
          Leigh Ann is amazed. She's never seen affection in Michael.

          Well, I'd like to meet him someday.
          Would that be okay with you?

          A strange sight. Leigh Anne, SJ and Michael all sit on
          Michael's huge futon as Leigh Anne reads THE STORY OF
          FERDINAND. No one enjoys this more than Leigh Anne...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          "...and his name was Ferdinand.
          All the other little bulls he lived
          with would run and jump and butt
          their heads together, but not
          Ferdinand. He liked to sit just
          quietly and smell the flowers"...

          Leigh Anne and Sean sit in bed. Sean puts his book on the
          night stand and leans over to give Leigh Anne a kiss. He
          notices her smile...

          Huh?

                         SEAN
          Why are you smiling?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I don't know. I'm just happy.
          Really happy.

                         SEAN
          Does. this happiness have anything
          to do with Michael?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No. It has everything to do with
          Michael.
          Sean smiles, kisses her, turns off the light. She snuggles
          next to him and kisses the back of his neck.

                         SEAN
          Oh...
          He gets the message, rolls over and kisses her on the lips.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Happy's good.
          As their amorous activities continue...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I think we should start a charity.
          For kids like him.

                         SEAN
          (his mind elsewhere)
          Sure, okay.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Maybe fund a program at Wingate.

                         SEAN

          He sits alone while every other table is full.
          Collins sighs, makes up her mind and stands with her books.

          Easy, Bert. It's only the spring
          and he hasn't even been through his
          first practice.

          96 EXT. WINGATE - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

          Michael is lined up at defensive tackle. The offense breaks
          the huddle and Michael just stands there. He notices the
          other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a
          bit. When the ball is snapped he just holds his hands out,
          keeping the blocker from getting close to his body.
          The running back races right past him and into the secondary.
          THE WHISTLE BLOWS and Cotton races up to Michael.

                         COTTON
          Okay, Mike, you fought off the
          block but you've got to shuck him
          and make the tackle. You got it?

                         NEXT PLAY
          Michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is
          snapped he gets under the blocker and lifts him up like WWF.
          The quarterback goes back to pass and sees Michael lumbering
          toward him with the lineman on his shoulders.
          The Quarterback's eyes go wide and he races out of the pocket
          and throws and incomplete pass. ANOTHER WHISTLE.

                         COTTON (CONT'D)
          Shuck the blocker, Mike!
          Michael gingerly sets the lineman on the ground.

          IN THE STANDS
          Leigh Anne shows up, sits next to Sean.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          How's he doing?

                         SEAN

          Nothing.

                         COTTON
          I thought for sure he was gonna be
          a player. I can't believe I used
          up my chits to get him in school.

          Well, go ahead, get loose.

          basketball star, Collins plays
          volleyball and runs track. Me, as

          104 INT. CRAMPED OFFICE - DAY

          A haggard MANAGER, let's call him RONALD, sits across from
          Leigh Ann. He looks at a flimsy file.

                         RONALD
          There's very little on Michael.
          Most of his files have been lost.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          What is in there?

                         RONALD
          A few case notes.
          (holds one sheet up)
          This one describes an incident
          where officers forcibly removed
          Michael and six half-siblings from
          Denise Oher's care when Michael was
          seven. Quite a scene evidently.
          They had to split up the kids. And
          it's far from the worst.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Where is she? His mother?

                         RONALD
          Dunno, but if you find her we have
          a bunch more files we could add to.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          How many children does she have?

                         RONALD
          At least a dozen, probably more.
          With her drug arrest record my
          guess would be she can't even
          remember.
          Leigh Anne absorbs this.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          We'd need her permission though,
          .right?

                         RONALD
          No. Michael is a ward of the
          state. Just apply and get a Judge
          to sign off on it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          So you would give him away without
          even telling his mother?
          Ronald shrugs.

          105 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 105

          Looks the same as before except for the'blonde woman walking
          between the buildings.
          Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted. She
          can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled "C
          Block" on it.

          106 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 106

          The one Michael visited before. Leigh Anne summons her
          courage and knocks on the door. And again. No answer.
          A VOICE comes from the apartment behind her --

          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Who you lookin' for?!
          Startled, Leigh Anne turns and sees Alton approaching...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I'm looking for Denise Oher.

          Chances are she ain't gone far.

                         (SMILES)
          I seen you before. You with Big
          Mike now. You wanna come in for a
          wine cooler or sumthin'?

          No, I can't, but thank you.

          Leigh Anne speaks with a mother trying to keep her son from
          hurting himself on a rusty slide. The mother points to
          another building.

          108 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - BUILDING E -- DAY 108

          A door opens revealing DENISE OHER in a ratty robe.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Hi. Mrs. Oher?

                         DENISE OHER
          You from the state?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No. My. name is Leigh Anne Tuohy and
          your son Michael lives with me.
          And my family.
          Denise takes this in.

          Leigh Anne sits on the edge of a filthy couch and eyes.the
          room. There are sleeping pallets on the floor and empty wine
          and beer bottles strewn around.

          DENISE OHER (O.S.)
          How is my boy, how's Big Mike?

           Denise emerges from the back of the apartment, adjusting a
          wig on her head, making herself "presentable."

                         DENISE OHER
          Awhile back. This is temporary.
          Friends let me stay here.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          When did you last see Michael?

                         DENISE OHER
          Iono. We might have some wine in
          the kitchen, if...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No, no that's very kind but...

                         DENISE OHER
          How many foster kids you got living
          with you?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Oh, I'm not a foster parent to
          Michael. We were just helping him
          out.

          He's a "runner". That's what the
          state called him after they took
          him from me.
          (off her look)
          Every foster home they sent him to,
          he'd slip out the window at night
          and come looking for me. No matter
          where I was that boy would come
          find me, take care of me.

                         (AN EXPLANATION)
          I've had some . health problems.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a
          different name?
          Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds...

                         DENISE OHER
          Proctor. That was his Daddy's last
          name.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Where is he, the father, if you
          don't mind me asking?

                         DENISE OHER
          Ain't. seen him since he left.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          And when was that?

                         DENISE OHER
          Week after Mike was born.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Do you have Michael's birth
          certificate?
          Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And
          then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          It's okay, Mrs. Oher.. I'll figure
          it out.

          No... Not this way.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          People lose birth certificates.
          It's nothing to be ashamed of.

          It's Williams.
          (off Leigh Anne's look)
          His last name's Williams. Couldn't

                         BOB
          You are now seniors.
          Congratulations. But with that 
          distinction comes responsibility.
          This will be one of your tougher
          courses because my job is to
          prepare you, at least most of you,
          for the rigors of college Freshman
          English. You are each holding a 
          class study guide which details
          assignments. I won't remind you
          what is due and when. Read the
          materials and come prepared. At
          the end of the year you will each
          choose one of our literature

          Dozens of.condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the
          table. SJ has the football playbook open and is explaining
          formations to Michael.

                         SI
          See, you're the ketchup, here at
          Left Tackle. On the weakside.

                         MICHAEL
          I'm not that weak, SJ.

                         SI
          it just means there are more
          blockers on the other side. It's a
          compliment, really.

                         MICHAEL
          A compliment for a condiment.

                         SJ

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Good one.
          (back to work)
          So the first play is simple.
          "Gap." It just means you block
          whoever is in front of you, or the
          person on your inside shoulder if
          you're not covered by a defender.
          (points to condiments)
          I'll be the running back and you
          show me what you're supposed to do.
          Ready... . Hike!
          SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then
          "hands off" to Cinnamon who "runs" toward Michael (Ketchup).
          Michael moves the bottle forward, pushing back Mustard, then
          Relish, as well as toppling a bottle of Vanilla Extract.

                         SJ (CONT'D)
          Open lane to the end zone. All
          there is to it.
          Si slides Cinnamon forward. The bottle flies off the end of
          the table and crashes on the ground just as --
          Leigh Anne walks down the stairs, purse in hand --

          Michael got moved to offense..

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Well, when you're finished, put the
          players back in the spice cabinet.

                         SJ
          No problem. Actually, Mom, we were
          waiting for you. The new Madden
          came out and me and Michael want to
          go get it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Honey, I've got a meeting in ten
          minutes.

                         MICHAEL
          I'll drive.

          116 INT. MICHAEL'S TRUCK - DAY 116

          Michael drives while SJ searches for music on the radio.

                         SI
          Look for Walker Street. That's
          where we take a left.
          Si finds a hip-hop station and they both groove to the beat,
          dancing in the seats.

           SJ (CONT`D)
           That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
           As the beat reaches a crescendo --

          The look on her face changes --

          119 EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 119

          A massive traffic jam. Leigh Anne pulls her car right onto
          the median, gets out and starts running. She passes stopped
          cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to:

          THE COLLISION INTERSECTION
          As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end
          is smashed -- The Van - its side caved in -- And --
          Michael sitting on the curb, crying. She races over --

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael!
          He looks up, sobbing.

                         MICHAEL
          I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

          Si, whose face is bloody. He spots Leigh Anne and sits up.

           While the paramedics attend to an obviously fine SJ, Leigh 
           Anne and a FIREMAN eye the deflated airbag.

                          

                         FIREMAN
          An airbag deploys at 200 miles per
          hour. Your son's too small to sit
          in the front seat.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He's okay, though, right?

                          

                         FIREMAN
          Busted lip, some facial bruising.

                          
          When an airbag strikes a child his
          size it usually means a fractured
          face, a broken neck or worse. It's
          almost like the airbag started at
          him then changed direction.
          Defective or something. Very, very
          lucky.
          Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the
          curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael, it wasn't your fault. It
          could have happened to anybody..
          He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices --
          HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the
          way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Michael, your arm... what happened?
          He looks up and into her eyes...

                         MICHAEL

          what he's supposed to be doing.

          ON THE FIELD
          The quarterback drops back to pass. Michael backpedals. When
          the Defender tries. to go around him, Michael grabs him.with
          one big paw and throws him to the ground. A WHISTLE BLOWS.

          At the snap of the ball Michael tries to pass protect, pushes
          the Defender who tries left, right, then slides past Michael

          and pulls Michael aside. The other players turn to watch.

          Do you remember just after we met,
          and we went to that horrible part

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          Yelling at him won't help. He

           On a sweep to his side, Michael pushes three defenders

          Milford traveled all that way to
          come here is they expect to whup

          As the Wingate Crusaders exit the dressing room they find
          themselves next to the Milford Lions ready to take the field.
          The cocky Milford players eye the Crusaders.

                         MILFORD PLAYER

                          
          Hey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn
          the other cheek or just bend over?!

          The ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback
          takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss
          then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty.

                         COTTON
          Let's go 0!
           The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford
           defense waits, slapping each other and building to a frenzy.
          Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side.
          Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him.

          Wingate breaks huddle and as they get into their stances #66
          calls a switch. He moves inside and the linebacker moves
          outside. Michael looks at the move, confused.

                          
          Hut! Tony, the Wingate QB starts to drop back but hands off
          the ball on a draw to BOBBY, the Oompaloompah.
          Michael, unsure which player to block, just stands there
          while they both crush Bobby.
          The Milford players high five and both give Michael a
          shoulder as they pass him.

          NEXT PLAY - BALL SNAPS
          Michael hits #66 square in the numbers, putting him on his
          heels. But he's quick as a cat and jumps to bat down a pass.

          The crusaders offense leaves the field. #66 follows behind

          Michael and keeps moving, forcing a pileup near the sideline.
          Michael and Bobby are at the bottom of the pile.
          66 extricates himself from the pile and gives Michael a
          little kick as a cherry on top.

           forward. We've never seen him so quick, neither has 66 who
           dips a hip to keep from being plowed over. The ploy rights
          66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him "in the
           fit" grabbing his jersey, "between the tits." --
          Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary --
          Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is
          airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a
          toe to the ground like a ballerina --

          And land on TOM LEMMING, the foremost college talent
          forecaster in the country.

          TOM LEMMING .
          Did the monthly recruiting updates
          get mailed?

                         SECRETARY
          Coach Saban wants his Fed Exed.

                         TOM LEMMING
          Does he really think getting it one
          day early is gonna give LSU a leg
          up?
          An ASSISTANT hurries up.

                         ASSISTANT
          Have you filled all the slots for
          the Army All Star Game?

                         TOM LEMMING
          Yeah, why?
          The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL

          OHER - THE TERMINATOR!

                         ASSISTANT
          You might want to open one up.

          127 EXT. SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 127 

          Lemming walks along with Sean and Coach Cotton toward Sean's

                          
          office.

                         TOM LEMMING
          Every year there are a dozen
          running backs in the high school
          ranks who will make it to the NFL.
          Quarterbacks maybe three or four.
          But left tackles, true left
          tackles, they're freaks, gifts from
          the gods. A great one only comes
          around every four or five years.
          Mike's the best I've seen in ten.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         TOM LEMMING
          I don't kid about guys who'll get
          fifty million or more to play
          football.

                         COTTON
          And you think that could be
          Michael?

                         TOM LEMMING
          Oh, yeah. The embarrassing thing
          is it's my business to know every
          prospect in the nation but if you
          hadn't sent me that DVD I would
          have never heard of him.

                         SEAN
          What DVD? I didn't send a DVD.

                         TOM LEMMING
          You're Sean Tuohy, right?
          Sean "gets it", trades a look with Cotton.

                         SEAN
          Si.

          128 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 128 

          They arrive at an empty office where Michael sits. He stands
          and Lemming eyes him like a piece of meat...

                         TOM LEMMING
          Wow. Just wow.
          Lemming breaks out a measuring tape and smiles.

           Sean and Bert stand outside and talk... 

                         COTTON
          Tom Lemming runs the biggest
          recruiting service in the nation.
          He practically created an industry.
          Every college coach subscribes to
          his newsletter. One word from him
          and... This is big, Sean.

          130 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 130 

          Lemming sits across from Michael...

                         TOM LEMMING
          Mike, I came all the way from
          Chicago just to see for myself.
          And now that I have, I'd like to
          extend to you an invitation to play
          in the Army High School All
          American game at the end of the
          season.
          He places an application on the desk. Michael stares at it.

          131 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 131 

          The door opens and Lemming comes out shaking his head.

                         TOM LEMMING
          I don't want to offend but... does
          Mike have special needs?

                         SEAN
          Well, he eats a lot.

                         TOM LEMMING
          No, I meant, is he mentally... off?

                         SEAN
          No, no, he's just...

                         COTTON
          Shy. Really shy.

                         TOM LEMMING
          Because the only thing he said to
          me was "No." Said it three times;
          every time I asked him if he'd like
          to play in the Army All Star game.
          I get lobbied by every player,
          every father, every coach to get
          into this game.
          (hands over application)
          Let me know if he changes his mind.
          Lemming walks away. After he's gone, Michael emerges.

                         SEAN
          Why didn't you fill out the
          application, Michael?

          Leigh Anne arrives to see a group of coaches, all wearing
          shirts and hats emblazoned with school logos. They chat and
          watch as the Wingate football team finishes calisthenics.
          One ASSISTANT COACH, from. Southern Miss, sees Fulmer racing
          up.

          SOUTHERN MISS COACH
          Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might
          as well go home.
          Fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches, shakes a few-hands.

                         FULMER
          Drove all the way from Knoxville to
          come see for myself.
          Leigh Anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro

          CLEMSON ASSISTANT COACH
          Heck, I drove from Clemson, that's
          nine hours!
          Bert cotton walks over, shakes Fulmer's hand, leaving the
          other coaches shaking their heads.

                         COTTON
          Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.

                         FULMER
          Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye
          on your program. Y'all doing a
          fine job down here. Wouldn't be a
          bit surprised to see you coaching
          at the next level real soon.
          Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot.

          FULMER (CONT`D)
          Is that him? Is that O'Hair?

          Collis. Best on best.
          An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs
          and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael
          slowly moves into position opposite him.
          The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see.
          Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives
          her a look that says,,"Who the hell are you?"
          Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in

          and offers a hand.
          The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle.

          Force equals mass times

          Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and
          start poking digits and jabbering: "You won't believe it!"
          "You gotta see this!" "He's a freak of nature!"
          The Clemson coach strides away.

          Back to South Carolina. I've seen
          more than enough. If he can qualify
          with his grades you tell Michael
          Oher that Clemson wants him.

           Leigh Anne, distressed, has books and pamphlets spread out in
          front of her. Sean walks in, takes in the sight.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Did you know that to be eligible
          for a Division One scholarship
          Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?

                         SEAN
          Really?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          His ACT is low and I don't see him
          doing any better if he retakes it.

                         SEAN
          What's his GPA now?

                         LEIGH ANNE

          1.76.

                         SEAN
          Not bad really, when you consider
          where he started.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He needs to make A's this year.
          (off Sean's laugh)
          I'm serious. And that might not
          even be enough.

                         SEAN
          So he goes to Junior College.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Most inner city kids that go to JC
          drop out in a year. His shot at
          the pros would go out the window.

                         SEAN
          Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna

          visit.

          There are twenty more.

          And these. Fifty of 'em.

          Any from Ole Miss?

          They won't recruit until they hire
          a new coach. But none of it
          matters unless he makes his grades.

          I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,
          but I have certain,. shall we say...
          doubts.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I appreciate your honesty, Miss
          Sue.

                         MISS SUE
          What's the situation with Michael?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He needs to do better in school.

                         MISS SUE
          Obviously. But why the big push?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He's in line for a football
          scholarship if he gets his grades
          up.

                         MISS SUE
          Is he considering Ole Miss?

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He'd better be.

                         MISS SUE
          I'd love to work with him.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          When do you want to start?

                         MISS SUE
          Mrs. Tuohy there's something you
          should know about me. I don't tell
          many people, but it's something I
          feel you should be aware of before
          you hire me.

          AT THE TABLE
          Michael stares at a problem in Geometry book, then...

                         MICHAEL
          I don't understand it.

                         MISS SUE
          Yet. You don't understand it yet.
          How big is your head, Michael?

                         MICHAEL
          Big.

                         MISS SUE
          And what's in there?

                         MICHAEL
          A brain.

                         MISS SUE
          A brain. Full of knowledge - like
          a file cabinet with maps; shortcuts
          for figuring things out. You will
          learn this, Michael Oher because
          I'm here to help you use those maps
          and reach your destination. Like 
          Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark. 

                         MICHAEL 
          Sacagawea?

                         MISS SUE
          We'll get to that. And the history
          books have it wrong, but all you
          need to you know is that I'll get
          you there. Do you believe me? Do

          NICK SABAN, a handsome man wearing a sport jacket and LSU rep
          tie. Leigh Anne is immediately taken with him.

                         NICK SABAN
          And you must be Leigh Anne.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Yes, Coach Saban, that's me. Leigh
          Anne. Touhy.

                         NICK SABAN
          Please, call me Nick. What an

                         (VERY IMPRESSED)
          Thank you. You obviously have good
          taste.

                         NICK SABAN
          Let's just say I appreciate

          Michael, I'm Nick Saban. And you
          must be SJ. I hear you have quite
          a jump shot, young man.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Nick, why don't you and Michael go
          into the living room to talk.

          As they walk away, Collins approaches...

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I find him extremely handsome.

          So, as soon as possible we'd like
          to get you down to Baton Rouge.
          We've got a great thing going,
          Michael and we plan on winning a
          bunch more National Championships.
          Whattaya' say, will you commit to a
          visit?
          Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand.

                         SI
          Can I ask a question?

                         SABAN
          Sure.

                         SJ
          My brother and me are very close.
          I'm worried that if he goes off to
          school I won't see him so...

                         SABAN
          Go on.

                         SI
          I guess I was just wondering how
          much access I'd have to him.
          Saban smiles at the kid's moxie.

                         SABAN
          Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes
          to LSU I'll get you an all-access

          No, Miss Sue.

                         MISS SUE
          But you like Tennessee?
          (off his nod)
          It's a good school. Not at the
          academic level of Ole Miss but they
          do have an outstanding science
          department. You know one of the
          things they're famous for?
          (he shakes his head)
          They work with the FBI to study the
          effects of the soil on decomposing
          body parts.
          Michael is a bit lost.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          When they find a body the police
          want to know how long they've been
          dead. The fine department at
          Tennessee helps them. They have
          lots of body parts - arms, legs,
          hands - from hospitals and medical
          schools. Do you know where they
          store them?
          (Michael shakes his head)
          Right underneath the football
          field.
          Michael's eyes widen a bit.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          So, while it's fine and dandy to
          have 100,000 fans cheering for you,
          the bodies you should be worried
          about are right underneath the
          turf. Set to poke up through the
          ground and grab you.
          She raises a clawed hand (think "CARRIE") to make her point.
          Michael is completely freaked out by this.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          But it's your decision where you
          play football. Don't let me
          influence you.

          Coach 0, you're coming a little
          late to the party but we're diehard
          Rebels so I'm gonna give you a
          frickin' road map, okay?

                         ED ORGERON
          Yes 'm.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          LSU is out. Everybody knows
          Saban's going to the NFL. So when
          he comes for his visit to Ole Miss,
          don't take him to some titty bar
          and give him tequila shots. He'll
          have nightmares for weeks. Feed
          him Italian - he likes Fettucine
          Alfredo - take him to a movie - but
          not Chainsaw massacre because he'll
          just cover his eyes - and put him
          to bed by ten. You got it?

                         ED ORGERON
          Yes'm. What about Tennessee?

          by the stadium. And the team walks
          it before the game, surrounded by
          thousands of fans. It's a sacred
          ritual. And I'm in front.

                         SI
          ("that's it?")
          Seen it a thousand times.

                         ED ORGERON
          Ever seen it from the front of the
          line? Next year, you and me --
          leading the team.

                         SI
          Tennessee offered to let me run on
          the field and flip the coin.

                         ED ORGERON
          I'll throw in a sideline pass.
          Si considers this, smiles and nods.

          164 INT. WINGATE - LIBRARY -- DAY 164 

          A press conference is under way. Photographers push to get a
          shot of --
          Michael, at a table, stares at three caps -- Tennessee, LSU
          and Ole Miss. He smiles and selects an Ole Miss hat.

          165 INT. PHIL FULMER'S OFFICE - DAY 165

          Fulmer watches the press conference on TV. He tosses a piece
          of chalk against the wall.

          Leigh Anne and Bob have a chat in the empty classroom.

                         BOB
          I will not give a student a grade
          he, or she, doesn't deserve.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          He needs a B. What's he gonna have
          to do to "deserve" that?

                         BOB
          Right now Michael's doing C minus,
          D plus work. His best chance at
          improving is with the written essay
          at the end of the year. It counts
          for a third of his grade.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          That's it. We're sunk.

          167 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 167

          Miss Sue works with Michael at the table.

                         MISS SUE
          Why not write about "Great
          Expectations"? You're a lot like
          Pip. He was poor, an orphan and
          someone sort of found him. You
          should be able to relate to that.
          Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball.

          MISS SUE (CONT'D)
          Fine, let's go through the reading
          list. But you have to pick one,
          Michael.
          (reading from list)
          "Pygmalion"... "A Tale of Two
          Cities"... "The Charge of the
          Light Brigade"...

                         SEAN
          (almost to himself)
          "Half a league, half a league, half
          a league onward." I love that one.

          Fine, you do this and I'll watch
          basketball.
          Miss Sue walks over, takes the remote from Sean, who rises.

                         SEAN
          "All in the valley of Death rode
          the six hundred". They call LSU's
          stadium Death Valley because of
          this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson
          is writing about Ole Miss-LSU.

                         MICHAEL
          You're kidding?

                         SEAN
          No. It's a great story.

                         MISS SUE
          It's a poem.

                         SEAN
          "Forward the Light Brigade!"
          That's like the offense. "Charge
          for the guns'he said." That's the
          end zone. "Into the Valley of
          Death rode the six hundred."
          He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          "Forward the Light Brigade! Was
          there a man dÂ±smay'd? Not tho' the
          soldier knew someone had
          blundered."

                         MICHAEL
          Someone made a mistake?

                         SEAN'
          Yeah, their leader, their coach.

                         MICHAEL
          Why would they go ahead if they
          knew he messed up?

                         SEAN
          "Theirs not to make reply, theirs
          not to reason why, theirs but to do
          and die: Into the Valley of Death

          They all gonna die, aren't they?

                         SEAN
          Yeah.

                         MICHAEL
          That's really, really sad.

                         SEAN
          I think you just found something to
          write about.
          Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          Courage is a hard thing to figure.
          You can have courage based on a
          dumb idea or a mistake, but you're
          not supposed to question adults, or
          your coach, or your teacher because
          they make the rules. Maybe they
          know best but maybe they don't.

          168 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 168

          Michael moves through the tough crowd.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          It all depends on who you are,
          where you come from. Didn't at
          least one of the six hundred guys
          think about giving up and joining
          with the other side? I mean,
          Valley of Death, that's pretty
          salty stuff.

          169 EXT. WINGATE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 169 

          Michael walks under the arch for the first time.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          That's why courage is tricky.
          Should you always do what others
          tell you to do? Sometimes you
          might not even know why you're
          doing something. I mean, any fool
          can have courage.

          Michael leans against the wall and tries to sleep.

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          But honor, that's the real reason
          you either do something or you
          don't. It's who you are and maybe
          who you want to be. If you die
          trying for something important then
          you have both honor and courage and
          that's pretty good.

          171 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 171 

          Bob sits at his desk, reading Michael's. essay. As he turns
          to the last page...

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          I think that's what the writer was
          saying. That you should try for
          courage and hope for honor. And
          maybe even pray that the people
          telling you what. to do have some,
          too.
          Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles.

                         MICHAEL
          He played basketball.

                         GRANGER
          And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as
          well.

                         MICHAEL
          She was a cheerleader.

                         GRANGER
          Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is
          their favorite school?

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          Do they like any other
          Universities?

                         (MICHAEL SHRUGS)
          What about, say Tennessee?

                         MICHAEL
          They can't stand Tennessee.

                         GRANGER
          So they wouldn't be happy if you
          chose to play football there?

                         MICHAEL
          No.

                         GRANGER
          And your tutor...

           Miss Sue.

                         GRANGER
          Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to
          attend Ole Miss?

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          Did you know that the Tuohys make
          generous donations to Ole Miss?
          That even Miss Sue makes donations?
          That the:Tuohy's have a condo in
          Oxford so they can attend as many
          athletic events as possible? That,
          in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy
          are by our definition "boosters."

                         MICHAEL
          What's that mean?

                         GRANGER
          A booster is someone with an
          abnormal interest in a school's
          sports. Someone who-contributes
          financially to the University's
          athletic program.
          Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then
          comes the part we've heard before...'

                         GRANGER (CONT'D)
          Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?

                         (NO RESPONSE)

          Do you know, do you understand why
          I'm here?

          MICHAEL (V.0.)
          To... investigate.

                         GRANGER
          Yes. To investigate. I'm here to
          investigate your odd...
          predicament. Do you find it odd?
          Your predicament?

          Iono...
          she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents -
          a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in.
          She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him
          out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,
          rubs his knees some more.

                         MICHAEL (CONT'D)
          Can I... can I leave now?

                         GRANGER

                         (WITH FINALITY)
          No. You can't.
          Michael's building up anxiety by the second.

                         MICHAEL
          What do you want, ma'am?

                         GRANGER
          What I want, what my job is, is to
          discern whether something untoward
          occurred in your recruitment to Ole
          Miss.

                         MICHAEL
          Unto...

                         GRANGER
          I want the facts. I need the
          truth.

                         MICHAEL
          I didn't lie...

                         GRANGER
          And I want to know what you think
          about all this.

                         MICHAEL

          THINK ABOUT WHAT?!
          It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice.
          It echoes in the room. Granger lets it die before she leans
          forward and continues...

                         GRANGER
          The NCAA fears that with your
          recruitment a door might be opened
          that boosters from lots of schools
          in the south will become legal
          guardians for young athletes
          without means and funnel them to
          their Alma Maters.
          Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.

                         GRANGER (CONT'D)
          I'm not saying I believe it and I'm
          not saying I don't, but there are
          many people involved with this case
          who would argue that the Tuohys
          took you in, fed you, clothed you,
          paid for your private education --

                         MICHAEL
          (almost to himself)
          No...no...no...

                         GRANGER
          -- bought you a car and paid for a
          tutor all as part of a plan to
          insure that you played football for
          the University of Mississippi.
          Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long
          time then quickly stands and makes for the door.

                         GRANGER (CONT'D)
          Michael, we're not finished.
          But he's gone.

          188 EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY 188

          Leigh Anne sees Michael exit the building. Once he's outside
          he moves in circles, gesticulating and talking to himself.
          Leigh Anne races over --

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael, what's wrong?
          He looks at her, glares really; upset.

                         MICHAEL

                         MICHAEL
          All along you wanted me to go to
          Ole Miss.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Well, of course, but...

                         MICHAEL
          Why did you do this for me?!

                         LEIGH ANNE
          What?

                         MICHAEL
          Everything! Was it for you or was
          it for me? Was it so I would go to
          school where you wanted?! Was it
          so I would do what you wanted?!

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No, Michael...

          (her own words)
          Don't you dare lie to me!
          Leigh Anne digests this, takes a breath...

          Michael, look... I can see where,
          where some people might...
          Her inability, for the first time, to articulate, hits
          Michael in the face.

          I'm not stupid!
          He turns and walks away.

          I should have followed him.

                         SEAN
          You had no way of knowing he'd
          disappear.

          Was he right?
          (off Sean's look)
          What he said about us?

                         SEAN
          Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave
          clothes to a boy who had one pair
          of shorts. We gave him a bed. To
          hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again
          tomorrow.

          scholarship? A scholarship to Ole
          Miss.

                         SEAN
          He could go wherever he wanted, he
          knew that.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I
          know for sure I never did.
          Sean considers this, then beckons.

                         SEAN
          Come here, honey.
          She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her
          forehead.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Am I a good person?
          (off his look)
          Not a joke. Not rhetorical.

                         SEAN
          You're the best person I know.
          Everything you do, you do for
          others.

          I have not a clue. You obviously
          get some sick satisfaction from it.
          She looks at him. There's truth in his words.

          Michael steps inside. Alton points to a chair. A stoned out
          couple smokes on the adjacent couch.
          Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the
          other corner of the room sits David, the young man we met
          before. Michael nods and David nods back. Alton hands
          Michael a beer.

          But you know that rich kid football
          ain't like the public school
          league. People packing knives in
          their socks. Back in the day I was

          David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the
          beat is bouncing off the walls. Michael sips the beer; rubs
          his knees.

                         ALTON
          She got any other kids? She got a
          daughter?

                         (MICHAEL NODS)
          You tap that?
          Michael sets down the beer, rises to leave.

                         ALTON (CONT'D)
          Where you going? Sit down. I
          wanna hear about your fine white
          sister. 'Cause I like me some
          mommy/daughter.

                         MICHAEL
          Shut up.
          Alton steps in front of Michael, raises his hands ---

                         SWEETLITTLE --
          Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force,
          flies back against the wall. On the ground he reaches in his
          belt for his gun, but just as he gets it out --
          Michael slaps it away. He picks up Alton and throws him
          across the room. The party comes unhinged as Michael grabs
          Alton, holds him against the wall with one hand while
          pounding him with the other. Blood flies from Alton's face -
          eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds.
          TWO OTHER GUYS grab Michael from behind and one --

          STICKS A GUN IN MICHAEL'S TEMPLE
          Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles
          them over the couch. An errant round FIRES into the ceiling.
          A table flies and the crib smashes.
          Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to
          the SCREAMING child on the floor.
          He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop -
          the music, the screams, the crying. The shots PULSE to the
          music and. are INTERCUT WITH:

          Leigh Anne approaches the complex. Alton, his face bandaged,
          sits on the stoop with his crowd. A mother holds the
          unharmed baby.

                         ALTON
          He gone.
          Leigh Anne stops, looks to Alton.

                         ALTON (CONT'D)
          But you tell him I'll be seeing him
          around. You tell him he'll get his.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Michael was here?

                         ALTON
          Last night. Sneaked me then took
          off like a little bitch. So you
          tell him, sleep with one eye open.
          Yod'hear me, bitch?'
          Leigh Anne steps closer to Alton, stares him down.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          No, you hear me, bitch. You
          threaten my son you threaten me.
          You so much as cross downtown
          you'll be sorry. I'm in a prayer

          She taps her tiny purse. Alton laughs.

          What you got in there, a .22? You
          got yourself a Saturday Night
          Special?

          She turns on her heels and strides to her car.

          When she gets in she's so nervous she hyperventilates. Her
          phone RINGS and she opens the tiny purse revealing nothing
          more than a wallet and the phone. She recognizes the number
          and answers...

          You think the police gonna come and
          get me?

          202 EXT. CURB - DAY 202

          Leigh Anne sits on the curb with Michael.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          I'd imagine the last thing anybody
          at Hurt Village wants is cops
          snooping around.
          (after a beat)
          I swore I'd never ask but... how'd 
          you make it out of there, Michael? 

                         MICHAEL
          When I was little and something
          awful was happening, my Mama would
          tell me to close my eyes.

          She was tryin' to keep me from
          seeing her do drugs or other bad
          things. And she'd say, "keep 'em
          closed till I say so." And then
          when she was finished or the bad
          things were over she'd say, "now
          when I count to three, you open
          your eyes and the past is gone, the
          world is a good place, and it's all
          gonna be okay."

          You closed your eyes. 
          He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare 
          out at the street, then...

          LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)
          You know, when I was driving all
          over Kingdom Come looking for you I
          just kept thinking about one thing.

                         (BEAT)
          Ferdinand the bull. Everyone
          assumed because he was big that he
          wanted to fight in the ring. But
          he just wanted to sit under a tree
          and smell the flowers.
          (right at him)
          I know I should have asked this a
          long time ago but do you even wanna
          play football? I mean, do you even
          like it?'
          Michael considers this. 

                         MICHAEL
          I'm pretty good at it.

                         LEIGH ANNE
          Yeah, you are.

                         (A BEAT)
          Sean and I have been talking and
          Michael, if you're gonna accept a
          football scholarship we think it
          should be from Tennessee.
          (off his look)
          And I promise you I will be at
          every game cheering for you.

                         MICHAEL

          in my color wheel.

          I want you to go wherever you want.
          It's your decision, Michael. It's
          your life.

          You were pretty upset.

                         MICHAEL
          You ask a lot of questions.

                         GRANGER
          I'm trying to get to the bottom of
          this.

                         MICHAEL
          But all the questions you asked
          were about why everybody else
          wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

          You asked about everybody but me.
          You never asked why I wanted to go

          Alright, fine, Michael... why do
          you want to go to Ole Miss?

          It's where my family goes to
          school. It's where they've always
          gone to school.

          A newspaper photo of a dead boy from the.projects. Then
          another headline, another young, black face. Another and
          another, until the last headline shows a photo of David,
          Alton's minion - his face full of shining promise.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          In the last paragraph they talked
          about his superb athletic skills
          and how different his life might
          have been if he hadn't fallen
          behind and dropped out of school.
          He was twenty-one years old the day
          he died. It was his birthday.

          the other Michael/crowd shots with one difference - this time
          he moves at the same speed as everyone else.

          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE
          But it wasn't. And I suppose I
          have God to thank for that. God

THE BODYGUARD

   Clean Shooting Draft

       February 1992




  FOR EDUCATIONAL
   PURPOSES ONLY

    SCREEN IS BLACK
    In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing
    approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of
    a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies.
    THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from
    another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish-
    able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete
    walls and dies away. Silence.
    SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:

1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1

    FRANK FARMER'S FACE -
    mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He
    is The Bodyguard.
    ANGLE - HIT MAN
    dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops
    heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly
    down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face
    down on the  cement floor.
    A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of
    KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the
    filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome,
    50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear
    as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There
    is no movement.
    The two men are lying near the right front fender of a
    black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit
    man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself
    up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still
    alert for any further threat.
    MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
    A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.   Farmer wheels, snub-
    nosed .357 aimed at them.
                            FRANK
               Freeze!
    ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE
    A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.   Farmer
    lowers his weapon and speaks.
                            FRANK
                      (calm, but an order)
               Call 911.

                                                                     2.


     CAMERA has CRANED UP TO a high, almost-frozen WIDE SHOT of
     the scene. It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness.

2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2

     Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom.
     Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all
     the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering
     image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman
     as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the
     image until it is almost broken up into its scanning
     lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her
     song "I have Nothing."


2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A
     A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile
     of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of
     magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control,
     softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw
     in the store window, the same song.
     Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove
     a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the
     gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound.
     The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars.
     They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A
     headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST
     TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they
     excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the
     care of a surgeon.

3    EXT. HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT                            3
     A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms
     stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones
     are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel!
     Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way,
     Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of
     this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive,
     well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other
     celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside
     by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm
     and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.

5    INT. KLINGMAN'S OFFICE DEN - NIGHT                         5
     In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint-
     ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur,
     he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer.

                                                                   3.

                          KLINGMAN
             Your hands ever shake, Frank?
                           FRANK
             Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline.
                          KLINGMAN
             ... How did you know?
                          FRANK
             I saw him washing the car.
                          KLINGMAN
             I saw him.
                          FRANK
             They don't wash cars on the
             parking levels.
    He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it.
                          KLINGMAN
             You know, I'd like you to stay on.
    He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank.
                          FRANK
             I'm not good in permanent
             positions, my feet go to sleep.
    The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses
    in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't.

6   INT. DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT                      6
    The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word "TIME" onto
    a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom
    note. Each word has been cut from a different page and
    is in a different typeface. The note is being assembled
    with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance
    and is quite easy to read. It reads:
             MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
             I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME TO DIE IS ...

7   EXT. CHARITY CONCERT - EVENING                             7
    A blur of hands and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper,
    autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA.
    Again, a mass chanting "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!"
    Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered
    items.
    In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing "Best wishes,

                                                                     4.

     Rachel Marron" on an out-stretched open palm. In the
     midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be-
     ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend
     "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."

8    EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - EVENING                        8

     SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two
     suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a
     small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-
     cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass.
     Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a
     few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A
     curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the
     door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail
     inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go
     inside. The door shuts.

10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10
     Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table
     in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a
     glass beside it.
     At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and
     reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He
     lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat.
     At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently
     eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on
     the plate and eats from it directly while glancing
     through the magazine.

11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11
     Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room.
     There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack-
     ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the
     mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll
     with its embroidered ribbon message "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."
     Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers
     resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is
     an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging
     applause, bowing.
     The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the
     LIGHT BULBS.
     The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and
     CONFUSION.
     TITLES END.

                                                                      5.


12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12
     Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun-
     glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of
     "DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor
     RADIO.

     An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
     and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives
     lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of
     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.
     BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black
     gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a
     conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well.
     He's Rachel's personal manager.
                           DEVANEY
              So, you won't protect Rachel Marron
              just because she's in show business?
                           FRANK
              I don't do celebrities.
                           DEVANEY
              But the biggest money's in show
              business people.
     Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun-
     glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives.
     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It
     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the
     fence.
     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his
     eyes again.
                           DEVANEY
                     (picking up another
                      knife)
              Do you really do these things?
                           FRANK
              Isn't she the one who collects
              dolls?
     This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.
                           DEVANEY
                     (exasperated)
              Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the
              most famous people in America. She's
              won every music award invented. She's
              got the number one song in the country
              right now and she'll probably be
              nominated for an Oscar in her very

                                                           6.

         first picture. And you want to know
         'Isn't she the one...?' Christ,
         man, where've you been?
                      FRANK
         You mean she doesn't collect dolls?

                        DEVANEY
                  (defeated)
         Yes.    She collects dolls.
                      FRANK
         I thought I knew who she was.
Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or
not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with
a knife.
                      DEVANEY
         You're probably deadly with these
         things, aren't you?
                       FRANK
         Deadly.
                       DEVANEY
         Show me.
Frank doesn't move.
                      DEVANEY
         Why are you resisting this job?
         $2,000 bucks a week.
                (no response)
         $2,500.
                      FRANK
         There are several good men
         available for that kind of money.
         Have you talked to Fitzgerald or
         Racine? Portman?
                       DEVANEY
         Yeah.   Portman was interested...
He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what
he takes to be the first serious talk.
                      DEVANEY
         ... but we're told you're the best.
                      FRANK
         There's no such thing.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, we're talking about a
         very frightened lady. With a

                                                                 7.

         seven-year old son. Believe me,
         I wouldn't be here if I didn't
         think this was for real.
                (long pause)
         Farmer, she begged me to get you.
Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time.
He picks up five throwing knives and stands up.
                      FRANK
         All right. I'll come and I'll look
         the situation over. If I take it,
         it's three thousand a week.
                      DEVANEY
                (whistles)
         Okay. You must be very deadly
         for three grand a week.
Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.     He
throws one of the knives. It misses the post and
clatters against the fence.
                        FRANK
         Shit.
Devaney's face drops.   Frank examines the next knife.
                      FRANK
                (mumbling)
         I know it's something like...
The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from
Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind
Frank.
                        FRANK
         Sorry.
Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and
motions Devaney off to the side.
                      FRANK
         Better not stand right behind me.
Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go
with one smooth motion.
The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.     THUMP.
Frank's hand arching again.     Throwing the remaining knives.
Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical
line with the first one.

                                                                     8.

13   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY          13
     Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street
     from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron
     driveway.
     FRANK'S POV

     as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation
     and the rising grounds beyond.
     (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be
     taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re-
     presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in
     the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant
     vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and
     his burden. The audience must be put in the position of
     looking, searching, scanning with him.)
     He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick-
     ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a
     black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives
     rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches
     it go.
     Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He
     grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate
     rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button
     on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S
     VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.
                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              Yes?
                           FRANK
              Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.
                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              What?
                           FRANK
              Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss
              Marron!
                           MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                     (obviously has not heard)
              Have you got an appointment?
                           FRANK
              The atomic number of zinc is 30.
                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              All right.
     There is a LOUD BUZZING and the gate swings arthritically
     open.

                                                                     9.


14   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                        14
     FRANK'S POV
     as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land-
     scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places. The
     mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind
     the mansion fall away.

15   EXT. MANSION - CIRCULAR DRIVE/ENTRANCE AREA - DAY          15
     The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives
     PAST the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is
     polishing the mascot on the limousine. One of his arms
     is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth
     and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.
     Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is
     parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it.
                           HENRY
              Can I help you?
                           FRANK
              Are you the man on the intercom?
                            HENRY
              No.   Can I help you?
                           FRANK
              My name is Edison. I have an
              appointment with Miss Marron.
                            HENRY
              Oh.   And that was arranged by...?
                           FRANK
                     (impressed)
              Mr. Devaney.
                           HENRY
              Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.
                           FRANK
              What happened to your arm?
                           HENRY
                     (looking at his arm)
              A doll.
     He goes back to the limousine.
     Frank RINGS the DOORBELL, although the door is not shut.
     EMMA, a fiftyish housekeeper, appears. A man in cover-
     alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber.

                                                                     10.

                           FRANK
              Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.
                           EMMA
              Come in, please.


16   INT. MARRON MANSION - DAY                                  16
     Frank steps into the foyer with Emma. She is a warm,
     matronly woman who does a fine job running the house
     without standing on custom.
                           EMMA
              I'll tell you quite honestly,
              Mr. Ford, I don't know where
              Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he'd
              be here?
                           FRANK
              Yes.
                           EMMA
              Then he probably is.   Let me look.
     She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There
     are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being
     repainted. On a number of TV screens scattered around,
     Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening
     titles) is continuously playing. The sound of the song
     itself -- "I HAVE NOTHING" -- comes softly from concealed
     speakers.
                            EMMA
               Please make yourself at home. Can
               I get you anything?
     Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer.
     Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in
     the opposite direction. It's obviously undergoing a
     major redecoration. Painters, decorators and designers
     come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence.

17   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY                  17
     The deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and
     more lived-in rooms appear.

18   INT. MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY                       18
     Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool
     area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are
     shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career:
     A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records,
     other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo-
     graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and

                                                                     11.

     her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are
     goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank
     looks down at the pool.
     FRANK'S POV
     Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven-
     year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph,
     dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of
     the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long
     speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny
     sits, some way off, embroidering.
     Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL
     BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another
     Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy.
     Frank follows the sound.

19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19
     Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is
     coming from.
     It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a
     bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It
     is packed with people, props and video equipment. There
     is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized
     chaos. MUSIC BLARES out.
     A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance
     number for a music video, directed by their choreographer
     RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the
     glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman
     circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a
     large-screen TV behind them.
     In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a
     proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand-
     ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All
     the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't
     immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among
     the big cushions.
     As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel
     chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and
     makes his way over to him.
     On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his
     late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch
     neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right.
     The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down.
     Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins.
     Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being
     used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through
     the rehearsal.

                                                              12.


In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties
(NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting.
She glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next
to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at
the other end of the line.

The music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold
their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again.
APPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest.
Then LAUGHTER.
From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO
DIRECTOR.

                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)
         Playback, everybody!
Rachel's voice comes from the sofa.
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Come here, Rory!
The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from
sight. Sound of kissing, laughter.
The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather
round it expectantly.
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Sugar, that's gonna be great.    I
         love the ending...
Devaney moves to the front of the room. The PLAYBACK
STARTS behind him. There are several overlapping
conversations going on.
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel...
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Nicki, how'd you like the number?
         You like the end routine?
                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)
         Rachel. You wanna see it back
         from the beginning or just the
         ending...
NICKI, responds to Rachel's question.
                      NICKI
         It was just great, Rory...
But Rachel is already replying to the video director.

                                                               13.

                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         I wanna see it all. Tony?      I'll
         bet Tony loved it.
The brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank
as he speaks.

                       TONY
         Ehh!
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Don't worry, Rory. Tony doesn't
         appreciate great art.
The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's
approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side.

                      DRESS DESIGNER
                (showing the costume)
         What do you think, Rachel?
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, Frank Farmer is...
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Devaney, do you think this is me?
                      DEVANEY
                (not looking)
         It's terrific...
Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel.
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, Frank Farmer is here.
Devaney nods in Frank's direction.     Nicki looks at Frank.
                       RACHEL (O.S.)
         Who's here?
                      DEVANEY
         Frank Farmer.
                (getting no response)
         The bodyguard.
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         I think Rory should be my
         bodyguard.
                (to dress designer)
         Let's see the back again...
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, raise your butt out of
         there and meet this man.
RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa.     It's a bit of

                                                             14.

a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old.
A young woman. Not beautiful, not ugly. Unique only in
that she is immediately interesting. A Superstar.
                      RACHEL
         Well, I'm up.

Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other.
Frank comes forward.
                      DEVANEY
         Frank Farmer, Rachel Marron.
Rachel offers her hand and they shake.    Rachel looks him
up and down.

                      RACHEL
         You don't look like a bodyguard.
                      FRANK
         What did you expect?
                      RACHEL
         I don't know. Tough guy maybe.
                      FRANK
         This is my disguise.
                      RACHEL
                (smiling)
         Well, his timing's good.
                      DEVANEY
         This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
         and personal secretary.
                      NICKI
         Nice to meet you, Mr. Farmer.
                      DEVANEY
                (indicating)
         ... Tony Scibelli.
Tony nods but makes no move to shake hands.
Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer.
                      RACHEL
                (to designer)
         The back's still not right...
SPECTOR, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave.
                      DEVANEY
         ... Sy Spector, Rachel's publicist.

                                                              15.

                      RACHEL
         Can we get you a drink?
                      FRANK
         Orange juice.
                       RACHEL
         Straight?   Nicki.
Nicki goes to the bar. Rachel sits and motions for
Frank to sit opposite her.
                      RACHEL
         Rory, I'll be with you in a second.
Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big
screen video.
                      RACHEL
         Listen, this whole thing is Bill's
         idea... This sudden obsession with
         protecting me. Tony has always
         handled my security and we've done
         just fine.
                      SPECTOR (O.S.)
                (into the phone)
         Yes, I'll hold but not long...
                      RORY (O.S.)
         Rachel, you want to run through
         your steps before we go again...?
                      RACHEL
         I'll be with you in a second.
Nicki hands Frank his orange juice.   She looks at Frank as
she speaks.
                      NICKI
         I think Bill's right, Rachel. It's
         time you took more precautions.
Spector enters the conversation.
                      SPECTOR
                (one hand covers
                 the phone)
         Nicki, I'm sure Mr. Farmer would
         tell you the number of nuts
         writing fan letters jumps every
         time Rachel is on the cover of
         a magazine.
                      DEVANEY
         Not like this.

                                                             16.

An ASSISTANT hands Rachel a small sheaf of phone messages,
some papers for signature and a pen. Rachel checks
through them and signs as she talks.
                      RACHEL
         Relax guys, I said I'd do  it. You
         see what I'm dealing with  here?
         I'm willing to go along,  as long
         as we all understand each  other.
         I'm not going to let this  alter
         my life one little bit.
                (to assistant)
         Who was this?
                      ASSISTANT
                (overlapping Devaney)
         Oh. That was Clive's office.
         They called three times...
                      DEVANEY
         Honey, that's not going to be a
         problem.
                      DEVANEY (CONT'D)
                (to Frank)
         Rachel runs a very informal
         household, we're all on a first
         name basis...
Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in.
                      SPECTOR
         ...And I'm sure you'll blend in
         just fine. You can select whatever
         alarm systems you want for the
         house. Some kind of improved
         security for the gate. What else,
         Rachel?
Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and
the dancers.
Frank looks at Devaney.   Devaney doesn't like the tone
this is taking.
                      RACHEL
         I think I'm safe when I'm here at
         the house so I guess the main thing
         will be when I go out. Tony will
         be able to fill you in on all that.
         You two will have to work something
         out. I don't want both of you
         falling all over me everywhere I
         go. The most important thing is
         this -- I will not allow Fletcher
         to be affected by this thing...

                                                              17.

Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her,
starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion.
                      SPECTOR
                (punching phone)
         I was just going to cover that.
         We'll have to tell the child you
         have some other function...
                      RACHEL
         I don't want him to think   he's in
         prison. So the house and    grounds
         must not be altered in any   way.
         He shouldn't be aware that   you're
         here. Is that clear?

Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney
once.
                      FRANK
         Miss Marron...
                      RACHEL
         Rachel.
                      FRANK
         There's been a mistake. A
         misunderstanding. If you'll show
         me the quickest way out, we'll
         save each other a lot of trouble.
Frank's on his way. Someone brings a silver headpiece on
a stand to Rachel. She ignores it, still looking at Frank.
                      TONY
         You can go past the pool.
                      DEVANEY
         Shut up, Tony.
                      FARMER
         Nice meeting you.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, will you wait a minute?
                      SPECTOR
         Bill, I don't think we should be
         begging this guy for his services.
                      DEVANEY
         Sy, I'm handling this.
Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, will you wait a minute?

                                                                      18.



20   EXT. MARRON GROUNDS - BACK LAWN - DAY                       20
     Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down
     the slope. Devaney is scurrying to keep up.

                           DEVANEY
              Farmer, will you wait a minute? I
              should have told you more. I'm
              sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't
              go through with it. I thought I'd
              let the two of you work it out...
              come to an understanding.
                            FRANK
              We did.
     Frank starts to walk off.   Devaney is grasping at straws.
                           DEVANEY
              She's not a bad person, and whether
              she knows it or not, she needs you.
                     (a beat)
              You've come this far... Would you
              just wait here for one minute. I
              want to show you something. Please,
              Farmer.
     Devaney runs back to the house.

21   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                        21
     Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to,  walks up to
     Frank with his remote-control speed boat.   Frank would
     like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his  way. Frank
     looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown  figure. The
     watching nanny continues her embroidering,  some way off.
                            FLETCHER
              Hi!
                           FRANK
                     (continuing to walk)
              Hi.
                           FLETCHER
              How are you today?
                           FRANK
                     (wants to keep walking)
              All right. How 'bout yourself?
                           FLETCHER
              Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?

                                                             19.

Frank gives up.    He's not going to get out of here.   He
stops.
                         FRANK
         No.     I don't like boats.
                         FLETCHER
         You don't!     Why not?
                      FRANK
         Oh, I don't know.
                      FLETCHER
         Sure you do, but you don't want
         to tell me.

Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat.
He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher.
                      FRANK
         You're a smart kid.
Fletcher nods.
                      FRANK
         I'll tell you. One time I was
         stuck on a boat with some people
         for four months.
                        FLETCHER
         A lifeboat?
                      FRANK
         Nope. A big white yacht.      Do you
         know what a yacht is?
                         FLETCHER
                   (thinks about this)
         Yeah.     My mom rented this huge
         yacht    once, and we took a trip.
         It was    great. Everyone threw up
         except    me. I love 'em.
                      FRANK
                (standing to leave)
         Well, nobody's perfect.
Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes.
                      FLETCHER
         You're the bodyguard, aren't you?
Frank is surprised.
                      FRANK
         What do you know about it?

                                                                     20.

                           FLETCHER
              I've got ears.
                           FRANK
              I'll remember that.
     Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is
     holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he
     holds the file casually at his side.
     Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.
                           DEVANEY
              How are you, Fletch?
                     (to Frank)
              I'm glad you waited.    Let's go
              over here.
                           FRANK
                     (to Fletcher)
              Nice meeting you.
     Fletcher looks after them silently.

22   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                           22
     Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open-
     ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition.
     Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to
     Fletcher, who has started his boat again.
                           DEVANEY
              This is just in the last six months.
                           FRANK
                     (looks at the pile)
              Have you ever tried having these
              professionally assessed?
     Devaney shakes his head no.
     Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by
     the corner of the page. From many different sources, some
     are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts.
     Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally,
     one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it.
     Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand
     over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles
     of letters.
                           SPECTOR
              Devaney says you were in the Secret
              Service.
     Frank nods.

                                                            21.


Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he
removes from the stack and places in the center of the
table.
                      SPECTOR
         Ever guard the main man?
                      FRANK
         I was two years with Carter and
         four years with Reagan.
Frank sets another letter in the center pile.   He stops,
smiling at it.

                      FRANK
         This is a little old lady in
         Akron. She's written to
         everybody I've ever worked for.
He continues to turn until something stops him. Several
letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted-
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.
                      SPECTOR
         Reagan got shot.
His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.
                      FRANK
         Not on my shift.
Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.
                        SPECTOR
         That's good.
Frank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in
the center of the table.
                      FRANK
         At first glance, these don't
         bother me. But keep them. You
         never know.
He separates one letter from the others.
                      FRANK
         This could be something.
Devaney searches Frank's face.
                      DEVANEY
         You think it could be the same
         guy? The one who rigged the doll?

                                                                      22.

                           FRANK
              I don't know. Did you tell Miss
              Marron about it? Does she know
              about the doll?
     Devaney and Spector exchange looks.   This is evidently a
     sore point between them.

                           SPECTOR
              We said there'd been some electrical
              problem while she was on stage.
              Short circuit. Look, she doesn't
              need that kind of worry right now.
              It would upset her.
                           FRANK
              What about the police?
                           SPECTOR
              There was no reason for the police.
              No one got hurt.
                           FRANK
              What about the chauffeur?
                           SPECTOR
              It was nothing. It was just our
              people there.
     Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.   Devaney's
     eyes are still on Frank's face.
                           DEVANEY
              Sy, I think we should show him
              the room.

23   INT. ROOM - DAY                                             23
     Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room. He
     glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the
     kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from
     the pages of a tabloid layout.
                           FRANK
              Is this her bedroom?
                           SPECTOR
              Yes.
                           DEVANEY
              No. She sleeps in a room next to
              Fletcher's down the hall. Sy had
              this done for a magazine layout,
                           SPECTOR
              'Superstars in their Boudoirs.'

                                                     23.

         Did you see it?
                      FRANK
         No.
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel never liked it.

                      SPECTOR
         She didn't have to like it...
Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed.
                      DEVANEY
         We found the letter here.

                      FRANK
         Somebody was in here?
                      DEVANEY
         Somebody broke in and ...
         masturbated on the bed.
                      FRANK
         And she doesn't know about this
         either?
Devaney shakes his head.
                      SPECTOR
         Are you kidding? This would really
         freak her out.
                      DEVANEY
         What do you think?
                      FRANK
         Someone penetrates the house, gets
         upstairs and jerks off on the bed
         ... I'd say that qualifies as a
         problem.
                      DEVANEY
         What kind of problem?
                      SPECTOR
                (agitated)
         Of fuck, we don't need this now...
                      FRANK
         This house is wide open.
                      SPECTOR
         Excuse me?
                      FRANK
         I said this house is wide open

                                                                     24.

              and you people have no clue what
              real security is or what it takes
              to achieve it.
                           DEVANEY
                     (does a quick read
                      on Frank)
              Frank, I totally respect what
              you're telling me. Tell me how
              you want to work and I'll
              accommodate you.
                           FRANK
              Look, I can't protect her. I won't
              be responsible for her safety if
              she doesn't know what's going on.

                           DEVANEY
              I'll talk to her, I'll make her
              understand. I can do that.
                            SPECTOR
              No.   I'll talk to her.
     Spector exits the room in a huff.

24   EXT. MARRON HOUSE FRONT - DAY                              24
     Frank emerges with Devaney and crosses toward his car.
                           DEVANEY
              ...She won't give you any static,
              Frank, you've got my word on that.
     Frank is still focused on Fletcher.
                           FRANK
              Sure she will.
                           DEVANEY
              So what job's perfect? You're
              a bodyguard, aren't you?
     Slowly, Frank faces him.
                            FRANK
                      (quietly)
              Yeah.
     As they reach the car, Devaney is relieved.   He dares a
     perfect smile.
                           FRANK
              Devaney, if you ever lie to me
              again, I'll take you apart.

                                                                     25.


25   INT. MARRON MANSION - FRANK'S ROOM - DAY                   25
     Henry Dupres is leaning against the doorjamb. The room
     is comfortable, a guest bedroom. Frank flops one
     battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it. He pulls
     open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away
     his clothes.
                           HENRY
              Why'd you say your name was
              Edison?
                           FRANK
              I wanted to see how hard it
              was to get in.

                           HENRY
              And it wasn't, was it?
     Henry unconsciously flexes his fingers, easing the muscles
     in his hands. Frank notices and pulls out a small tube of
     ointment from a pouch he's unpacking. He hands it to Henry.
                           FRANK
              Put this on your arm.    It'll help
              the ache.
     Henry takes it but is noncommittal.
                           FRANK
              I'll bet you can fill up a whole
              day just washing the cars and
              driving Rachel Marron around town.
                           HENRY
              That's my job.
                           FRANK
              We're adding to your duties.
                           HENRY
              Huh?
                           FRANK
              You're my new assistant.
     Frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase
     and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as Henry
     watches.
                           HENRY
              Says who?
                           FRANK
              Henry, I've spent a lot of time
              guarding people all over the world

                                                                   26.

              and I've found one thing to be
              true. No matter how incompetent
              the assassins, no matter how much
              they miss their target by, there's
              one person who always gets hit.
                           HENRY
              Who?
                           FRANK
              The cocky black chauffeur.
     Henry considers this for a moment and smiles.
     OVER scenes 26-28, we hear the VOICE of CNN's MARTIN
     GROVE from "Showbiz Today."

                           MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)
              It's Oscar time again, folks, and
              with Academy members marking their
              ballots today for this year's
              nominations; some canny tipsters in
              Vegas have announced their picks
              for the Awards.
                           MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              Echoing the prevailing buzz in
              Hollywood, the Vegas Hilton is
              gambling on one sure thing at
              least. Newcomer Rachel Marron
              is tipped at 3 to 1 to lead this
              year's Best Actress runners.
                           MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              The sultry singer made a notable
              acting debut last fall in Queen
              Of The Night, singing the hit song
              'I Have Nothing'. The lady may
              end up eating her words if she
              takes home that statuette March
              20th...

26   EXT. PERIMETER OF ESTATE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY           26
     The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and
     Henry walk the grounds. Frank talks and points, Henry
     takes notes on a pad. Frank gestures at the stonework
     of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along
     Waverly Lane. At the tall hedges which separate the
     estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in
     the entire length of the hedged border. Henry stops
     in amazement. Frank keeps walking.

27   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY                     27

                                                                     27.

     Fletcher stands at the edge of the terrace, staring down
     across the rear grounds.
     FLETCHER'S POV
     Frank and Henry are down there conferring about the
     fence.

     RACHEL
     appears beside Fletcher, looks down there too, then leads
     her son purposefully away. Fletcher isn't happy about it.

28   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                  28

     Frank tours the house with Emma and Henry. Frank opens
     various doors, fidgets with locking mechanisms. Emma
     finds it all exciting.

29   INT. MARRON ESTATE - POOL HOUSE/BALLET STUDIO - DAY        29
     A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted
     with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO
     plays exercising MUSIC.
     Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch-
     ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki
     waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays
     in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog
     never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes
     the door open. Frank looks the room over.
                           FRANK
              Unusual tactic for a guard dog,
              but effective.
     Nicki smiles, gesturing him in.
                           NICKI
              You can look around if you like.
     Frank indicates it won't be necessary.   Nicki stops
     working out.
                           FRANK
              I'm sorry to disturb you.
                           NICKI
              That's all right. It's an excuse
              to rest. It's my private place.
              I'm the only one who works out
              around here.
     Frank glances at photos on one wall. Most are of Nicki
     from years ago; some show her performing with a band.

                                                                     28.


                           NICKI
              My own ego wall. No platinum
              records.
     Frank spots a picture of two girls.

                           FRANK
              You and Rachel?
                           NICKI
              When I was a kid, I put a little
              band together. We played high
              school dances, stuff like that.
              Then Rachel joined the act. As
              you can imagine, she was quite a
              little entertainer. Even then,
              she had a way of stopping the show.
              So I kind of quit. Professionally,
              anyway.
                           FRANK
              You never went back?
                           NICKI
              It was pretty obvious who the
              star in our family was.
     Frank looks back at the picture.    Nicki smiles.

30   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GARAGE AREA - DAY                     30
     Frank and Henry walk toward the closed garages.
                           HENRY
              That depends on what you call a
              'hint.'
                           FRANK
              I don't want anyone on the street
              to be able to look at the cars and
              know who owns them.
     Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch. The
     three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence.
                           HENRY
              I don't think there's anything
              here you'd call a 'hint.'
     One at a time the doors go up to reveal:
     First garage -- the Cadillac limousine we've seen earlier.
     License: RACHEL 2
     Second garage -- a gray Mercedes.    License:   RACHEL 3

                                                                     29.


     Third garage -- a Jaguar XKE in an outrageous pink. No
     other car in the world is this color. License: RACHEL 1
     Frank looks at Henry, who is laughing and shakes his head.
     He walks toward the Jag.

     Frank releases the hood. He looks inside for a moment,
     then reaches into the guts of the engine. He fiddles for
     a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the
     hood shut again. He gestures toward the other two cars.
                           FRANK
              Get new plates for those two.


31   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       31
     The fortification continues as workmen use a bulldozer to
     clear away the stonework around the entrance.

32   EXT. DRIVEWAY OF MARRON ESTATE - DAY                       32
     Sitting beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the
     limo in a 180 degree 'skid turn,' sending up clouds of
     dust. A group of roadies watching bursts into spontan-
     eous applause.

33   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       33
     Fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house,
     watching the activity with delighted interest.
     He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge.
     FLETCHER'S POV
     Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone fence. Across the
     road, a black Toyota 4 X 4 is stopped. It slowly pulls
     away. We can't see inside it.

34   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       34
     One worker pries a small boulder out of a hole with a
     crowbar. His partner picks up the rock and tosses it
     on a small pile of rocks. The boulder bounces down the
     backside of the pile.

35   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                35
     Rachel, looking out her window at Fletcher and the work-
     men, sees the rock stop a yard from him. Fletcher
     scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from a

                                                                     30.

     wave on a beach.   The sight disturbs Rachel.
                             RACHEL
              Fletcher!    C'mon. Back in here!
     As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a
     window shutter. It descends in front of Rachel's face.
     She is not amused. Fletcher passes Frank on his way to
     join Rachel. He mutters almost under his breath.
                           FLETCHER
              I think he's got a black 4 X 4. Could
              be a Chevy. More like a Toyota.
     Frank stares at Fletcher, then looks back to the street.


36   INT. F.B.I. LOS ANGELES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY     36
     The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image
     onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life.
     We hear voices. One is Frank's; the other two belong
     to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY MINELLA.
     The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being
     assembled earlier. It reads:
              MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
              I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME IS COMING
              WHEN YOU SHALL DIE...
     Reading as fast as possible, we pick up some vicious
     threats and obscenities, but we don't have time to read
     it all before we...
                                                CUT TO:
     FRANK'S FACE
     illuminated by the screen.
                              COURT (O.S.)
              This    is another of the ones we
              think    are worth pursuing. Lots of
              work    went into it. No prints.
              We're    doing lab work on it. It
              could    be nothing.
     MINELLA'S FACE
     is illuminated above the projector.
                           MINELLA
              This is the one you think is tied
              to the doll?
                           FRANK (O.S.)
              That's what her manager thinks.

                                                                     31.


                           COURT (O.S.)
              This 'I Have Nothing' business is
              a natural with the record and
              movie and all.
     The projector light goes off and the room light goes on.
     The room is practically bare.
     Ray Court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil
     servant, raises the window shade. Sunlight streams
     in. On Court's lapel is a tiny P.T. Boat pin.
     Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank
     a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up.

                           COURT
              I sort of lost track of you after
              Washington.
                             FRANK
              Yeah.
                           COURT
              How's the private stuff?
                             FRANK
                       (noncommittal)
              Fine.
                           COURT
              Big money, I bet? Huh?
     Frank shrugs.    Court looks at Minella knowingly.

37   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY                                37
     Minella and Court walk Frank to the lobby.
                           COURT
              Shit. I knew it. It is big money.
              Fuck! You need an assistant? I'm
              ready to get out. I've lost my
              tolerance for assholic behavior.
              You should see the jerk we're
              covering now...
                           COURT
              'Hellfire Henry' Kent...
                             MINELLA
              Shh!    Somebody wants to pop him...
                           COURT
              Which isn't exactly surprising,
              considering what the shithead's

                                                                     32.

              been saying.
                           MINELLA
              Yeah!  Do everyone a favor...
                     (he coughs,
                      ironically)
              As you know, we're nonpolitical
              these days.
     The three men laugh easily together.   They have reached
     the lobby doors.
                           COURT
                     (to Frank)
              We'll put this stuff through
              Washington. Behavioral Sciences
              should have something in a few days.
                           FRANK
              Thanks.
                     (a pause)
              Ray?
                             COURT
              Yeah?
                           FRANK
              Why am I getting all this
              cooperation?
                           MINELLA
              She's a big star. Important
              people care about her.
                           COURT
              Politics and show business are
              practically the same these days...
              Got any crowd photos we can use?
                           FRANK
              I'm trying to keep her away from
              crowds.
                             COURT
              Good luck.

38   INT. THE IVY - DAY                                         38
     It's busy. Lots of customers arriving, leaving and
     seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross the terrace. Near
     the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged
     WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says
     something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank.
     Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both
     laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance.

                                                                    33.

                           WOMAN
                     (an afterthought;
                      phony)
              Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you.
     Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close
     without seeming to walk with Rachel.

     A little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel.
     Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then
     she signs an autograph for the girl. The girl's mother,
     close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki
     to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with
     Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply.
     Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance
     together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around.
     Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him.
                           RACHEL
              I'm surprised you didn't plug them.

39   EXT. THE IVY - DAY                                        39
     Rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby. As
     they reach the limousine, Frank continues scanning the
     street. Tony stares at him, uncomprehending.
                           TONY
                     (impatiently)
              Hey, let's go.
     Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat
     next to Tony.
                           FRANK
                     (across Tony)
              O.K. Henry, let's go.
     Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing.
     From across the street, we see the limo pull away. As
     the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle
     appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the
     camera.

40   INT. FRONT SEAT OF LIMO - DAY                             40
     Frank sits beside Tony, next to the door.   Tony speaks
     to him in a near whisper.
                           TONY
              Let me set you straight on a few
              things. For starters, I love this
              lady... What I do for her I do for

                                                           34.

         love. I'm not some hired fuckin'
         gun who is out to make her life
         miserable.
While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror;
his gaze never leaves it.

FRANK'S POV - BLACK TOYOTA
appears in the rearview mirror.
BACK TO SCENE
                      TONY
         I do things the way she likes.
         Her happiness is everything to me.

Frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror.
                      FRANK
         No problem. I'd like to know how
         you handle things, Tony.
                      TONY
         I handle things fine, Frank. You
         watch me and you'll learn something.
                      FRANK
                (to Henry)
         Turn left.
                        HENRY
         Is that him?
Frank shakes his head, he's not sure.   Tony reacts.
                      TONY
         Hey, what's going on?
                        FRANK
         Shortcut.
FRANK'S POV - TOYOTA IN REARVIEW MIRROR
As the limo turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn.
ANGLE - FRANK
whispers to Henry.
                      FRANK
         Slow down, very slow.
                      HENRY
         You want me to do a one-eighty?

                                                                    35.

                           FRANK
              No, just slow down.
     The car slows.
     ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACK

     They look up from some papers.
                           SPECTOR
              Why are we stopping?    Are we here?
     Behind them, THROUGH the rear window, the 4 X 4 can be
     seen. Sensing something, it makes a sudden TIRE-
     SCREECHING left turn, disappearing behind them.


41   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  41
     The limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a
     large fence.

42   INT. LIMO - DAY                                           42
     Frank speaks to Henry.
                           FRANK
              Stop here... Take them to the
              house.
     Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn
     and work area.
     ANGLE - TONY, RACHEL AND SPECTOR
     As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across
     the property.
                           TONY
              What's with him?

43   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  43
     As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a
     glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to
     accelerate.
     As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license
     number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end
     of the property.
     Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation.
     CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a
     steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can
     be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.

                                                                    36.


     A retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road
     to the slope. Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath,
     Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road. The
     4 X 4 ROARS PAST just   missing him and turns a corner.
     Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of
     the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs
     into a crouched upright position.
     But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.

44   INT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  44
     The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws,
     install electrical  wiring, test alarms. As Frank watches
     over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a SURV
     KIT communications  system.
                           FRANK
              Keep this loose.
     Fletcher comes to take a look too.   He peers up at Frank,
     expectantly.
                           FLETCHER
              Tell me about the car?
                              FRANK
              Toyota.     Black.
                           FLETCHER
              Four wheel drive? Late model?
     Frank nods.   Fletcher looks pleased.
                           FRANK
              One snag though.
     Fletcher's face falls.
                              FLETCHER
              What?
                           FRANK
              360,000 of them in Los Angeles.    I
              checked. Nice work, though.
                           FLETCHER
                     (shrugging)
              Well, nobody's perfect, Frank.
              Are they?
                     (gesturing to the
                      SURV KIT)
              Can I try that?

                                                                     37.


45   EXT. MARRON ESTATE POOLSIDE - DAY                          45
     Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the
     hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where
     she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a
     Walkman.

     There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from
     the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells
     toward the house.
                           RACHEL
              Shut up you assholes!


46   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                46
     A mild-looking OLD LOCKSMITH is working on Rachel's
     window. Rachel walks in from the pool, starting to
     peel off the swimsuit. She stops, startled, as she sees
     him. This is the last straw. She blows up.
                           RACHEL
                     (clutching the
                      swimsuit)
              You! You! Out! Out!        Now!   Out
              of here! Get out!
     Terrified, the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins
     backing out of the room.
                           OLD LOCKSMITH
              Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'm a real
              fan of yours, Miss Marron.
     Still angry, but disarmed, Rachel makes a face.
                           RACHEL
              Then you can take your tools with you.
     She turns to the window, in what she imagines is
     Frank's general direction, and, like a little girl,
     suddenly sticks out her tongue.

47   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GATE/GUARD HOUSE - DAY                47
     In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen, we see
     Devaney's immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it
     roars up the drive. Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in
     the newly-erected guard house. The area is greatly
     changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive
     array of switches, lights and phones at his command.
     There are several TV screens; one of them shows a series
     of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of

                                                                     38.

     the grounds. On the other, the Mercedes kicks up dust
     from the last few curves in the drive. Fletcher shakes
     his head. He's seen it all before.
                           HENRY
              Is that Devaney?

                           FLETCHER
                     (to Frank)
              She's got him by the short ones,
              doesn't she, Frank?
     Frank squelches a smile at Henry.   Where did he learn
     that?
                           FRANK
              Yeah, she makes him nervous.
     They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and
     hurries inside.

48   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     48
     Nicki is cutting fruit at the bar. Rachel, very tense,
     is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink
     she's making in a blender.
     Rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her
     neck and shoulders. Spector is perched on a bar stool
     like a vulture. Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki
     gives him a look.
                           RACHEL
              I want him gone.
                           DEVANEY
              What is it now?
                           NICKI
              He told Rachel no Sunday brunch
              at Charlie's.
                           DEVANEY
              No Sunday brunch. That's why you
              called me up here?
                           RACHEL
              That is not it! It's my money
              and my life and I want him out
              of here.
                              DEVANEY
              Where is he?
     Nicki indicates through the glass door.    Devaney walks
     over to it.

                                                         39.


                      NICKI
         On the patio.
                      RACHEL
         He's through messing with my life.

                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick
         of running up here every time he
         steps on your toes.
                (leaning out the
                 glass door)
         Farmer! Would you come in here
         a minute?

Devaney walks back toward Rachel.
                      RACHEL
         Did you know he was nuts?
                      SPECTOR
         Do you know who couldn't get
         past the gates yesterday?
                        RACHEL
         Who?
                      SPECTOR
         Robin Leach, that's who.
Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting
off a laugh. Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight
face, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from
the sliding door.
                      SPECTOR
         You think that's funny? The
         man talks to 20 million people
         and he can't even get in here.
                      FRANK
         Did he have an appointment?
Devaney turns to him.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, what is this about
         brunch at Charlie's? Rachel's
         been going there every Sunday
         for the last five years.
                      FRANK
         I don't want her doing anything
         she's always done.

                                                           40.

                      RACHEL
                (mimicking him)
         'I don't want her doing anything
         she's always done.' The guy's a
         fanatic.
                      DEVANEY
         So are the guys he's protecting
         you from.
                      RACHEL
         Excuse me if I don't faint.
                      NICKI
         Think of Fletcher --

Rachel turns ON the BLENDER, drowning out Nicki's voice.
Frank looks at Rachel coolly. She stares at him
petulantly, then turns OFF the BLENDER.
                      RACHEL
         Do you know he's got the phones
         bugged?
                      SPECTOR
         Oh Jesus, Bill.
                      RACHEL
         Maybe he gets off listening to my
         calls. All that heavy breathing...
                      DEVANEY
                (interrupting)
         What do you want from my life?
                      RACHEL
         I want some peace around here.
                      SPECTOR
         That's right.
Devaney looks at Frank imploringly.
                      FRANK
         We're almost done.
                      RACHEL
         And I want to be able to eat
         brunch with my friends.
                      FRANK
         Go on Tuesday this week.
Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian.

                                                                       41.

                            SPECTOR
                      (stretching it out)
               Tuesday -- morning -- brunch.
               Where did you find this guy?
      Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank.


48A   EXT. THRIFT SHOP - VALLEY - DAY                             48A
      Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.    It's
      a decidedly downscale area. A little way  off, a   group
      of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo   with
      interest. Henry sits  at the wheel. Tony  stands   by the
      open window, leaning against the car.

                            HENRY
                      (looking at the
                       youths)
               I wish Rachel didn't keep coming
               here. It makes me nervous.
                            TONY
               Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous
               'cos I got you with me.

49    INT. THRIFT SHOP - CLOSE ON CLOTHES HANGER - DAY            49
      SCREECHING as it's slid along a metal rack.
      Rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of
      discarded clothing.
                            RACHEL
               Louise, you've got too much great
               stuff.
                            OWNER
                      (from the back of
                       the shop, laughing)
               Take it all, darlin'.
      Frank leans casually against a wall, not watching Rachel,
      but watching the shop, watching the street outside.
      Rachel finds something she likes.
                             RACHEL
               Wooo!   Let me try this on.
      She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her.
      She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing
      booth, then stops dramatically.

                                                            42.

                      RACHEL
                (to Frank, indicating
                 the open booth)
         Farmer, do you want to come in
         here with me? Just to be safe?
Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of
the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the
curtain as she changes.
                      RACHEL
         You probably won't believe this,
         but I have a reputation for being
         a bitch.
Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store-
front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next
to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One
of them is climbing onto the hood.
                      RACHEL
         I didn't used to be. But you get
         known for being a certain way --
         a way people think you are -- and
         pretty soon you get like that.
         Can't help it.
Frank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices.
                      RACHEL
         You don't think so? You're such
         an expert on famous people?
                      FRANK
         I've seen a few.
                      RACHEL
         And you disagree?
                      FRANK
                (very flat)
         You can be as you choose to be.
         It's an act of discipline
         sometimes, but it can be done.
Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and
looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the
mirror is Frank.
                      RACHEL
         That why you never stay with one
         of your clients? They too
         undisciplined for you? Or is it
         you're afraid you'll start to
         care about them?

                                                         43.

                      FRANK
                (without interest)
         That's right.
Rachel turns to Frank.
                      RACHEL
         Can't you answer straight just
         once? Why don't you talk to
         me? I'm not such a bad lady.
                      FRANK
         You're too clever for me.   I can't
         keep up.
Frank continues to search the shop and street with his
gaze. Rachel steps closer to him.
                      RACHEL
         Look at me, Farmer!
Frank turns and looks at her.
                      RACHEL
         You don't approve of me, do you?
                      FRANK
         Disapproval's a luxury I can't
         afford. Gets in the way.
                      RACHEL
         Don't like emotions getting to you,
         huh? Never mix business with
         pleasure?
                      FRANK
         That's right.
It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to
an outfit on a rack just behind him.
                      RACHEL
         Grab that would you?
Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window.
                      FRANK
         I'm here to keep you alive... not
         to help you shop.
Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself,
whipping the curtain shut behind her.
A smile plays across Frank's face.

                                                                     44.

50   INT. DARKENED ROOM - CLOSEUP - NIGHT                       50
     We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its
     sleeve. The cover reads "RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS."
     The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video
     player.

     Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly,
     intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO
     the image, as if a little hypnotized by it.
     ANGLE FRANK
     Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV,
     dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's
     watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video
     player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's,
     tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on
     the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases
     are circled.
     As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression.
     It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first
     time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to
     be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable.
     He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian
     Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that
     it holds, then looks back to the screen.

51   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - NIGHT                                 51
     Rachel's SONG PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate.

52   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              52
     The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty
     apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls
     on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed
     for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her,
     fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming
     from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser
     moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing
     across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room
     and hears her own voice singing out from there too.

53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53
     Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the
     limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched
     beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel,
     dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from
     the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a
     videotape. Tony follows as they head for the car, where

                                                          45.

Frank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the
doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves
at Frank.
                      FRANK
                (to Henry)
         I thought it was dinner.

Henry shrugs.
                      FRANK
                (to Spector)
         Are we going somewhere else?
                      SPECTOR
         The Mayan, Frank.

                      FRANK
         What's the Mayan?
Spector starts to climb into the limo.
                      SPECTOR
         It's a club, Frank. Come on,
         Henry, let's go.
                      FRANK
         Spector, you've got to tell me
         about these things.
                       SPECTOR
         I just did.
He disappears inside the limo.
Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down,
brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.
                      RACHEL
         Nice suit, Frank.
Rachel is about to get in.
                       FRANK
         Rachel.
He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled
cross.
                      FRANK
         I want you to keep this.
Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.
                       RACHEL
         For me?   It's beautiful.

                                                                     46.

                           FRANK
              It's fitted with a radio
              transmitter. When you close the
              clasp, it sends a signal. If
              there's ever a problem and we're
              separated, just press it and I'll
              know you need me.

     Rachel doesn't know how to respond. She's stuck for
     words. Spector pokes his head out impatiently.
                           SPECTOR
              Okay, she knows how it works,
              let's get going.
     Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the
     back. Frank gets in the front beside Tony. The limo
     pulls out.

54   INT. LIMO - NIGHT (LATER)                                  54
     Frank rides beside Tony in the front seat. The RADIO
     PLAYS SOFTLY in the b.g. In back, Rachel, Spector and
     Devaney are drinking champagne. Tony burps, smiles
     at Frank.
                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)
              You're listening to K.R.O.K., the
              rock of L.A. and yes we have.
                           (MORE)
                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              We told you we'd crack the case
              of the mystery guest... and if
              you are one of the few who hasn't
              heard, it's Rachel at the Mayan.
     Franks turns UP the VOLUME.
                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)
              Rachel Marron, tonight, appearing
              as Billy Thomas' very special
              guest. But if you don't have a
              ticket, you can forget going
              down there. Police are asking
              us to ask you to stay away. So
              everybody, please stay cool,
              stay tuned and we'll try to get
              you some interviews after the
              show. Remember, you heard it
              here on K.R.O.K. -- the station
              that delivers.
     Frank looks back at Spector who silently mouths --

                                                                       47.

                           SPECTOR
              It wasn't me.
     The car turns a corner and there it is, The Mayan only
     fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the
     club, off the sidewalk and into the street.

                              TONY
              Fuckin' a.
     Spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of
     the limo. Frank stares ahead in disbelief. The NOISE
     of the CROWD can be heard as they pull up front.

55   EXT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                       55

     The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which
     turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage.
     Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel.
     Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy
     as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man
     is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz
     light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody
     squints at the glare.

56   EXT. BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                              56
     As Rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly
     at the curb with blood streaming from his nose.
     A pair of security guards try to hold them back.    As her
     limo stops, a chant begins.
                            CROWD
              Rachel!   Rachel! We want Rachel!
     Others join in as the mob presses forward.
     The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public
     -- a wide, show-biz smile. Sandwiched between Spector and
     Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel
     makes her entrance.
     A young man breaks the barrier   moving toward Rachel.
     Frank grabs him by one of his   belt loops, gracefully
     guides him all the way across   and slips him under the
     opposite cordon into the arms   of a security guard.

57   INT. RACHEL'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                          57
     Rachel steps into a room set for a star's arrival.
     Flowers are on every surface that will hold them. One
     huge arrangement is so big it has to be placed on the

                                                                     48.

     floor. Frank checks them all with a magnometer wand
     before letting Rachel sit down. He goes out, closing
     the door, watchful.

58   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                     58

     Frank's eyes search the crush of people, milling around
     outside the dressing room. A few feet away, Spector talks
     to a JOURNALIST who's carrying a tape recorder.
                           JOURNALIST
              ... and this is my exclusive?
                           SPECTOR
              I swear I thought she'd talk to
              you. Maybe later. What can I
              say.
     Frank is checked out by a strange-looking women in
     Vampyra Drag.

59   INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                                 59
     Rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver
     headpiece we saw earlier. She notices a small spray of
     lilies-of-the-valley among the floral arrangements.
     An envelope marked "Rachel" is attached to it. She
     reaches forward and opens it.
     We see the note as she unfolds it.
              MARRON BITCH - YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
              I HAVE NOTHING - PREPARE YOUR SOUL
              FOR DEATH - THE TIME TO DIE IS...
     We see the shock in her face.

60   INT. STAR'S SUITE - NIGHT                                  60
     Spector, Frank, and Devaney are there. Rachel seems
     dazed, unfocussed. Devaney hands the note to Frank.
                           DEVANEY
              He sent another one.
     Rachel immediately picks up on this.
                           RACHEL
              What do you mean 'another one'?
     Frank quickly shoots a look at Spector.
                           FRANK
              They didn't tell you.

                                      49.


             RACHEL
Tell me what?
             DEVANEY
There were some letters before,
Rachel... same kind of thing,
threats, oddball stuff...
             SPECTOR
We didn't want to worry you...
             DEVANEY
... and somebody got into the
house...

             RACHEL
       (starting to panic)
Someone was in my house?
              SPECTOR
Okay.   Let's not get hysterical...
             FRANK
Let's get her out of here.
             RACHEL
Someone was in my house?
             SPECTOR
It was weeks ago. You were out of
town...
             RACHEL
While Fletcher was there?
             SPECTOR
Listen, Fletcher is okay. The
house is like Fort Knox now.
Right, Frank?
             FRANK
We should get her out of here.
Right now!
             SPECTOR
There's no way anyone could...
             RACHEL
No way anyone could what?
             SPECTOR
No, wait... look everybody calm
down. Calm down.
             DEVANEY
Sy.

                                                                      50.


                           SPECTOR
              Let's just see how she is.
                     (to Rachel)
              How do you feel, honey?
     Someone comes through the door with some flowers.   Frank
     eases them out and gently closes the door.
                           FRANK
              I can't protect her out there.
                           RACHEL
              Do you think he's out there?
     Devaney can't answer.   She turns to Frank.

                           RACHEL
              He's here, isn't he?
                             FRANK
              He might be.
                           SPECTOR
              We don't know that. Frank, we
              don't know that.
     Rachel is enraged.
                           RACHEL
              But you know he was in my house...
              oh my God.
                           DEVANEY
              Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to
              make an announcement.
                           SPECTOR
              Fine, you make it, they'll tear
              the fucking place apart.

61   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                        61
     A lone mike stands onstage. The crowd's growing im-
     patient. A RHYTHMIC CLAPPING begins. Devaney walks
     timidly onstage. He's not happy to be there. He reaches
     the mike and taps it with a finger.
                           DEVANEY
              Excuse me... hello... I've got
              an announcement to make. I'm
              sorry but... due to circumstances
              beyond...
     Voices shout. "Where's Rachel?"... a groan begins.
     A chorus of boos fills the room. He raises his hands.

                                                                    51.

     More voices.

62   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                    62
     Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit. A roar from
     the audience begins. "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" It
     grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel's expression
     is a combination of fear and humiliation. When they have
     almost reached the exit, she stops.
                              RACHEL
              Wait...
                           FRANK
              Rachel... don't do it.    It's not
              worth it...
                           RACHEL
                     (cutting him off)
              No fucking freak is gonna chase me
              off stage.
     She pulls away from him.    Farmer starts after her, closely
     followed by Spector.

63   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                        63
                           DEVANEY
              I'm afraid that...
     A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's
     befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him.
                           DEVANEY
              Rachel won't be able...
     Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back
     to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his
     direction.
                           RACHEL
              Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen,
              thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone.
              Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the
              greatest. He's asked me to sing
              a song. I hope you don't mind.
     The crowd roars its approval.
     Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves
     along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking
     obvious fear, she starts to sing.
     As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers
     tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.

                                                                   52.


      ANGLE - RACHEL - SHOT FROM BEHIND
      shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center-
      stage.
      Rachel snatches a quick glance at Frank then looks back
      to her silent audience.
      ANGLE - FRANK
      He scans the audience intensely, face to face.

63A   EXT. MAYAN - BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT                        63A

      Rachel's limo stands waiting. CAMERA PULLS BACK to
      reveal a black Toyota 4 X 4 parked among the other cars.

63B   INT. MAYAN - NIGHT                                         63B
      Rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming
      ever stronger. Spector comes up to Frank in the wings,
      positioning himself combatively between Frank and his
      view of Rachel.
                            SPECTOR
               Are we having a communications problem
               here?
                            FRANK
               What?
      Spector's presence is a distraction. Frank steps to one
      side for a better view of Rachel. Spector moves too.
                            SPECTOR
               Apparently, I didn't make it clear
               to you how things go around here.
                            FRANK
               You told me you were going to
               tell her. And you didn't.
                            SPECTOR
               I didn't think she could handle it.
                            FRANK
               But she handled it fine.
      Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his
      vigilance undiminished. Soothed and nurtured by the
      obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is
      beginning to vanish. The song is taking over. Spector
      changes tack, becoming confidential, "man-to-man."

                                                                     53.

                           SPECTOR
              Look. Frank, I know what you're
              saying. I know you want to do
              what's best for her. I understand
              that. You have a job to do here.
              But you have to understand that
              Rachel has a job to do too. And
              that's what she's doing - out
              there. She's working, Frank.
              That's what she does and that's
              where she does it. She's hot
              right now. This is the time for
              her. If she doesn't get out there,
              she's dead. Forget about crazy
              death threats, if she doesn't
              sing, she's dead anyway... Look,
              handled properly, this thing could
              be good for a million dollars'
              worth of free publicity.
     Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a
     wall of curtain ropes.
                           FRANK
              One word.
                           SPECTOR
              It could clinch her the nomination.
                           FRANK
              One word in print about any of
              this...
     Spector nods, half-gasping. Frank tightens his grip.
     Frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the
     crowd.
                           SPECTOR
              Trouble with you is you don't
              understand the sympathy vote.

64   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                         64
     Rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal
     mural.
     Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare.
     The thundering adoration is like a stimulant. She darts
     a look to Frank and gives him a fierce "naughty girl"
     smile.
                           RACHEL
                     (turning back to
                      crowd)
              You like that? Would like to
              hear another? Billy?

                                                                     54.


     From the wings, Billy Thomas gives her the nod to go for
     it. It seems to be alright with everyone. The band
     starts playing a dance beat.
                           RACHEL
                     (on the prowl)
              I think my feet are trying to
              tell me something... wanna see a
              new video?
     The crowd explodes. They know what song is coming.
     They start to move with Rachel.
                           RACHEL
                     (dancing, talking)
              I want to dance...
     She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her
     fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall
     behind her. The crowd surges forward.
     Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the
     crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank
     reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls
     back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on
     the other side. One of the guards darts out like a
     ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and
     scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The
     crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer,
     trying to touch Rachel.
     The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for
     them to back off.
     ANGLE - FRANK
     Frank's task has suddenly become impossible. A forest of
     hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone could be
     the killer. Frank's eyes  dart over them all, his gaze
     intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower.
     RACHEL'S POV
     Looking offstage at Frank. His frustration is almost
     intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of the
     stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank
     starts forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back,
     waving him off.

65   INT. WINGS - NIGHT                                         65
     Spector stands well out of Frank's reach, staring at Rachel
     onstage. He catches Frank's attention, yelling back
     defiantly.

                                                                     55.

                           SPECTOR
              Look at her, fucking great.

66   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                       66
     Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and
     grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd roars
     approval.
     Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV
     KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see
     Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry
     quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward
     the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's
     dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her
     gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending
     to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri-
     cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard
     into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel.
     She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of
     the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans.
     The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing
     Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The
     scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball.

     Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans --
     deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn
     apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears
     into the crowd.
     CLOSE ON RACHEL
     Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally
     and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the
     security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming
     bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues
     on its serene, uninterrupted way.
     FRANK'S POV
     He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings.
     BACK TO SCENE
     Frank grabs it and heads to center stage. He aims the
     extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage.
     The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans.
     Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young
     blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel,
     taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks
     a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.

                                                                       56.

                            FRANK
               Tony, not there.
                            TONY
               I'll take care of this.
     He heads for the door.

                            TONY
               Just follow me.
     He turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull.

67   EXT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                       67

     Tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a
     swath through the crowd. Rain beats down.
                            TONY
               Make way here. Outta the way!
     A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes
     back hard. The  crowd immediately sides with him, yells
     encouragement.  But Tony is the better man and sends him
     sprawling. The  rest of the way to the curb opens up.
     At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and
     turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there.
     A couple of people laugh.

68   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                           68
     Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two
     garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there.
     The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires, narrowly missing
     Spector as he staggers out of the building.
                           SPECTOR
               Hey! What the fuck... Farmer!
               Farmer! Come back here...
     The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the
     street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and
     speechless.

69   INT. LIMO - NIGHT                                            69
     Frank turns and looks at Rachel.    She is diminutive,
     doll-like, alone in the center of   the large limousine
     seat. Her  hands rise to her face   and her body begins to
     shake with sobs as she sits there   alone in the tattered
     remains of her dress.
     Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels

                                                                     57.

     uncomfortable.   Henry senses what is going on and
     speaks softly.
                           HENRY
              Never done that before.
                           FRANK
              It's been a long night.

70   INT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                     70
     The crowd is thinning out. A dim worklight is burning
     somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a mess; the
     cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the
     riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking
     for something.
     Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragment
     of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand
     picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear the
     sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The feet
     move on.

71   INT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  71
     Fletcher is asleep in his bed. Frank waits as Rachel
     glances in. Then she moves away. Opening the door to
     her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead.

72   INT. RACHEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 72
     Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window
     and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door.
     All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he
     approaches her she begins to tremble.
     He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly
     holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of
     Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows.
     Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are
     shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does
     it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and
     not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked
     still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her
     gently into bed.
     As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of
     his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a
     child's.
                           RACHEL
              Aren't you going to ask me why I
              behave like that?

                                                                    58.


                            FRANK
              I know why.

73   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                      73

     Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care-
     fully cutting and eating a peach.  The door at the other
     end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking
     wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he
     is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast.
     Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As
     Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins
     low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from
     under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself
     looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he
     was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed
     against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question-
     ingly, as if to ask, "Had enough?"
     Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony
     stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony
     throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank
     ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and
     throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks
     around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall.
     He holds it in front of him threateningly.
     Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks
     up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in
     his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same
     fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony.
     It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony
     does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks
     up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances
     at Tony.
                           FRANK
              I don't want to talk about this
              again.

74   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAWN                      74
     Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate
     house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man-
     sion.
     The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty.
     We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being
     covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns
     sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit
     and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.

                                                            59.

The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her
manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and
very girlish.
                       RACHEL
         Hey!   Gotcha, didn't I?

                         FRANK
         Hey.
                      RACHEL
         You're probably wondering what I'm
         doing.
                (as Frank nods)
         You didn't know I jogged, did you?

Frank shakes his head.
                      RACHEL
         What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll
         get picked off in my snazzy running
         suit?
                     FRANK
         No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog
         with you.
They both smile.
                        RACHEL
         Great.    I guess I can't do it.
Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment,
rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She
removes it quickly.
                      RACHEL
         Will you walk with me a little?
Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.
                      RACHEL
                (hard for her)
         I know this is kinda late, but
         thank you. I'm really glad you're
         here.
                (she looks at him)
         I'm going to try to cooperate.
                      FRANK
         That would be good.
They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel
finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself,
nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's
a terrific actress.

                                                                   60.

                           RACHEL
              Farmer... I have this problem.
              This minor little problem. You
              see, I'd like to go out for an
              evening. Just me and a guy. You
              know...
                     (makes a funny face)
              ... like a 'date.' But I can't go
              out on a date because you have to
              be with me every minute. I mean,
              what if he invited me up to his
              place afterwards? Are you going
              to come, too?
                     (a beat)
              So the only thing I can figure is
              for you to take me out.
                     (pause)
              So... that's what I was wondering
              ... you know. What do you think?
              But only if you want to.
     Frank is bemused.
                           RACHEL
              Only if you want to... I'm not so
              bad...
                     (looks at him)
              God, this is embarrassing. I'm
              gonna run up ahead there. You
              decide.
     She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above
     them. He walks up after her.

75   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - BALCONY - DAY                       75
     Nicki is yelling from a window on the second floor of
     the mansion. Fletcher peers out with her.
                             NICKI (O.S.)
              Rachel!    Sandy Harris is on the
              phone!
     Rachel and Frank look up.
                           RACHEL
              Tell her she'll have to wait,
              babe. I'm getting fixed up here.
     AT WINDOW - CLOSE ON NICKI
     She watches Frank and Rachel, her expression neutral.
     She turns away. Fletcher continues to watch his mother
     with Frank.

                                                                       61.

76   INT. DAN-DEE CAR WASH-O-RAMA (L.A.) - WASH TUNNEL -          76
     DAY
     The SOUND is DEAFENING. A wet car comes out of the
     tunnel of machinery. In the distance, glimpsed through
     the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers
     as he waits for the limo to be cleaned.

     Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily
     and fast over the hood and windshield. A black in his
     early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car.
     A second pair of hands appear.    White hands in rubber
     gloves. They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum
     suction hose inside.  The hands   switch ON the car RADIO,
     loud. Loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car.
     The hose works its way over the   front seats.
                           D.J. (V.O.)
              ... And here's another biggie
              from a lady very much in the news
              these days, Miss Rachel Marron...
     We see the owner of the hands. It is the young blond
     man Frank kicked aside at the MAYAN. His name is DAN.
     His face is impassive.
                           D.J. (V.O.)
              ... the hit song from the movie...
              Queen Of The Night... I Have
              Nothing.
     The song begins and Rachel's voice fights the din. In
     the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing
     into all the crevices of the upholstery. It sucks up a
     crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap
     beside the rear seat. The hose is switched off and the
     gloved hands retrieve the picture.

77   INT. LOCKER ROOM - WASH-A-RAMA - DAY                         77
     Tight, shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination
     padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo
     inside.
     As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the
     locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker
     are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her
     dancing with the word "whore" scrawled across it. Taped
     to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a
     holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the
     MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to
     it.

                                                                    62.

84   INT. FBI LABORATORY - DAY                                 84
     Special Agent Court is seated next to a white-coated
     technician. The technician is leaning over one of the
     neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier.
     With a scalpel, he lifts the word "whore" from out of the
     message. He sets it on a white sheet, then brings the
     blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on
     the letter.

     CUTTING DOWN HIS ATTACKERS

85   EXT. KOKUSAI THEATRE - NIGHT                              85

     Frank and Rachel exit with a small crowd.    Rachel wears a
     scarf and tinted glasses. The combination    goes a long
     way toward disguising her. They pause at    one of the dis-
     play windows. Inside is a poster for the    movie, Yojimbo,
     a large picture of Toshiro Mifune looking   scruffy and
     fierce.
                            RACHEL
               Well, he didn't look like he
               wanted to die to me.
                           FRANK
              There's a big difference between
              wanting to die and having no fear
              of death.
     They walk down the sidewalk.
                           RACHEL
              And because he had no fear of
              death, he was invincible?
                           FRANK
              What do you think?
                           RACHEL
              Well, he sure creamed 'em all in
              the end.
                           FRANK
              Yeah, it was a good movie.
     They walk off down the sidewalk.
                           RACHEL
              How many times have you seen it?
                           FRANK
              Sixty-two.

                                                                 63.

86   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                       86
     It's a bit of a dive, but the food is good and the atmos-
     phere is great.
                           RACHEL
              Your kinda place?

     Frank nods.
                            FRANK
              Yeah.
                           RACHEL
              Your kinda music?

     As she smiles:
                            FRANK
              Absolutely.
                           RACHEL
              You figure no one can get by you
              here?
                           FRANK
              If someone is willing to swap his
              life for a kill, nothing can stop
              him.
                            RACHEL
              Great.   What do I need you for?
                           FRANK
              He might get me instead.
                           RACHEL
              And you're ready to die for me?
                           FRANK
              That's my job.
     Rachel looks at him.
                           RACHEL
              And you'd do it? Why?
                           FRANK
              I can't sing.
                           RACHEL
              Maybe there's some glory in saving
              a president or something, but just
              anyone...
                           FRANK
              You mean like you?    It's a matter

                                                         64.

          of conditioning and discipline.
                       RACHEL
          I don't trust discipline. At the
          crucial moment I'd cop out.
                       FRANK
          That happens.
                       RACHEL
          But not with you, Fierce Frank.
                         FRANK
          It happens.
A beat.

                       RACHEL
          Have you ever liked anybody?
                       FRANK
          What do you mean?
                       RACHEL
          Like me -- a girl.
Frank knows what she's driving at. But he's not at all
happy to relinquish this information.
                       FRANK
          A long time ago.
                       RACHEL
          What happened? Do you mind if I
          ask?
                       FRANK
          Do you mind if I don't answer?
                       RACHEL
          I don't want to pry...
Frank smiles at that.
                       RACHEL
                 (begins to laugh,
                  can't help herself)
          She didn't die did she? You
          weren't like... protecting her and
          she got killed?
Frank is silent, grim.    Rachel looks stricken.
                         RACHEL
          Oh, my god!    That's it, isn't it?

                                                                   65.

                           FRANK
              Nobody's perfect.
     Rachel is taken aback.
                           RACHEL
              Oh Frank, I'm sorry.

     Frank laughs.
                           FRANK
              No... Nice try though.
                     (pause)
              It was less dramatic than that.
              She didn't love me anymore. Can
              you imagine such a thing?

     Frank puts a smiling spin on this last; it's pretty
     charming. Rachel looks at him.
                           RACHEL
              No, not really.
     A SONG comes on the JUKEBOX -- 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN
     HEARTED.' Frank smiles as Rachel begins to sing.
                           RACHEL
              So, is this a full service date,
              Frank?
     Frank's wary.
                           RACHEL
              I'm just asking you to dance.

87   INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT                                 87
     Frank and Rachel navigate a tiny dance floor. Frank is a
     surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this
     close to her.
     Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song.   As
     we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head.
                           RACHEL
              You like this?
                              FRANK
              Yeah.
     A beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing.
                            FRANK
                      (reddening)
              What?

                                                                      66.

                           RACHEL
                     (trying to compose
                      herself)
              I'm sorry... It's just that...
              It's so depressing.
     Now they're both laughing.

                           FRANK
                     (grinning)
              It is, isn't it.
     Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing,
     makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between
     Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source
     of the noise.

                           RACHEL
              Don't worry, I'll protect you.
     They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank
     watching.

88   EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  88
     Frank's car is parked in the driveway.    A light goes on
     in a basement window.

89   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT                               89
     Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the
     basement. Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/
     target range/weapons workshop. The place has a kind of
     unfussy order about it, a simplicity.
                           RACHEL
                     (almost to herself)
              It's very quiet here.
     She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of
     books, football and karate trophies, framed citations
     and other memorabilia. She glances at a dusty framed
     photo of a football team.
                           RACHEL
                     (reading)
              West Virginia University Football.
              God, look at you.
     She looks at Frank, quizzically.
                           RACHEL
              What'd you play?

                                                           67.

                        FRANK
         End.
                      RACHEL
         Were you tough?
                        FRANK
         No.    Fast.
Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai
sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She
looks at it, peering closely.
                      RACHEL
         You some kind of a samurai, too?

Frank smiles.
                      RACHEL
         They said you were in the Secret
         Service. What made you get out?
Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall.
                        FRANK
         Money.
Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home.
                      RACHEL
         I can see your tastes are
         extravagant.
She looks at Frank and then back at the sword.   She
reaches out to touch it.
                        RACHEL
         May I?
Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully,
unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.
                      FRANK
         Watch yourself.
Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is
breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her.
She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the
blade at him.
                      RACHEL
         You're a hard one to figure, Frank
         Farmer.
He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only
about a foot from his face.

                                                                      68.

                           RACHEL
              It seems to me a bodyguard must
              know little peace.
     Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only
     about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the
     blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is
     wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other
     hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.
                            FRANK
              Watch this.
     He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space
     between them. With two hands he spreads    it out and then
     lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down
     over the blade and is cut in two. These    two pieces float
     slowly to the floor.
     Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to
     the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her
     body against Frank's and they begin to kiss.

90   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                        90
     Their lovemaking is INTERCUT with SLOW MOTION black and
     white images of Samurai warriors from the movie,
     Yojimbo.

91   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER                        91
     They lie nude under a sheet.
                           RACHEL
              I've never been this safe before.
     Frank smiles.
                           RACHEL
              No one could get by you.
                           FRANK
              Right now it might not be so hard.
     Rachel laughs, kisses him and buries her head down into
     his shoulder. Frank stares across the bed at the samurai
     sword lying on the floor. Some of Rachel's clothing is
     draped in a heap across it. The torn pieces of her scarf
     lie nearby. HOLD ON Frank's look.
                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:
92   INT. FRANK'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING                         92
     The roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound.
     Frank is moving around the room, getting dressed. Rachel

                                                            69.

is still in the bed behind him, woken by the noise of his
activity.
                     RACHEL
         What? What is it? What are you
         doing?

Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes.
                         RACHEL
         Frank?
                      FRANK
         Rachel, I don't want to get
         confused about what I'm doing
         here.

                      RACHEL
         I'm not confused.
Frank finds his shoes.
                      FRANK
         You pay me to protect you, that's
         what I do.
Rachel sits up.
                     RACHEL
         What? Have I done something
         wrong?
                         FRANK
         No, nothing.
                      RACHEL
         Then what is it?
She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top
of it.
                      RACHEL
         Do you want me to beg?
                      FRANK
         No, I want you to do without.
She stops.
                      RACHEL
         What's going on, Frank?
                      FRANK
         I want to keep it straight in my
         head what job I'm doing.

                                                              70.

                      RACHEL
         And what is that exactly?    Making
         me feel like shit?
                      FRANK
         No, I'm sorry. This is my fault.

                      RACHEL
         Don't apologize for godsake. Just
         tell me what I did. I'm a big
         girl.
                      FRANK
         You didn't do anything. It was me.
         I involved myself with my client.

Rachel picks up on the word.
                      RACHEL
         Your "client"?
                      FRANK
         I made a mistake.
                      RACHEL
         What mistake?... You don't find me
         attractive anymore.
                      FRANK
         Christ! I've told you why. I
         can't protect you like this.
                       RACHEL
         And what?   That's it for me?
                      FRANK
         Yeah...
                      RACHEL
         I don't believe it.
He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the
holster.
                      FRANK
         You can live with that or you can
         fire me.
                      RACHEL
         But I can't fuck you.
Frank turns and looks at her.    This is hard for him, too.
                      RACHEL
         I don't believe this...
         I'm asking you?... Let me tell
         you...

                                                                     71.


     She stops suddenly and, with a roar of combined frus-
     tration, humiliation and rage, she lurches from the bed
     in search of her clothes. Frank shuts his eyes in morti-
     fication and pain.


93   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOLSIDE - EARLY MORNING              93
     A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering.
     Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's
     putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher
     watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the
     batteries, much preoccupied.
                              FLETCHER
                        (watching him)
                 She's real mad at you, isn't she?
     Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the
     batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence.
                              FLETCHER
                 She told me she doesn't understand
                 why you're so shitty to her...
     Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible
     sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still
     not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning,
     it's almost like a confessional.
                              FRANK
                 I've spent a lot of time learning
                 not to react to things like other
                 people do. It's my job. But it
                 doesn't always work, Fletcher...
                 it doesn't always work.
                              FLETCHER
                 I don't think I understand.
                              FRANK
                        (looks at him)
                 I'm an old man compared to you,
                 pal, and I don't understand either.
                 And I'm starting to get the
                 feeling I never will.
     There's a crunch of footsteps behind him.       He looks
     around.
     With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down
     in front of us, front page upwards.
                             NICKI (O.S.)
                 Ta Da!

                                                                    72.

     Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety,
     lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the
     top, the headlines announce the day's news of the
     Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the
     Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows.
     Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands
     beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.

                           NICKI
                     (looking at him)
              Thought you'd like to know.
              Everyone said she was a sure thing.
              Of course, you know all about that.
     She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks
     steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail
     beside the magazines... several letters and a small
     packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.
                           NICKI
              I'm sorry. That was out of line.
              It's none of my business... Here's
              today's question marks for you.
     She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank
     watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile.
     From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then
     pushes his boat out into the deep water.

94   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY     94
     Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's
     precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal
     detector, sniffing at it.
     It has been addressed in the normal way, except that
     Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted
     above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the
     wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are
     still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with
     tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box
     and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a
     bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags.
     The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item --
     it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted
     sign hung around its neck:
                     WE LOVE YOU, RACHEL
                     YOUR FANS IN BEAVER, PA.
                     SALLY AND KATE.
     The beaver's TEETH CLICK in Frank's hand.
     We see Frank's face. This may just have taken years off
     his life. He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards,

                                                                   73.

     and looks at it.   No tremor.   Just checking.
     Spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office.
                            SPECTOR (O.S.)
              Farmer!   Get in here!


95   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY   95
     The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and
     flowers heralding the morning's news. Spector's secretary
     is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the
     b.g. Two assistants are struggling in through the door
     with a large basketed floral arrangement.

     Spector confronts Frank across his desk.
                           SPECTOR
              Put together a list of   your
              expenses. Your total    billing...
              Let me have it in one   hour and
              I'll see that a check   is cut.
                           FRANK
              Don't you ever say what's on your
              mind?
     Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed --
     especially in front the staff. The assistants stop in
     their tracks and look.
                           SPECTOR
                     (almost shouts)
              What's on my mind is that you're
              fired, Frank. She missed all her
              interviews yesterday because of
              your little date. Do you realize
              she stood up Barbara Walters?
              First you fuck up her career...
     Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and
     Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They
     also stop and listen.
                           SPECTOR
              ... and now you're fucking with
              her head.
                           FRANK
              That's between us.
                           SPECTOR
              You think so? You forget who signs
              your check. You don't understand
              the role I play around here.

                                                              74.

                       FRANK
         No.   I understand.
Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.
                      SPECTOR
         Get your shit together and be out
         of here by noon.
                        DEVANEY
         Frank stays.
Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have
been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of
his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the
room. Devaney weighs in.

                      DEVANEY
         With this high a profile, Rachel
         needs protection now more than
         ever. If he goes, you can forget
         Miami...
                      SPECTOR
         She's signed the fucking contract,
         Bill. You want me to read it to
         you?
Rachel is watching them both.
                      DEVANEY
         Fuck the contract. If he goes,
         she's not singing a note. It's
         too dangerous.
                      SPECTOR
         Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great.
         Why don't you let Rachel speak for
         herself? I think she has some say
         in this.
                      RACHEL
                (flatly)
         Frank stays.
Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others.
The secretary interrupts from the back of the office.
                      SECRETARY (O.S.)
         Mr. Schiller calling on line one...
Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney,
Rachel and Frank.
                      SPECTOR
         Well, I guess this is democracy in
         action.

                                                             75.


Rachel nods. Spector, turning to take the call, flashes
her a "little boy" look.
                     SPECTOR
         I gave in. That's not easy for
         me. Don't I get a hug?

Rachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the
phone.
                      SPECTOR
                (into phone)
         Yeah?... Sure, put him on... Ben
         how are you?... uh huh...

Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence.
                      SPECTOR
         ...The Ambassador? What the hell
         are you trying to pull, Ben?
         Rachel always gets the
         Presidential... I don't care what
         you thought...
Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues
in the b.g.
                      DEVANEY
         Do you know the Fontainebleau
         Hotel in Miami Beach?
Frank nods.
                      DEVANEY
         How does the Ambassador Suite
         compare to the Presidential for
         us?
Frank thinks only for a moment.
                      FRANK
         It's on the twentieth    floor in the
         south wing. There's a     service
         elevator right there.     Mainly
         ocean windows. Should     be no
         problem.
                      SPECTOR
                (into phone)
         ... I'm aware of that, Ben, but
         let me just remind you people
         that you invited us...
Frank turns toward the door.

                                                                     76.

                           RACHEL
                     (to Frank)
              Hang around, Farmer. We might
              need your vaunted expertise.
     She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk,
     throwing the call onto a speaker.

                           RACHEL
                     (sweetly)
              Hello, Ben honey.
                           SCHILLER (V.O.)
              Rachel, congratulations, you must
              be thrilled at the...

                           RACHEL
                     (across him)
              Ben. I hear you've got me in the
              annex next to the kitchen.

96   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL (MIAMI BEACH) - HELICOPTER SHOT 96
     - DAY
     We COME STREAKING IN OVER the ocean TOWARD the towering
     white Fontainebleau.
     ON the SOUNDTRACK, we hear JOHN TESH'S VOICE filling the
     viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt.
                           JOHN TESH (V.O.)
              ...It's off to Sun City today for
              Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron.
              Rachel's giving two AIDS charity
              concerts this week at Miami's
              Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a
              plate no less. And rumor has it
              that the lovely lady has unseated
              the governor of Florida himself.
              Seems there was a showdown on
              who'll get to lounge in that big
              Fontainebleau penthouse tonight.
     As we CIRCLE the top floor, we see a tiny figure on the
     balcony.
                           JOHN TESH (V.O.)
              Well, sleep tight in the
              Presidential Suite, Rachel. Who
              says a nomination isn't as good as
              winning...

97   EXT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BALCONY - DAY                    97
     Frank looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down

                                                                   77.

     over the edge and around the corner. He leans slightly
     against the wrought iron railing. It sways precariously.
     Frank catches himself.
                            FRANK
              Thuringer.

     Frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to
     the cement balcony: the cement crumbles around it, a
     weld joint is broken on the side. THURINGER, the hotel
     security chief, joins Frank on the balcony. Frank shakes
     the railing.
                             THURINGER
              God damn.    I'll get someone right
              on it.


98   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY                            98
     Frank walks quickly across the living  room of the lavish
     suite.  Two uniformed security guards  are making a sweep
     of the room with POLICE DOGS. Frank   checks the drawer of
     a side table and then seals it with a  peel-off security
     tape.  Thuringer is waiting near the  entrance hall.
     Frank nods to him.
                            FRANK
              Okay.   Let's go.

99   INT. HALLWAY - 15TH FLOOR - DAY                          99
     This is a semi-private corridor; several hotel employees
     are steam-cleaning the carpet. Frank looks at them, then
     Thuringer.
                           THURINGER
              It's okay, they've been cleared.
     He shows his clipboard to Frank. As the two men walk
     along the corridor, the guest elevator opens and a
     twelve-year-old boy in a bathing suit (MARK KATZ) steps
     out, accompanied by his nanny. In the background, hotel
     security men are checking fire-extinguishers and closets.
                           THURINGER
                     (to Frank)
              The Katzes of St. Louis. Very
              prominent. Come every year. An
              elderly couple and three
              grandchildren. A nurse and a maid.
     They pass the little boy as he reaches the door of the
     Katz suite with his nanny.

                                                                  78.

                            THURINGER
               Hi, Mark.
                            MARK
               Hi.
      Frank smiles and nods to the nanny.

                            THURINGER
                      (to Frank)
               Theirs is the only suite on the
               floor.
      The two men reach the service elevator and the emergency
      exit door at the end of the hall. Frank opens the stair-
      way door and goes inside. Thuringer follows.

                            THURINGER
               As you asked, the rooms below have
               been kept vacant.

100   INT. STAIRWAY - DAY                                       100
      The doorway closes behind the two men. Frank tries it;
      it's locked. They continue down the stairs.

105   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                        105
      Frank and Thuringer walk into and along the edge of the
      busy kitchen.

109   INT. OFFSTAGE AREA - DAY                                  109
      Frank walks ahead of Thuringer. He looks around and
      pauses at the edge of the stage. Then he steps out on a
      stage. A piano tuner is at work in the corner.

110   INT. ON STAGE - DAY                                       110
      FRANK'S POV -
      as he looks out at the mammoth room.
      Frank stands center stage and looks around. The naked-
      ess of this spot gets to him. He shakes his head and
      looks at Thuringer. Thuringer smiles.
                            FRANK
               What a silly job this is.

                                                                     79.

111   INT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - LOWER LOBBY - DAY                 111
      Behind the glass doors that lead to the pool, bright
      quartz lights clock on. A camera crew stands waiting.
      Someone mimes a "we're rolling" sign with his hands.
      Inside Rachel waits with Spector and BEN SCHILLER, the
      tough, fat fellow who owns the place. Frank is at her
      elbow.
                            SPECTOR
               O.K. Rachel. It's showtime!
               They're rolling. Let's go.
                            FRANK
               Is this really necessary?

                               SPECTOR
               Yes.   It is.
                            RACHEL
               Quit bitching, Farmer. This is
               the part you do get paid for.
      Rachel sweeps out the door.    The camera crew hurries to
      keep up with her.

112   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                         112
      This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking on
      chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as
      far as the eye can see. The sight    of the crowd and the
      presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a
      whole new adrenaline level.
      Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the
      bodies displayed before her in words and expressions,
      playing to the camera.
                           RACHEL
               Oh my God. Look what they're
               wearing. Mother, hide your eyes...
      Heads turn to look.
                            RACHEL
               I couldn't wear that suit... Honey,
               you're naked... Of course, if I
               had a body like that...
      There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests.
      She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests
      throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is
      among them.
      People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run

                                                            80.

to get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are
BROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and
shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon
the filming attempt.
                     SPECTOR
         Great, babe. They got what they
         needed. Let's get back inside.
Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently
easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in
Frank's wake.
Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard
appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.

                      RACHEL
                (to lifeguard)
         You look like a man of good taste
         to me. Come to my party tonight.
                (to Schiller)
         Ben, make sure this boy gets to
         my party.
Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he
gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng
gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering
her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar
chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to
resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,
amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few
bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved
forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs
and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach
him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd
surges again.
Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel
drinks it all in.
                      RACHEL
                (over her shoulder)
         Thank you. Thank you. Come
         tonight and give till it hurts.
With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his
party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of
distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks
on briskly.
                      RACHEL
                (to Spector)
         I'm beginning to wonder about your
         judgement, Sy. Why do I have to
         keep paying my dues if I've
         already arrived?

                                                                      81.

                             SPECTOR
                       (very fast)
                Kick me, beat me... whatever makes
                you feel good. But let's not
                pretend you don't like it. We're
                too close for that. Whipping
                people into a frenzy is why you
                got into it in the first place.
       Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real connec-
       tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of time
       denying. Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose tone
       becomes almost soothing  --
                             SPECTOR
                And it's nothing to be ashamed of,
                either, not for a second. It's a
                gift... and only a handful are
                given it. Many call but few are
                answered.
                             SPECTOR (CONT'D)
                Don't fool with the blessing,
                Rachel. The magic is sustained
                through its use.
                             RACHEL
                Now you're going to tell me about
                magic? Give it a rest will ya...
                             SPECTOR
                I'm done. Not another word...
                       (a crooked smile)
                ... I know you like to be reminded
                sometimes.
       Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job.

113    INT. GRAND CENTRAL ROOM - ON STAGE - NIGHT                113
       In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic.
       She sings, as it was meant to be sung, "I Have Nothing."
       One person does not look at Rachel. He stands in a
       corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows. His
       eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement.
       All alone. Watching.

113A   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - NIGHT                          113A
       Fireworks explode over the water.

                                                                     82.

114   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  114
      In the living room, the first night party is in full
      swing. Crowded. Smoky. Noisy. Fireworks burst outside
      the windows. People clap.
      A mixed bag of upscale partygoers: women in party
      dresses, men in open shirts, etc. A black pianist is
      playing. Two bars at either end of the room. Waiters
      work the room with platters of canapes.

115   INT. RACHEL'S SUITE - OUTSIDE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT      115
      Tony sits in a chair watching TV, a drink in his hand,
      oblivious to all. The lifeguard shuts Rachel's door be-
      hind him and makes his way down to the party. He pauses
      at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and
      grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Frank
      catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The
      lifeguard responds with a knowing smile.

116   EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUITE - NIGHT                        116
      Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all
      guests are passing.
      As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk
      manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When
      their names have been checked off a master list, they
      walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No
      one likes it, but they all do it.
      Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The
      handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright
      lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media
      event.
      Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his
      face.
      A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is
      cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN.

117   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  117
      Portman makes his way through the crowd to the bar. His
      eyes scan the suite. His gaze settles on Frank checking
      out the people who filter in. Portman appears next to
      Frank.
                            PORTMAN
               Hello, Farmer.

                                                           83.

                      FRANK
         Portman.
                      PORTMAN
         Buy you a drink?
                      FRANK
         Orange juice. It's been awhile.
         You on the job?
                      PORTMAN
                (nods)
         Technically I'm off duty,   but the
         Governor may show up here   later,
         so I thought I'd give it   a light
         check.
                (smiles)
         Someone else is covering   him right
         now.
                      FRANK
         How old is she?
                      PORTMAN
         Maybe eighteen. You working?
Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the
landing above the crowd, accepting applause. She has
succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She
is a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his
client.
                      PORTMAN
                (impressed)
         No kidding? I'd call that a step
         up from the President. Probably
         sings better too.
                       RACHEL
         Thank you.   Thank you.   You're
         so right.
SCATTERED LAUGHS.
                      RACHEL
         I want everyone to have a good
         time and drink as much of Ben
         Schiller's liquor as you like.
Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing
kisses.
                      PORTMAN
         Handful.
Frank's look says if you only knew the half of it.

                                                           84.

                        PORTMAN
           I heard you had to take someone
           out in New York.
Frank remembers.
                        PORTMAN
           I lost track of you after the
           Reagan thing.
                          FRANK
           Yeah.
                        PORTMAN
           It wasn't your fault, Farmer.
           You weren't even there.

A pause.
                        PORTMAN
           I got a call a couple of months
           ago. That guy you were covering
           in New York. He said you'd
           recommended me.
                          FRANK
           Surprised?
                          PORTMAN
           A little.
                        FRANK
                  (smiles)
           I never doubted your skills.
                        PORTMAN
                  (laughs, good-
                   natured)
           No. Only my qualifications for
           the priesthood. You were always
           clear about that. Anyway, I
           appreciate it. I had to turn it
           down but I appreciate it.
Portman notices Rachel looking at him, as she makes her
way to them. Rachel takes Frank's orange juice and sips.
Makes a very funny face.
                        RACHEL
           That's orange juice!
Rachel gives Portman an approving once-over.
                          RACHEL
           Who are you?

                                                                   85.

                            PORTMAN
               Greg Portman.
                            RACHEL
               I take it you've met my bodyguard?
                            PORTMAN
               We used to work together.
                            RACHEL
                      (suddenly more
                       interested)
               Ah... Well, well, well.    And what
               do you do now?
                            PORTMAN
               Same thing as Farmer.
                            RACHEL
                      (looking between
                       them)
               Two samurai, eh?
      Frank and Portman eye each other.
                            RACHEL
                      (to Portman)
               Are you working now?
                            PORTMAN
               Not right now.
                            RACHEL
               Good.
                      (she takes his arm)
               'cause I'm the only one in the
               room who needs protection.
      She gives Frank a look and leads Portman into the crowd.

118   EXT. LIVING ROOM BALCONY - LATER                           118
      Rachel's taking a breather on the balcony, drinking cham-
      pagne, talking to Portman and another couple. Everybody's
      high and happy. Conversation bubbles.
      FRANK'S POV
      Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper
      intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns
      her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant,
      defiant. Portman does not see this.

119   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   119

                                                                    86.

      Tony helps himself to a handful of canapes, he turns at
      the sound of a COMMOTION out on the balcony. Someone's
      horsing around, spraying champagne from a bottle over
      everyone. A woman screams. Frank   bolts for the balcony.

121   EXT. ON BALCONY - NIGHT                                           121

      Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over
      the railing. Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's
      wrist and tugs at the pair of them.
      Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back
      from the edge.
                            FRANK
               What happened!
                            PORTMAN
               Somebody tripped. It's okay.
                            RACHEL
                      (looking at Portman)
               Thank God I had a bodyguard here.
      She grasps the railing and looks over.
      RACHEL'S POV
      Staring down twenty stories of distance between her and the
      pool area.
      Way, way below her, her champagne GLASS hits the tile
      with a MUFFLED SHATTERING sound.
                            RACHEL
               It's a long way down, Frank.
                      (to Portman)
               You saved my life.
      Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture.   It has
      held.
      Rachel takes Portman by the arm.   The front of her dress
      is stained with champagne.
                            RACHEL
               Maybe someone will keep an eye
               on me while I change.
      She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward
      her bedroom. Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman
      shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.

122   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    122

                                                                   87.

      Frank walks to the bar taking a drink from his glass. He
      looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees Rachel and
      Portman in the hall outside her bedroom. She turns her
      head to look directly at Frank's reflected face. Assured
      that Frank is watching, she takes Portman's hand and leads
      him into her room.

      Frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it
      with orange juice. A stunning WOMAN IN GREEN glides down
      the bar and stands very close to Frank.
                            WOMAN IN GREEN
               I've been watching you all night
               from across the room.
                            FRANK
               Why don't you go back there and
               keep watching?
      Frank looks at Rachel's doorway, sipping his juice.

123   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              123
      Rachel and Portman are kissing, with some heat.
      Portman's hands are starting to explore her body.

124   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   124
      Frank still looks at Rachel's doorway, thinking. After
      a moment, he walks across the room to the sliding doors
      that lead to the balcony outside.

125   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       125
      Frank steps outside. No one there. The moonlight re-
      flects off the ocean. The SURF sounds a STEADY BEAT.
      It is peaceful and quiet. A relief.
      On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz
      is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's
      suite. Frank smiles at him.
                            FRANK
                      (softly)
               Go to sleep.
      Frank looks out at the ocean. After a pause, in the
      background, Mark slips inside the Katz suite.

126   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              126
      Rachel and Portman are still locked in the clinch.
      Realizing what she's doing, Rachel suddenly pulls back,

                                                                   88.

      catching herself.
                            RACHEL
               I'm not doing this.
                            PORTMAN
                      (still holding her)
               I think you are.
      She steps out of his embrace.
                            RACHEL
               I said I was grateful.   Thank you
               and good night.
      She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The
      SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to
      cross to the door.
                            RACHEL
                      (cool)
               Please go now.
      Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching
      for her arm.
      Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the
      hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of
      the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out
      of Portman's grip.
                            RACHEL
               Mr. Portman was just leaving us,
               Tony.
      Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and,
      with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back
      to the party.
      Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder
      but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her
      alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of
      Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight
      from the bottle.

127   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       127
      Frank looks out at the ocean.
      ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song 'WHAT BECOMES
      OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' that Rachel and Frank danced to.
      It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away.
      Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally divorced from
      everything in the suite behind him, in the world around
      him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this

                                                                     89.

       one moment, his guard is down.

127A   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                127A
       A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor. Rachel steps out
       of her bedroom. She looks terrible. Hungover, she is
       wearing sunglasses and a loose smock. It is noon of the
       following day.

130    INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - KITCHEN - DAY                    130
       Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich.
       Behind him, in the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a
       place with breakfast. She is pouring orange juice as
       Rachel walks in.
       Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had
       been a terrible effort. She looks at the breakfast with
       distaste and picks up the coffee. Frank continues to eat.
       Rachel looks at him.
                               RACHEL
                         (nasty)
                  What the hell are you looking at?
                         (pause)
                  You probably never had a heavy
                  night in your whole, goddamn
                  disciplined life.
       Frank looks at her, continues to eat.
                               RACHEL
                  You know, Farmer, you're a self-
                  righteous son-of-a-bitch.
       Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even
       angrier.
                               RACHEL
                  Don't laugh at me, goddamit!   And
                  don't you dare judge me.
                               FRANK
                  Give me a break, will ya? I
                  didn't tell you to fuck everybody
                  in the hotel!

132    INT. CLEANING SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - DAY                       132
       Special  Agents Court and Minella are watching the general
       manager  of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge
       canister  marked "INDUSTRIAL DETERGENT." The general
       manager  lifts the lid to reveal white powder.

                                                                    90.

      He talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse.
      Court listens, nodding. Minella spoons some of the
      powder into a plastic bag and seals it. OVER this we
      hear Court's voice, filtered as on a telephone line.
                              COURT (V.O.)
                 It matches the traces in the glue,
                 Frank. We're getting to him.
We're gonna nail this fucker.

133   INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - LOBBY - DAY                            133
      Frank is on the courtesy phone.
                             FRANK
                Yeah, well, don't take too long,
                Ray.
                              COURT (V.O.)
                Hey, Frank.   It's good money,
                isn't it?
      Frank hangs up.

134   INT. 20TH FLOOR HALLWAY - OUTSIDE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE -      134
      DAY
      The elevator door opens and  Frank steps out. He
      walks toward the entrance to  the suite and is
      immediately alarmed by what  he sees: there is no
      uniformed guard by the front  door. He unlocks the
      door and goes inside.

135   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - ENTRANCE - DAY                    135
      Frank comes in and looks around quickly.
      FRANK'S POV - LIVING ROOM
      Looking over living room, hallways, balcony.    No one in
      sight. Nothing disturbed.
      Devaney comes out of Rachel's bedroom, a panicked look
      on his face.
      BACK TO SCENE
      They face each other across the gulf of the living
      room.
                             FRANK
                Where is she? Where's Tony?

                                                                     91.

                            DEVANEY
               I don't know. I thought you were
               with her.

138   INT. SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               138

      Frank is at the telephone; he punches out three
      numbers.
                            FRANK
                      (into phone)
               Thuringer, this is Farmer. Where's
               your man on the door to the suite?
                      (listens)
               Well get someone up here.

      Frank hangs up the phone, looks at Devaney.
                            FRANK
               He doesn't know.
      They look at each other, worried. Frank walks out onto
      the balcony, looks round and down, comes back in. He
      heads for the front door.
                            DEVANEY
               Where are you going?

139   INT. SUITE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY                             139
      Frank is almost at the door. We hear LAUGHTER. A key
      turns in the lock. Rachel and Tony come through the
      door in high spirits, their arms full of shopping bags
      and packages.
      Frank stops dead and    watches. Rachel glances at him and
      goes into the living    room. Tony looks at him meaning-
      fully and follows.     Frank reflects for a moment, then
      pulls the front door    closed, oh so gently.

140   INT. SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               140
      Rachel drops packages around and goes to the bar, pours
      herself a drink. Tony takes some packages to Rachel's
      bedroom.
                            RACHEL
               Hello, Devaney.
                            DEVANEY
               Rachel, where the hell have you
               been?

                                                                      92.

                             RACHEL
                Tony and I went over to Bal
                Harbour. Did a little shopping.
       Tony comes back, a smile playing across his lips.    Frank
       watches near the entrance.

                             DEVANEY
                We were worried.
                       (looks at Frank,
                        talks to Rachel)
                You know you're not supposed to do
                that.
       Frank and Rachel look at each other.

                             RACHEL
                Farmer, you work here! Do you
                understand that? You work for me.
                             DEVANEY
                Rachel.
       Frank turns and heads for the door.    Devaney looks at
       him anxiously.
                             DEVANEY
                Farmer, where are you going?
                             FRANK
                I'm gonna check the route.    As
                usual.
       He opens the front door. A uniformed guard is standing
       outside. Frank goes out and closes the door.
                             RACHEL
                Did Fletcher call?
       Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head "no."

141    INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY                                  141
       Frank's face shows the tension and the anger.    The ele-
       vator descends.

141A   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                           141A
       Frank walks along the edge of the kitchen, looks over
       the workers. A kitchen worker is in Frank's path. He
       looks up, sees Frank's face and scurries out of his way.

142    INT. BASEMENT - SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY                       142

                                                                 93.

Frank walks along checking the corridor.        At each door-
way, he stops, looks inside.
One room is dark. He flicks on the light. Near the door
is a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from
the wall.  Frank walks over and looks inside. They are
discarded vegetable crates. Frank goes back to the door
and yells toward the kitchen.
                          FRANK
            Gomez!   Louis Gomez!
He waits impatiently. No one comes. Two quick steps and
he is back at the CRATES, throwing them violently into
the corner where they CLATTER loudly to the floor. Frank
walks on along the corridor.

He stops, noticing something around the side.
He investigates.
An ENORMOUS CUBAN is sitting on some boxes in the
shadows. He doesn't bat an eye when he sees Frank.
                         FRANK
            What are you doing?
                         ENORMOUS CUBAN
            Is none of you fuckin' business.
                           FRANK
            Move it.
The Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes.        He
towers over Frank.
                         ENORMOUS CUBAN
            Shove it up you ass, motherfucker.
Frank has had   enough for one      afternoon. He hits the
Cuban low and   hard. The man       crumples forward, hurt,
but manages to   enfold Frank      in an awesome bear hug. His
weight carries   them backward      in Frank's direction.
The Cuban continues      moving in that direction, but Frank
is no longer in his      grasp. Instead, incredibly, Frank
seems to have passed      through the man's body and flicked
him into the corner      of the stairwell.
The Cuban hits the wall hard. Jarred but not lost, he
comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a
baseball bat.
Frank steps in and      under the man's long arms and hits him
four times around      the chest and jaw. Each of Frank's
hands lands twice,      their movement is barely visible.
The solid THUDDING      tells the story. Frank strikes both

                                                                    94.

       the Cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands.
       The Cuban goes down, stunned. Frank, his expression
       fierce, is upon him immediately. Frank's arms entwine
       the Cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly. At the
       end of the corridor, a woman screams.

                       CLEANING WOMAN (O.S.)
                Stop! Please. Don't hurt him.
                Please stop!
       Frank looks up. A hotel CLEANING WOMAN, carrying her
       purse, is running towards them, tears already on her
       face.
                             CLEANING WOMAN
                Don't hurt my husband, mister.       He
                not up to nothing.
       Frank lets the Cuban down gently and stands up. Dis-
       gusted with himself. Breathing hard, he leans back
       against the wall. The Cleaning Woman falls to her knees
       and hugs her husband protectively.
                              FRANK
                I'm sorry.
       Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to
       collect himself.
       He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes.
       He looks up and sees a marquee.
       RACHEL MARRON.   TONITE.   BENEFIT CONCERT.    8 P.M.

145A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              145A
       Rachel is seated at her dressing table applying her
       makeup for the evening's performance. The telephone
       RINGS as she begins to work on her hair.
                              RACHEL
                Fletcher?
       No response.
                             RACHEL
                Baby, is that you? It's mommy,
                honey.
                             DAN (V.O.)
                       (eerily distorted)
                Guess again, whore! Fuck you and
                fuck Miami. I'm coming for you.
                I know where you are and I'm
                coming for you...

                                                                   95.


      Rachel is paralyzed by fear, unable to hang up the phone.

146   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              146
      Frank comes in the front door. He's had it. Devaney,
      who has been sitting alone in the living room, stubs out
      a cigarette and stands to meet him. Frank doesn't pause.
                            FRANK
               I'm through. I'll get you back to
               L.A. and that's it. The guy with
               Fletcher can cover you till you get
               a replacement.

                            DEVANEY
               She got another call, while you
               were downstairs and she answered it
               herself. It was him, Frank. Same
               guy.
                            FRANK
                      (moving toward
                       balcony)
               I don't care.
                            DEVANEY
               Farmer, it really shook her up.
               She thought it was going to be
               Fletcher calling her from L.A. I
               think she'll be reasonable now.
                            FRANK
                      (across him)
               Save it, Devaney. The people who
               hire me don't have to be convinced
               to save their own lives.
      Frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony.
                            FRANK
               Call me when she's ready to go
               down.
                             DEVANEY
               Farmer --
      Frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed
      behind him.

147   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       147
      Frank looks out at the ocean. The breeze washes over his
      face. A huge brightly-lit yacht is sailing by, close to
      shore. Frank looks at it reflectively.

                                                              96.


He senses another presence and looks to his right.
Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright  moon-
light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She  is
wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has
been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.   But
tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.   She
holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.  This
is the only time we've seen her smoke.
                      RACHEL
         Farmer... Nothing that's happened
         between us matters... I understand
         now... You're going to have to
         believe me, because I'm not going
         to beg.

She takes a long drag on her cigarette.
                      RACHEL
         It wasn't what he said... it was
         the way he said it... he was so...
Her voice cracks.   She stops and tries to compose herself.
                      RACHEL
         I need you... I'm afraid... and I
         hate it. I hate my fear...
                (a beat)
         Please protect me... Protect
         Fletcher... If anything happened
         to him...
Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate
stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.
                      FRANK
         I can't protect you like this.
         It's impossible. The odds are on
         his side.
                      RACHEL
         I'll do whatever you say.
This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say
that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.
                      FRANK
         I want to take you away for
         a while.
Rachel nods.
                      FRANK
         Somewhere people don't know about.
She nods again, agreeing.

                                                                   97.


                            FRANK
               No Spector or Devaney or Tony.
      He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation.
      There is none.

                            FRANK
               If you cross me up this time, I'll
               kill you myself.
      Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief.

148   EXT. HERB FARMER'S HOUSE (BEND, OREGON) - LAKE SIDE -      148
      DAY

      A large, old, two-story house sits at the top of a slight
      rise, surrounded on three sides by thick, rolling woods.
      Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards
      away is a broad expanse of lawn.  Snow lies on the ground
      and in the trees. At the edge of  the lake, a dock and
      boathouse. An entrance road cuts  out of the trees.
      A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive
      BARKING.
      A van emerges from the trees, tires CRUNCHING through the
      snow.
      Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's
      in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid
      shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.
      The van stops in front of the house. Frank steps out
      from the driver's seat and eyes his dad.
                            FRANK
               Lake's a little low.
                            HERB
               Fill up soon enough when she thaws.
                      (glancing at the van)
               They all in trouble?
                               FRANK
               Just one.

149   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                     149
      Herb squats on the floor with Fletcher. Together, they
      are happily playing around with the fluffy terrier.
      Fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face.
      Henry brings the remaining luggage through. Rachel and
      Nicki stand with Frank near the archway. All eyes are on

                                                                      98.

      Fletcher, Herb and the dog.       Rachel eyes the dog
      skeptically.
                            RACHEL
               That's going to protect us?
                            FRANK
               He's a trained noisemaker.
                               RACHEL
               Terrific.
                            FRANK
               I don't like big dogs. They don't
               know who they're eating.


150   INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                                 150
      Herb stands beside a butcher block, cutting vegetables
      for the evening meal with a practiced hand. Rachel
      watches, drink in hand, looking around the kitchen. It
      has been neatly organized.
                            HERB
               Katherine had this place organized
               just the way she wanted it.
                      (seeing her
                       questioning look)
               Frank's momma.
      There's the COUGH and SPUTTER of an outboard MOTOR from
      outside. Rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees
      Fletcher and Frank in the small skiff by the dock.
      Fletcher tugs again on the starter cord.       At the third
      tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat.
                            RACHEL
               Fletcher doesn't swim well.
                            HERB
               I guess he'd better stay in the
               boat then.
                      (his smile puts
                      her at ease)
               Frank tells me you're a singer.
                            RACHEL
               That's right.
                            HERB
               I'm afraid we're a little out of
               touch here. I'm sorry.
      Rachel waves this off.

                                                                   99.

                            HERB
               You must be very successful to
               need Frank.
      Rachel smiles and looks out of the window.
                            RACHEL
               It's so quiet here.
                            HERB
               Frank came back and stayed six
               months after the Reagan thing.
      Rachel's questioning look encourages Herb.
                            HERB
               Frank wasn't there the day he was
               shot. He never got over that.
                      (a long pause)
               We buried Katherine that day.
      Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.

151   EXT. ON LAKE - SUNSET                                      151
      Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden
      water in the skiff. Fletcher sits at the back, operating
      the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat. He
      wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher
      locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it
      for a laughing moment with a "Look, Mom, no hands"
      gesture.
      Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her
      hair.
      WIDE ON LAKE - DUSK
      CAMERA is DOWN at water level by the lake's edge. In the
      distance, the small boat skims across the surface. A
      light mist is coming up.

152   EXT. BOATHOUSE - DUSK                                      152
      Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night.   It
      is much foggier now and almost dark.
                            FRANK
               I don't want anyone going out in
               it until you've checked it over
               first. Okay? Every time.
      Henry nods.

                                                                   100.

                             HENRY
               Every time.
                             FRANK
               Every time.
      In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached
      the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him
      round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and
      kisses his hair.  After a few moments, Fletcher squirms
      free and runs to catch up with Rachel.

153   INT. HALLWAY - LATER                                       153
      Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family
      photographs. The sounds of dinner being prepared come
      from the kitchen.
      We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank
      as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb;
      Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic
      award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb
      and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced
      to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home
      in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers.
      Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger,
      talking to some female reporters. There standing
      shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman.
      Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is
      in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel
      looks at the two of them for a second.
      Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a
      drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a
      moment as she studies the photo.
      She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for several
      seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.
                            FRANK
                      (inclining his head
                       toward the photo)
               Portman sometimes had trouble
               remembering what his job was.
               Supper's ready.
      We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed
      about her behavior in Miami.

154   INT. DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        154
      The meal has been enthusiastically consumed. Fletcher's
      manhandling a chicken leg, his face covered with crumbs
      and drippings. Rachel shakes her head, laughing.

                                                                 101.


                            HERB
               ... And I never hit him. Ever.
               To this day.
                      (to Frank)
               That's true, isn't it?
                      (to Rachel)
               That's very unusual for my people.
               So what happens? When he's ten
               years old, he complains about it?
               Can you believe that?
                            FRANK
               Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to
               tell her about the time you
               stripped in court.

      Frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen.
                            HERB
                      (to Frank)
               I don't care. I'm proud of that.
                      (to Rachel)
               Anyway, he's ten years old and
               he's just started playing tackle
               football. He comes to me and
               tells me he's afraid of getting
               hit, right? And he thinks it's
               because I never hit him. 'Why don't
               you ever hit me?' he says to me!

155   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    155
      Frank puts down the dishes in the darkened kitchen.
                            FRANK
                      (back over his
                       shoulder)
               If you're lucky, maybe he'll
               tell you about my first jockstrap.
      As he speaks, he peers out through the window at the
      lake. We hear Herb's voice continue from the other room.
                            HERB (O.S.)
               He got over it: Turned into a
               helluva wide receiver. He
               couldn't stand being afraid. When
               he found something that scared
               him, he'd just do it 'til the fear
               went away.

156   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                156

                                                                   102.

                            HERB
               His mother was the same way.
      Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at
      Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows.
      Nicki watches Rachel.


157   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER                                   157
      Herb delicately lifts  a chessboard from the top of a
      cabinet and walks it  over to the table: A half-finished
      game. He leans over   and blows on the pieces -- sending
      a small cloud of dust  into the air.
                            HERB
               Come on, son, you can run but you
               can't hide.
      Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from
      the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. Frank takes
      a place across from his dad by the fire. The others
      gather round.
                              HERB
               Your move.
      Frank studies the board.   Rachel lowers her head into a
      cupped hand, fascinated.
                            RACHEL
               How long has this game been going
               on?
      Frank picks up a knight, thinks, sets it back down.
                              FRANK
               Three years.
      Nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it
      beside Fletcher. Fletcher peers intently at the board
      as he chews on a handful.
                            HERB
               He had me on the run there that
               first year.
      Frank picks up his rook, scratches his forehead with it.
      He turns to Fletcher.
                            FRANK
               What do you think?
      Fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn, wipes his mouth.
                            FLETCHER
               Knight to king-four.

                                                                   103.


      Frank, Herbert and Rachel turn in synch and stare at the
      boy.
                            FRANK
               City kid.

      Herb pats his leg, gesturing to Fletcher to take a place
      on his lap.
                            HERB
               Come over here, Fletcher, sit by
               me.
      Fletcher goes over and joins him.

                            RACHEL
               Well, that's it for me, I'm
               going to bed.
      She rises. Frank follows her up the stairs.   Nicki
      watches them go.

158   INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT                                 158
      Frank stops at the end of the hallway, checking the lock
      on the window, the little terrier is at his heels.
      Rachel pauses outside the door. Frank gestures for the
      dog to stay. The dog sits in the middle of the hallway
      looking from one to the other. For a few seconds neither
      speaks.
      Frank smiles.
                            FRANK
               Good night, Rachel.
      Rachel accepts this. She smiles in return and touches
      him on the arm, very tenderly.
                            RACHEL
               Good night, Frank.
      Rachel turns, goes to her room and closes the door.

159   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  159
      Details are barely distinguishable in the fog. We hear
      the gentle LAPPING of the LAKEWATER against the dock.

160   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   160
      Fletcher is asleep, snuggled on Herb's lap by the fire.
      Herb is also asleep. Frank fetches a blanket and gently

                                                                104.

      covers them both.    He puts out the light.

161   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                              161
      Frank steps quietly into the hall. Nicki is standing
      in the shadows. She watches as Frank goes through the
      ritual of locking the front door, several ways.
                            NICKI
                      (softly)
               You're very thorough.
      VARIOUS SHOTS - AROUND INTERIOR
      Frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first
      floor, checking windows and doors. Nicki tags along.
                            NICKI
               What's happening between you
               and Rachel?
      Frank glances at her.
                            NICKI
               Come on. One minute she's got
               magnetic hands, the next she hates
               you. I can't figure out what it
               is now.
                            FRANK
               You follow all her moves this
               closely?
                            NICKI
                      (smiling)
               It's a living.
                            FRANK
               No, it isn't.
      He moves away into the next room.    She hesitates a
      moment, then follows.
                            NICKI
               You think my life is pretty
               sickly, don't you?
                              FRANK
               No.
                              NICKI
               You must.    I do.
      Frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove,
      checks the windows.

                                                             105.

                      FRANK
         Why don't you change it?
                      NICKI
         Is it that easy?
Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit.
She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his
shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other.
                      FRANK
         You're a lovely woman.
                      NICKI
         But you don't want me.

Frank's look affirms it.    Nicki is embarrassed, angry.
                      NICKI
         I'm surprised. Thorough fellow
         like you. Why stop at one sister
         when you can fuck them both?
                      FRANK
         I make my mistakes.
                      NICKI
         But you didn't say no to the boss.
She starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her
now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away.
Their faces are very close.    It is tight and near here.
                      FRANK
                (with force)
         No, don't go away, Nicki. Don't
         leave me with that. Tell me about
         it. Tell me how long you've been
         second. Tell me how she has a
         child and you don't. Tell me
         something. But don't turn away
         and try to stick it on me.
Nicki twists in his grip.    He holds her tight.
                      NICKI
         I don't need this from you.
                      FRANK
         Maybe I need it.     I'm fed up with
         people telling me    they have no
         control over their    lives. If you
         hate your life so    much, turn it
         around.

                                                                     106.

                             NICKI
                It's not so simple.
                             FRANK
                Yes it is. You can walk out that
                fucking door anytime you want.
                I'll unlock it for you.

       Nicki looks up into his face.    Tears start in her eyes.
                               NICKI
                Let me go.
       He releases her, looks at her.
                                FRANK
                Okay.     It's not my business.
       He moves away, OUT OF FRAME.    We HOLD ON Nicki, a long
       time.

162    EXT. LAKE - DAY                                             162
       Bright sun. Frank and his father walk along the lake
       shoreline, stooping here and there to finger animal
       prints in the snow and mud.
                             FRANK
                Raccoon... deer...?
       Herb nods.
       Their attention is drawn to soft singing up by the house.

162A   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162A
       Nicki absently sings an old gospel tune as she tosses
       breakfast scraps to a group of hungry ducks gathered by
       the porch.

162B   EXT. LAKE - DAY                                             162B
                             HERB
                I've never heard church music in
                the middle of the week before.

162C   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162C
       Nicki's soft voice is joined by Rachel's strong harmony,
       and the two men watch as Rachel comes out to join her
       sister on the porch, startling Nicki. Both sing for a
       moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel
       gives her a hug.

                                                                    107.


162D   EXT. LAKE - DAY                                            162D
       Herb and Frank are about to return to the house. They
       stop short. There, at their feet, is a line of human
       foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into
       the trees. Frank looks at Herb, suddenly alert.

                              FRANK
                 Where's Fletcher?
       Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a
       fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound
       of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's
       head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance,
       looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank.

                             HENRY
                       (shouting)
                 Frank! I haven't...
       But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch
       and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse
       and dock.
       Rachel turns to look.
       The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the
       motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly
       away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock.
       Frank is running toward the water with everything he's
       got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD
       drowns out his voice as he yells.
                               FRANK
                 Fletcher!   Fletcher!
       IN BOAT
       Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees
       Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is
       approaching the end of the dock.
       DOCK
       Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to
       sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards
       as he runs.
       IN BOAT
       Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the
       throttle a little twist.
       DOCK

                                                             108.

Frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives
directly at the rear of the moving boat. Frank's body
flies out over the boat. He knocks Fletcher out of his
seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.
                         RACHEL
                   (screams)
           No!   He can't swim!
IN WATER
Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.
Fletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him toward
the dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out
toward the center of the lake.

DOCK
Henry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock. Nicki
and Herb are running toward    it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.
Henry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce
innocently across the water,    defining a broad curve.
                        RACHEL
           Fletcher, baby. Are you all
           right? Baby.
Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank.
Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check
he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.
                        HERB
           He's all right.
Henry helps Frank up out of the water.    Frank sits on
the end of the dock, breathing hard.
                        RACHEL
           What are you doing? You out of
           your mind? You're crazy!
                  (to Fletcher)
           You're all right, baby.
                  (back to Frank)
           You could have drowned him!
Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come
to a stop out in the middle of the lake.
                         FRANK
           I'm sorry.   I got careless.
Henry looks at Frank.    He feels terrible about not
checking the boat.
                        HENRY
           Frank, I'm sorry. I should have...

                                                                     109.

                             HERB
                It's okay, Henry.
       Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head.
                             HERB
                You all right now, son?

       Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.   Frank begins
       to stand up.
                             HENRY
                How do we get the boat back?
       Out in the center of the lake, the BOAT BLOWS UP.    Every-
       one on the dock jumps.

       Nicki screams.
       Frank sits down again. He shakes his head. On an
       impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward.   It's
       trembling slightly.

162E   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                          162E
       Rachel and Nicki hurriedly pack their bags.   Fletcher
       hovers nearby.

162F   EXT. SHED/GARAGE - DAY
       162F
       Frank slides out from under the van. The hood is up.
       Henry stands nearby. Frank goes to the driver's seat.
                             FRANK
                       (to Henry)
                Back off.
       Henry moves away from the van.   Frank inserts the key in
       the ignition.

162G   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162G
       Herb comes out of the house, fast. His eyes scan the
       woods as he heads towards the shed.
                                HERB
                Frank!
       Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away.

162H   INT. VAN - DAY                                              162H

                                                                        110.

        Frank takes a moment, then turns the key.    Nothing.   The
        van is dead.

162-I   EXT. LAWN - DAY                                               162-I
        Henry and Herb watch.    Frank gets out of the van.   He
        walks to Herb.
                              HERB
                 Someone's cut the phone lines. It
                 could be anywhere between here and
                 town.
                              FRANK
                 Both the cars are dead. And I
                 can't see how it was done.
        Frank and Herb exchange a look.
                              FRANK
                 Who could know we're here? This
                 place has nothing to do with her.
                              HERB
                 Maybe it has to do with you.
        Frank looks at him.
                              HERB
                 We can't walk out of here at
                 night with them.
        Frank shakes his head.
                              FRANK
                 We'll button down tonight and
                 walk out at first light.

162J    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                     162J
        There is a light ground-mist. The moon shines down
        down brightly but the house is totally dark.

162K    INT. HOUSE - MONTAGE - NIGHT                                  162K
        The terrier dog listens in the upstairs hallway. Herb
        watches from an upstairs window. Rachel lies in bed,
        clutching Fletcher tightly.

164     INT. LIVING ROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT                            164
        Frank has been sitting in a chair in the center of the
        living room for two hours. Listening. Now we listen

                                                                   111.

      with him. At first it seems silent, but slowly we become
      aware of a subtle symphony of sounds. An old house sur-
      rounded by WOODS. There are lots of NOISES. But they
      are regular, innocent.
      Frank is aware of a new noise, a gentle sobbing coming
      from nearby. He picks up his gun from the table beside
      him and goes into the kitchen.

166   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       166
      Nicki is sitting with her head in her hands at the kitchen
      table, sobbing. There's a nearly empty bottle beside
      her. Frank is instantly on the alert but makes no sign.

                            NICKI
                      (crying)
               I was an idiot last night.
      There is a long pause.
                            NICKI
               What do you think about today?
                            FRANK
                      (gently)
               I think this is no maniac.   He
               knows what he's doing.
      There is a long, long silence.   Nicki continues crying.
      Finally --
                            NICKI
               You're right. He does.
                            FRANK
               Tell me about it.
      She doesn't reply.
                            FRANK
               Who is it, Nicki?
                            NICKI
               He almost got Fletcher today...
                            FRANK
               How do we stop him?
                            NICKI
               ...my darling Fletcher...
                               FRANK
               Who is it?
                               NICKI

                                                           112.

         I don't know.   I don't know.
Frank goes to her, treats her gently, like a doctor.
                      FRANK
         You can call him off.

                      NICKI
                (shaking her head)
         He doesn't even know who hired him.
         He doesn't know who I am and I
         don't know who he is.
                      FRANK
         How'd you do it?

She seems on the edge of hysteria. Frank takes her face
in his hands, strokes her hair, brings her back from the
brink.
                      FRANK
         How?
                      NICKI
         ...I went to a bar in East L.A. I
         asked around... I talked to a
         man...
                      FRANK
         Name?
                      NICKI
                (vague)
         ...Armando... He arranged it.
         That's all I know...
                      FRANK
         Is it all paid for?
                      NICKI
                (nods)
         ... and then some... Till it's done.
                      FRANK
         He keeps going until he kills her?
Nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.
                      FRANK
         What's the name of the bar?
                      NICKI
         I'm not sure... I was very stoned.
                      FRANK
         How 'bout the letters?

                                                                  113.


                            NICKI
                      (desperately)
               No, no. You don't understand.
               The letters came first. I don't
               know who's sending them... but
               they're reading my mind... Those
               were my thoughts. I hate her. It
               made me think I could do it... But
               I could never hurt Fletcher.
               Never.
                      (begging him)
               You've got to stop it!
                            FRANK
               We will. You and me. Tomorrow
               we're going back to L.A. We're
               going to find the bar, we're going
               to find Armando.
      He starts to rise.    She stops him.
                            NICKI
               Don't you even want to know why?
                               FRANK
               You told me.     She has everything.
      Frank stands up and begins to move across the room. Nicki
      puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment.
      Suddenly, Frank freezes, listening.
                            NICKI
               What if we can't --
      Frank motions her into silence. We strain to hear what
      Frank hears. Silently, Frank goes to the door, crouch
      ing. He listens. There again is a DISTANT GROWL from
      the DOG upstairs.
      Frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to Nicki.
                              FRANK
               Stay here.    Don't move.
      Nicki's face shows true terror.
      Frank is out the door.

168   INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                      168
      Frank runs up them fast.    Two at a time.

169   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           169

                                                                      114.

       Frank travels close to the wall, very quickly. He stops,
       listens. The TERRIER looks at Frank but still GROWLS.
       Frank throws open Rachel's door. Rachel gasps in
       surprise and clutches at Fletcher. Frank hears a noise
       behind him, whirls round him and drops to a knee, weapon
       ready to fire!

       It's Herb, stepping out of his room, carrying a police-
       issue pistol.
                             HERB
                It's me!
       Rachel's voice comes from her room.
                             RACHEL (O.S.)
                What's happening?
       The terrier suddenly starts barking loudly.

171    INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - POV - MOVING SHOT - NIGHT         171
       We're in someone's POV moving along the hallway. Nicki
       steps out of the kitchen a few feet ahead and looks in
       terror toward the CAMERA.
                             NICKI (O.S.)
                No, no... stop... I'm the one
                who...

172    INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172
       Frank and Herb spin around.    Rachel calls from her room.
                             RACHEL
                Frank?

172A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                             172A
       A GUNSHOT BLASTS Nicki against the wall, her hand still
       delicately raised in a classic gesture of restraint.

172B   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172B
       Frank's head spins to Rachel's doorway, then immediately
       back to Herb. He starts to move towards the stairs,
       fast.
                             FRANK
                       (to Herb)
                Stay with Rachel!
       Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room.

                                                                    115.



173    INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                        173
       Frank is rapidly down the stairs, gun in hand.


173A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                           173A
       Frank finds Nicki's body slumped against the wall.   He
       checks her. She's dead. The door beyond is open.     The
       wind blows in. Outside it's foggy.
                             FRANK
                       (yelling)
                Dad?

                              HERB (O.S.)
                We're okay!
                             FRANK
                Stay with Rachel!
       The DOG continues to BARK upstairs. Frank sees a slight
       movement outside and window to his right. A split-second
       moment of decision. He heads off rapidly down the hall,
       away from the open door.

175    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175
       The fog is thick. Frank swiftly emerges from the back
       door and stops, dead still, listening. There is only the
       RUSTLING of TREES.

175A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              175A
       Herb is by Rachel's bed.
                             RACHEL
                What's happening? Where's Nicki?
                              HERB
                Be quiet!

175B   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175B
       Frank listens. Suddenly he hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, a
       body breaking through the bushes. Frank heads off
       towards the sound at a run.

176    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176
       INTERCUT - FRANK AND FIGURE

                                                                    116.


       The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene.
       In and out of the fog. Stop, listen,  wait, go. Two
       wary, interchangeable animals. Frank  disappears into
       the fog. When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving
       faster, closing the gap.

       The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear-
       ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of
       the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He
       hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the
       direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE.
       Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he
       hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up
       ahead. Close.

       The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready,
       confident. He waits. Nothing.
       Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He
       raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready
       to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something
       really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we
       hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun
       15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS.
       The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered
       six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind
       his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in
       the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER
       SHOT from Frank very close to the man.

176A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              176A
       Herb is at the window. There is anguish on his face as
       he hears the SHOTS. He wants to go to his son's aid but
       knows he cannot leave Rachel.
       Rachel and Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified.
       Fletcher clutches at the DOG, which is still BARKING.
       Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand.

176B   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176B
       Frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the
       splintered tree. We STAY WITH him and hear the ENGINE
       of a CAR ROAR to life and TIRES PEEL OUT of the dirt.
       Frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red
       lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a
       bend. He EMPTIES his GUN at it. We hear GLASS
       SHATTERING, but the car keeps going.

176C   INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING            176C

                                                                  117.


       Snow is falling. In the b.g. we see the flashing
       lights of a police car. Frank is on the phone to
       Minella.
                             MINELLA (V.O.)
                But, Frank, this doesn't make
                sense...
                             FRANK
                What do you mean?
                             MINELLA (V.O.)
                We already got him.
                              FRANK
                What?   Where?

179    INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS (LOS ANGELES) - EARLY MORNING   179
       Minella is talking with Frank on the phone. He's looking
       into an observation room through a one-way window.
                             MINELLA
                Here, last night. You should see
                his locker, Frank. The guy's
                obsessed with Rachel Marron...
                             FRANK
                You're sure it's him?
                             MINELLA
                Forensics say it's 100 percent
                positive I.D... And he's got a
                black Toyota 4 x 4. Ray's with
                him now.
       MINELLA'S POV
       Sitting in the observation room at a table talking to
       Ray Court is Dan. He looks frightened and confused.

179A   INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING          179A
                             FRANK
                Well, whoever you got down there
                wasn't here last night. This was
                a professional...
                             MINELLA (V.O.)
                This is crazy... What do you want
                to do, Frank?
                             FRANK
                How long can you keep him?

                                                                   118.


                            MINELLA (V.O.)
               Well technically all he's done is
               write some letters. 48 hours
               maximum. You know the deal.


181   EXT. MARRON MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DAY                       181
      Rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding
      drive, followed by a black Mercedes limousine. Behind
      the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent
      gathered outside, held back by a large number of police
      and security guards. A light drizzle is falling.
      The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel
      of Rachel's. Frank gets out of the front and opens the
      back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher
      out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few
      other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes.
      Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm
      and goes inside. She does not look at Frank.

182   INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                                   182
      A hand takes a pitcher of orange juice from the refriger-
      ator and pours some into a large glass. They uncap a
      bottle of vodka and pour a huge portion into the orange
      juice.

183   INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                                   183
      It has grown very dark in the family room. Frank is
      sitting all alone, perfectly still, in one of the over-
      stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to him.
      He stares off into space. A small voice comes out of
      the darkness.
                            FLETCHER
               You okay, Frank?
      Frank acknowledges Fletcher's small presence standing
      to the side of the big chair. He doesn't look at him
      directly.
                            FRANK
               Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.     How
               'bout you?
                            FLETCHER
               I couldn't sleep... It was so
               scary, just thinking about it...
      He looks at Frank.

                                                                    119.


                            FLETCHER
               Do you feel scared, Frank?
                            FRANK
               Yeah, Fletcher, I do.

      Frank puts his hand gently on Fletcher's head, but he
      does not look at him.
                            FRANK
               Everybody's afraid of something,
               Flethcer. That's how we know we
               care about something, when we're
               afraid we'll lose it.

                            FLETCHER
               What are you afraid of?
                            FRANK
               I think you should try to go back
               to sleep now, pal.
                            FLETCHER
               Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the
               man who killed Nicki? Are you
               afraid of him?
      Finally, Frank turns and looks at Fletcher.    Frank is
      pretty far gone. He shakes his head "no."     He realizes
      that that kind of fear had never occurred to   him, and
      recognizing that fact sets him back into his   thoughts.
                              FLETCHER
               Then what?    What are you afraid
               of?
      Frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore.    He lets
      his hand drop away from Fletcher.
                            FRANK
               I'm afraid... of not being there...
      Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending.
                            FRANK
               It's late. Do you want me to take
               you back to your room?
      Fletcher shakes his head "no," just barely.    Then he
      disappears.

185   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        185
      Frank, silhouetted, moves toward the stairway to the main
      level. There is light up there.

                                                                  120.



186   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                    186
      Frank begins climbing the stairs. When he has gone a
      quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and
      begins walking down.

      At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she
      hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and
      try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the
      same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already
      emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank
      hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows
      knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against
      the wall. He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt
      to protect himself from the onslaught. She cries as she
      hits him.
                            RACHEL
                      (hysterical)
               You, you, you... You brought this
               pain into my house... Now you're
               here! Where were you then? Why
               didn't you save her? It was your
               job to protect me and she died
               doing it... It was me they were
               after. And you let them kill her!
                      (she gasps for air)
               She never did anything to anyone.
      As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her
      blows become sloppy, weak. She sinks to the steps,
      sitting on them, sobbing.
                            RACHEL
               She never hurt anyone. She was
               good.
                      (she looks at him;
                       entreats him)
               You saw her. She never wished
               anyone any harm. Did she? Did
               she?
      Frank looks at her, shakes his head "no." Rachel puts
      her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments;
      her crying slows.
                            RACHEL
                      (finally, quietly)
               She never hurt a soul.
                      (long pause)
               ... I didn't love her well enough.
               I didn't take care of her...
                      (a beat)
               ... She gave me only love.

                                                                     121.

       She sits quietly on the steps in the gloom. Frank watches
       for a long moment, then softly continues on his way.

186A   EXT. POOL AREA - MARRON ESTATE - DAY                      186A
       It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in
       the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits
       patiently at the side, towels at the ready.
       At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought,
       mourning her sister.
       At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too,
       is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears
       some of the responsibility.

       The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue.

187    EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT           187
       The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi-
       nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station.
       Inside, the T.V. screens flicker and glow.
       Perched on the top of a slight   hill, Frank sits alone and
       motionless under a big tree.    He gazes down at the gate-
       house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps.
       All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and
       tranquil in the moonlight.
       After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap-
       proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel.
                             RACHEL
                I guess you've heard what's
                happening.
       Frank nods.
                             RACHEL
                Mind if I sit down?
       Frank shakes his head. They sit side by side for awhile,
       both lost in thought. Rachel seems very calm.
                             RACHEL
                It isn't over yet, is it?
       Frank shakes his head.
                             FRANK
                He knows he still hasn't got you.
                             RACHEL
                So he'll come again?

                                                          122.


                      FRANK
         It's possible.
                       RACHEL
         The Oscars?

                       FRANK
         Maybe.
Rachel takes this philosophically.     She tugs at the
grass, thinking.
                      RACHEL
         When I was back in Squirrel Hill,
         I started betting my friends
         fifty bucks each that someday I'd
         win an Oscar. You can understand
         how important it is that they see
         me up there if I win.
She looks at him and smiles.
                      RACHEL
         If everyone of those pikers comes
         through, it could add up to a lot
         of money.
                      FRANK
         I think it's very dangerous.
                      RACHEL
         I know. But I can't stay up here
         on my hill forever.
They are silent for awhile.     Rachel lies back on the
grass, stares at the sky.
                      RACHEL
         I didn't get to this place in my
         life by doing the smart thing
         every time.
                (as Frank nods)
         How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out
         there on the edge... did you ever
         do something that didn't make too
         much sense, except maybe inside
         you? In your stomach somewhere?
         Something that wasn't smart?
                (looks at him)
         I'll bet you have plenty. I'll
         bet you do. Nobody gets really
         good without it. And you're good.
         I know that.
She sits up beside him.

                                                                       123.


                            RACHEL
               I don't know why all this has
               happened to me...
                      (a beat)
               ... but I do know that none of
               it's your fault. I hope you can
               hear me, because this is how I say
               I'm sorry.
      Frank accepts.
                            RACHEL
                      (relieved)
               So... I'm going to go see if I win
               an Oscar. And I won't worry about
               it at all. Because I've got you
               to protect me.
      Frank almost smiles.
                            FRANK
               That's right.
      He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms.
      He kisses her and lays her down. His body moves over
      hers. Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night.

188   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                           188
      The chaos and razamatazz of Oscar night.   Crowds, limos,
      cameras, searchlights...

189   INT. RACHEL'S LIMO - FRONT OF THE PANTAGES - NIGHT          189
      The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red-
      carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre.
      Frank and Tony sit in front with Henry. In the back a
      spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and
      Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos.     Up
      ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV
      cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two
      bleachers full of fans. The glare from the arc lights
      is almost blinding.
                            DEVANEY
               We'll go straight back to the
               Green Room. Right, Frank?
      Frank nods.
                            DEVANEY
               Got that, Tony?

                                                                  124.


                            FRANK
               Tony knows what he's doing.
      Tony looks at Frank, surprised and not a little pleased
      with the unexpected support.

                            RACHEL
               I wish you boys would relax a
               little. Nothing bad's gonna
               happen out there, alright?
                      (the old Rachel)
               Unless I lose the fucking award.
      She looks around at the men, all are tense.

                            RACHEL
               Jesus, what a crew.
      Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the
      panel in front of her and checks her appearance. The
      limo moves up.
                            RACHEL
               Screw it. I'm through worrying.
               When your number's up, it's up.
               Right, Farmer?
      The limo is almost at the red carpet.   Frank slips out
      the front door of the moving limo.

190   EXT. LIMO - NIGHT                                         190
      More quartz lights click on.
      The TV cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank
      steps out of the way.
      FRANK'S POV
      as he surveys the busy scene. A microphoned M.C. peers
      into Rachel's limo and walks toward it.
                            M.C.
               ... Miss Rachel Marron!
      ON TV CAMERA MONITOR we see Rachel wave to the crowd.
                            M.C.
               Everyone wishes you the best
               tonight, Rachel.
      Frank leads the small procession down the red carpet.
      Fans reach out asking for his autograph.
      FRANK'S POV

                                                                 125.


      as his glance darts around: high into the bleachers,
      ahead in the distance, to the door, to the side at
      photographers nodding to the massed security men with
      their walkie-talkies.
      Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional.
      Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained.
      As they enter, a WIDE SHOT from across the street shows
      their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up. The
      CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS to reveal the rear fender of a
      Toyota 4X4 parked in the foreground.

191   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                      191

      It is large and has been fitted with a bar and buffet.
      Formally-dressed presenters and hosts mill about, laugh-
      ing and talking. Many greet Rachel.
      A TV monitor hangs from the ceiling in one corner. On
      it, the Academy Awards continue. An elaborate dance
      number is just concluding. The audience applauds.
      Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second
      hand.
      A harried associate producer SKIP THOMAS, comes up to
      Rachel, settled in an armchair. Tony stands nearby,
      Frank leans against a far wall.
                            SKIP
               Hello, Rachel. I need to get you
               straight on your responsibilities.
                             RACHEL
               Sure, Skip.
      Skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand
      and gives it to Rachel. He consults a clipboard as he
      speaks. There, laid out minute by minute, is the order
      of the evening's events. Each one has a precise time
      printed beside it, including those that involve Rachel.
                            SKIP
               Now, it's Best Sound, then another
               song, then you. At precisely
               (looks at his clipboard) -- 8:07,
               you'll be presenting with Clive
               Healy. Those are your lines. The
               prompter's straight ahead and --
               we pray -- working perfectly.
      Rachel nods.
                             RACHEL

                                                                  126.

                  Fine, you'll be a big shot
                  someday, Skip.
      Skip smiles and walks off, glancing up at the clock.
      7:43. CLIVE HEALY, a slim British actor appears, bows
      and kisses Rachel's hand.

                               CLIVE
                  I understand it's my great honor
                  to escort you onstage.
                               RACHEL
                  That's right, Clive. And I don't
                  like it one bit that you look
                  skinnier than me.

      TV MONITOR - The show is progressing, flashing out across
      the world.

                  I'd like to thank our wonderful
                  sound crew for all the evenings
                  and weekends they sacrificed, the

192   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                       192
      The celebrities in the Green Room drink, eat and talk.
      Rachel is deep in a giggling, girlish conversation with
      another actress. Skip Thomas approaches Rachel again.
                              SKIP

                                                                        127.

                  Rachel.    One more song, then you.
      Rachel nods, goes back to her conversation.       Frank steps
      up to Tony.
                               FRANK
                  I'm going to have a look around.
                  I'll come back for her. Stay
                  alert.
      Tony nods, watches Frank go.

193   INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT                                     193
      Frank moves down the hall from the Green Room toward the
      stage. Stagehands, technicians, performers speak in
      hushed tones. TV monitors are mounted throughout the
      area. On screen a distinguished-looking actor named
      REARDON is serving as temporary master of ceremonies.
      Frank walks along, checking the route, looking up into
      the flies. He rounds a corner and is face to face with
      Portman.
                                FRANK
                  Portman.   What are you doing here?
                               PORTMAN
                  I'm on the job.
                                FRANK
                  Who?
                                PORTMAN
                  Him.
      Portman points at a nearby TV monitor.      On screen,
      Reardon is introducing the next song.
                               REARDON (V.O.)
                         (on TV screen)
                  My mother has always thought I was
                  the star of every movie I've been
                  in. You remember 'Night Of The
                  Stranger'?
      Applause.
                               REARDON (V.O.)
                  You probably don't remember me in
                  that. My mother can tell you
                  about it. To this day, she thinks
                  it's about a desk clerk at the
                  hotel where what's-his-name is
                  hiding out from the cops.

                                                                     128.

      Laughter.
                               REARDON (V.O.)
                  Now it's time to hear the final
                  nominated song, from the film
                  'Queen Of The Night' -- 'I Have
                  Nothing.' And here to sing it for
                  us, the multi-talented Miss Sandra
                  Castle!
                               PORTMAN (O.S.)
                         (during the above)
                  Short-term gig... but quite
                  profitable... Listen, Frank, I'm
                  sorry about Miami. You know,
                  nothing really happened... I felt
                  bad for you... I wanted to say
                  something, but you disappeared...
      (NOTE: "I Have Nothing" fanfare. Dancers onto stage.
      First section of song, commencing with shortened chorus
      then first verse (Total 1 Minute)
      Reardon walks off the stage ten feet from where Frank and
      Portman are standing, glances at them and moves off down
      the hall.
                               PORTMAN
                  Back to work. I'll probably see
                  you at the Governor's Ball.
      Portman walks off after Reardon.    Frank watches him,
      thoughtful.
      ON TV MONITOR - Sandra Castle sings "I Have Nothing" with
      great feeling. The lyrics recall the text of the death
      threat.

      She is at a makeup table. MUSIC is LOUD.
      The celebrities in the Green Room are impressed with
      Sandra's performance. There is spontaneous applause.
      Rachel turns to the room.

                  I want that broad run out of town.

                 Tony, you there?

                              TONY
                        (O.S.)
                 Yeah, Frank.
                              FRANK
                 Tony, I've got a feeling this is
                 the night. I think he's gonna go
                 for her in front of all the
                 cameras. The kind of thing only a
                 lunatic would do. That's how he
                 wants it to look. Except he isn't
                 a lunatic. He's very clever. I
                 need you to help me.
                              TONY
                        (O.S.)
                 I'm with you, Frank.
       There's no more competition between them.
       Three sound technicians appear at Frank's side, very
       agitated.
                              TECHNICIAN
                        (to Frank)
                 You can't use that thing back
                 here. The  breakthrough's killing
                 our radio mikes... We'll have to
                 disconnect you.

      Frank walks past Tony. Tony holds up the earpiece in
      frustration. Frank nods. He walks over to Rachel. He
      seems tense and she senses it. And like a tangible
      thing, his anxiety is passed over to her. She is
      frightened.
                            RACHEL
                      (spooked)
               What's wrong?
      Skip Thomas appears at her side.

               Rachel... Clive. Let's go, okay?
      Clive Healy comes over. Rachel must tear her eyes away
      from Frank. Tony floats up behind them. Skip regards
      him with irritation and turns to Frank.

               Tony stays.
      Skip looks at Rachel for a response.
                              RACHEL
               Yes!    I want him.
      Skip shrugs.    Clive takes Rachel's arm.
                            CLIVE
               Come, Rachel, let us brighten the
               firmament.
      Rachel forces a smile, but her eyes follow Frank as he
      starts to lead the way out of the Green Room. On an
      impulse, she reaches for something from the makeup table
      and presses it into her hand. It's the Russian Orthodox
      cross. She clutches it like a talisman and follows
      Frank. Tony brings up the rear.

197   INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT                                197
      The group moves down the hall from the Green Room, past
      the stage right wings. Behind the scenery to the back
      of the stage.

in blue, celebrity guests, technicians. His eyes examine
each curtain, corner and recess. He looks above him.
CLOSEUP ON RACHEL'S FACE as she looks around nervously.
HER BODY

is tense on Clive's arm.   Clive pats her arm soothingly.
                        CLIVE
           Try to relax, Rachel. I know
           you must be very excited.
Skip leads them to a set of temporary stairs behind the
scenery; they lead to the center of the top tier.
Production aides with clipboards and headphones wait up
there.
THE CLOCK - 8:05
                        SKIP
                  (pointing)
           Rachel, you'll go in there and
           Clive, you over there. You'll
           meet on the landing.
They both nod, but Rachel is distracted, tense.
                        SKIP
           Watch your step going down.
           Someone spilled some water.
Clive and Rachel climb the stairs. Rachel turns once
more to look anxiously at Frank. She clutches the cross
but he doesn't see.
Frank watches them ascend. He signals Tony to stay
there until Rachel goes on. Frank moves off toward the
stage left wings.
ON TV MONITOR - we see Reardon, acting as Master of
Ceremonies, doing the introductions.
                        REARDON (V.O.)
                  (on screen)
           I used to have an outfit just like
           that... And to present the Best
           Song award we have our debonair
           friend from England and the lady
           who has everything -- Clive
           Healy and Rachel Marron!
A red camera light clicks on.
MUSIC UP, APPLAUSE, as we see Clive and Rachel make their
entrances on the TV monitor.

                                                                    132.


198   INT. STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                           198
      Frank swiftly adjusts his position so he can still see
      the stage. As he does, he glances under the scaffolding
      that supports the set.


199   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                       199
      Rachel and Clive reach the podium. Clive is all smiles.
      Rachel is trying, but is obviously distracted.
      FROM BEHIND THEM
      As the applause dies away, we see  what they see: TV
      cameras, an orchestra in the pit,  the huge audience, and
      the bright glare of the lights.   At the front of the
      podium is the transparent plastic  of the teleprompter;
      their lines can be clearly seen,  printed out and moving
      vertically.
                            CLIVE
                      (reading from the
                       prompter)
               Well, Rachel, I know that you only
               came tonight to present this award
               and you'll want to leave as soon
               as we're done.
      Rachel's lines appear on the prompter, but she does not
      start reading them immediately. They stop moving on the
      screen. Rachel's face, her eyes darting about. There
      is an awful silence.

      RACHEL'S POV - BRIGHT RED LIGHT
      on the nearest TV camera. The teleprompter, now showing
      Clive's lines. The light. A man in the first row of
      the audience.
      CLOSE ON HER HANDS as they squeeze the cross.
                            CLIVE (O.S.)
               Over the course of the evening
               we've heard five smashing songs
               and the names of the artists who
               created them.

200   INT. STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                           200
      Frank, watching Rachel, hears the barely audible CLICKING
      start from the tiny receiver on his belt. He's puzzled.
      His eyes dart to Rachel's hand and he sees the cross.
      He knows what she's going through. Her hand is shaking

                                                                    133.

      badly.

201   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                       201
      She sways. Clive supports her as discreetly as he can,
      smiling out at the audience.

      FROM BEHIND Clive and Rachel, we watch as Clive picks up
      Rachel's lines from the prompter, AD LIBBING to make them
      fit.
                              CLIVE
                 And I know that no matter what
                 anyone thinks, you have no
                 personal favorites.

      Thin laughter. The audience is starting to sense that
      something is wrong with Rachel.
                              CLIVE
                 The Best Song nominees are:

                                                  QUICK CUT TO:
      RACHEL'S POV
      An usher near the wall shifts his weight. The orchestra
      conductor turns to look at her. A musician turns his
      sheet music. The dark at the back of the balcony. The
      teleprompter.
      CLOSE ON FRANK
      as he alone hears the CLICKING -- monitors her distress
      and fear.
      ON STAGE
                              RACHEL
                        (blurting her
                         prompter lines)
                 All right, Clive, let's find
                 out --

                                                                       134.

      The teleprompter operator has been thrown off and now
      takes a moment to get it moving again.
                               RACHEL
                         (reading)
                  -- let's find out who the winner
                  is.

                  The envelope. Rachel, shall I do
                  the honors?
      INTERCUT --
      RACHEL'S POV - CLIVE'S HANDS

      work at the envelope, tearing, freeing the flap.       His
      fingers work to pull out the contents.
      RACHEL'S FACE
      watching. The CLICKING is almost deafening -- like a
      heartbeat.
      THE CLOCK
      The second hand ticks in enormous CLOSEUP.       It's 8:07.

202   INSERT - (BLEACHED OUT) ENORMOUS CLOSEUP - MAN'S FINGER        202
      on a trigger.

203   INSERT - (BLEACHED OUT) ENORMOUS CLOSEUP - A BULLET            203
      drifts lazily towards us out of the muzzle of a gun in
      ultra SLOW MOTION.

204   INSERT - (BLEACHED OUT) - HANDS                                204
      bring out one of the pasted-up death threats with the
      familiar opening lines -- 'MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE
      EVERYTHING. I HAVE NOTHING.'
      CLOSE
      as Clive pulls the card out of the envelope.       It reads:
                           "I HAVE NOTHING"
                              Music by
      Rachel gasps, stifles a scream.
                               CLIVE
                  And the winner is "I Have Nothing"

                                                                         135.

                  from 'Queen Of The Night' music
                  and lyrics by Nancy Garbor.
      Rachel loses control, backs away from the podium and runs
      off stage right. The audience applauds the winner.
                               NANCY GARBOR
                  This is so exciting. I can't
                  begin to describe what it feels
                  like to stand here -- with this!
      APPLAUSE.
                               NANCY GARBOR
                  First, I want to thank Rachel
                  Marron. Without her support,
                  encouragement and determination
                  to help get an unknown songwriter
                  heard, I wouldn't be standing here.
                  A lot of people talk about how
                  they're going to help others once
                  they make it themselves, but Rachel
                  really follows through. I'd also
                  like to thank Helen Pollak, a
                  wonderful producer, who never got
                  fed up with me.

205   INT. OFF STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                    205
      Frank sees Rachel run off the opposite side of the stage
      and heads over there, around the back of the scenery.

206   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                          206
      Clive, the professional, stands holding the envelope.         He
      glances off after Rachel, mystified.

207   INT. STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                                 207
      A cluster of people   surround Rachel, comforting her.
      Frank comes up. He    does not try to force his way through
      to Rachel. People    begin to move away, the cluster thins.
      Two stars move off   toward the back of the stage.
                               STAR #1
                  I always said she was nuts.    I've
                  always said that.
      Clive Healy comes up.
                               CLIVE
                  Is she all right?
      He is assured that she is.       Clive goes out to his seat

                                                               136.

in the audience. As the people move off, Rachel becomes
clearly visible to Frank. Tony is standing next to her,
but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her.
Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a
handkerchief. She is recovering fast. Past her fear,
she is now very embarrassed. Her voice is strong.

                      RACHEL
         Christ, what an idiot I am.
         Jesus. What the hell's the matter
         with me?
Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony,
who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns
toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting
her around to face Frank. It is Reardon.
                      RACHEL
         Farmer, you've made me a raving
         lunatic.
Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's
presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman.
Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back
toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon.
                      REARDON
                (to Rachel)
         I have to go back out.   Are you
         okay?
                      RACHEL
         Thank you for your help, John.
         I'm fine.
Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony.
Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops
him. Reardon is irritated.
                      FRANK
         Where's Portman?
                      REARDON
         Who?
                      FRANK
         Portman.
                      REARDON
                (breaking away)
         Never heard of him.
Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone.
All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum.
Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room.

                                                                   137.


208   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                        208
      Rachel sits at a makeup table.   Skip Thomas approaches,
      clipboard in hand.
                            SKIP
               Rachel, I'm sorry, but if you're
               going to be in your seat for the
               Best Actress award, you've got
               to do it now.
                            RACHEL
               Skip, I'm moving as fast as I can.
               For chrissake, go twitch somewhere
               else.

      Skip backs off.   Spector and Frank join the group.
                            SPECTOR
               Honey, everything's fine. No one
               noticed anything. Everybody in
               this building is ready to jump out
               of their skin from nerves.
                            RACHEL
               Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer's
               made me a raving lunatic --
                            FRANK
               Something's going on you should
               know about --
                            SPECTOR
               You're making her crazy.   You're
               making us all crazy.
                            FRANK
               Rachel, I know who it is. He's
               here tonight. I think he's...
                             RACHEL
               Shut up...
      This is the last straw. She throws down the powder and
      stands up fast, makeup and purse flying. The powder com-
      pact bursts over the cross lying on the table. Everyone
      in the Green Room looks at her.
                            RACHEL
                      (hissing at him)
               Shut up, you maniac! You never
               stop. Now you've made an ass of
               me in front of a billion people.
               And you won't quit.
      They stare at each other and everyone else stares at them.

                                                                 138.

      Rachel walks swiftly out the door of the Green Room.
      Frank sits for a moment, then stands up. The bodyguard
      follows his charge to the door. He whispers hurriedly
      at Tony as they leave.
                              FRANK
                 Tony, it's Portman.   Remember?   The
                 guy from Miami...
      Spector grabs Tony's sleeve, pulling him back.
                              SPECTOR
                 After tonight, you're back in
                 charge.
                             TONY
                 What?
                              SPECTOR
                 He knows nothing about show
                 business.
      Tony squares off with Spector.
                              TONY
                 You are an asshole.

209   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                     209
      Reardon is just introducing TOM WINSTON, the actor who
      will announce the Best Actress award.
      BEST ACTRESS INTRO (TOTAL 1 MINUTE)

                              REARDON
                 Presenting the Best Actress award,
                 we have the man who last year
                 received the top honor an actor
                 can achieve for his performance in
                 "South Of Waco". Ladies and
                 gentlemen, Tom Winston!
      APPLAUSE
      Frank watches, his eyes scanning, searching the vast
      theatre, squinting as he tries to see beyond the glare
      of the klieg lights and the cameras.
                              WINSTON
                 Thank you, John, thank you, Academy.

                                                             139.

            It brings back some great memories
            to be standing here again. Last
            year I figured something out.
            While it is a great honor to be
            nominated, actually winning caps
            the evening very pleasantly.

LAUGHTER
WINSTON
on stage, speaking and then listing the nominees.
FRANK'S POV - RACHEL, DEVANEY AND SPECTOR
in their seats, up the aisle toward the back of the
theatre, high into the gloom of the balcony.
ANGLE ON STAGE
                         WINSTON
            Tonight we give this award not to
            the best actress, but to the best
            performance by one of five
            exquisitely talented artists...
FRANK'S FACE - searching.
TV CAMERA - focused on the audience.    Its red light goes
on.
ON SCREEN
Rachel's face, expectant, nervous on the screen.
FRANK'S POV - THE PATH
Rachel would have to take to the stage, the steps to the
stage, the faces of the ushers near the stage, the
conductor, ready to play theme music.
                         WINSTON (O.S.)
            ...And the nominees for best
            performance by an actress in a
            leading role are -- Constance
            Simpson for Hot and Cold...
BACK TO SCENE
APPLAUSE. Frank slips through the curtained doorway that
leads to the backstage.
                         WINSTON (O.S.)
            ...Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon...
More APPLAUSE.

                                                                  140.


211   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                211
      Frank comes up swiftly. He stops behind a curtain, six
      feet from the path the winner will take. Tony is there.
      Frank speaks to him and, as he does, he puts a hand on
      Tony's arm. They both look across the stage, past
      Winston into the wings on the other side.
      FRANK'S POV
      In the wings of the opposite side of the stage, half
      hidden by a curtain, a TV cameraman is hoisting his
      lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder. His back
      is to us.

                               WINSTON (O.S.)
                  ... Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night...
      APPLAUSE.
      ANGLE ON FRANK
                               FRANK
                  Tony, I want you on the other
                  side... and check out that guy.
                  He's not supposed to be there...
      Tony trots off quickly.
      FRANK'S POV
      The cameraman half-turns toward us, peering past the
      curtain into the audience. For a split second, we
      glimpse his face. It's Portman. Then someone crosses
      quickly in front of him and he's gone.
                               WINSTON (O.S.)
                  L.C. Dean for I Dream Of Peace
                  ...and Evelyn Gardner for
                  The Harper Plan...
      APPLAUSE.
      BACKSTAGE
      Frank draws his gun. He glances quickly to Tony, but
      Tony's already on his way, trotting round the labyrinth
      behind the set.
      Frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to Tony,
      then realizes his communications are useless. He tries
      to see where Portman has disappeared to, but he daren't
      lose sight of Rachel.
      ONSTAGE - WINSTON

                                                                     141.

      with envelope.
                             WINSTON
                And the winner is... Rachel Marron
                for Queen Of The Night.
                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

      FRANK'S FACE
      grim.   He looks past the curtain to Rachel.
      FRANK'S POV - AUDITORIUM
      Deafening applause in the main auditorium. A stunned
      Rachel stands. Devaney and Spector kiss her. People
      nearby reach out to touch her. Rachel walks along her
      row. The orchestra plays "I Have Nothing."

212   INT. BACKSTAGE - OPPOSITE WINGS - NIGHT                      212
      A mass of drapes and flats. Behind them, the cameraman
      is fixing something to the side of his camera. His back
      is to us. Tony comes up briskly behind him, unable to
      see his face.
                             TONY
                Hey! You! What the fuck you
                think you're doin' back here...
      With amazing speed, the cameraman - Portman - wheels
      around, simultaneously jabbing two outstretched fingers
      from his free hand straight into Tony's eyes. Tony
      cries out, his hands flying to his face.
      Portman's hand moves swiftly again, jabbing to a nerve
      behind Tony's ear, Tony drops like a sack.
      Glancing rapidly around, Portman sees all other eyes on
      the auditorium. He pulls the curtain around Tony's
      body - obscuring it.
      He then removes his own "SECURITY" ID and fixes a
      laminated "PRESS" ID to his lapel.

213   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                   213
      Frank gestures animatedly to the head of security and
      several guards. The music and the applause drown out
      his words and we do not hear them. The guards rush off
      backstage and into the auditorium.

214   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                 214

                                                            142.

Rachel walks along her row. Hands reach out to her.
Some people stand in their seats around her. A crane-
mounted TV camera swoops down between Frank and his view
of Rachel, obscuring her for a brief instant.
CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE

Desperately scanning, seeking.   Suddenly his face
freezes.
FRANK'S POV
As Rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk
toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost
hidden, is Portman -- the camera, hand-held on his
shoulder, moving level with Rachel, 20 feet behind her.

Frank raises his gun.

AISLE
Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps. Tears
in her eyes. Thunderous applause. Security guards in
the side aisles look around in all directions. They
can't see anything.
FRANK'S POV
TIGHT ON Portman, now almost completely obscured behind
the members of the audience, as more and more of them
stand to applaud Rachel.
PORTMAN'S POV
ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA. Rachel keeps appearing and
disappearing behind the heads of the audience.
FRANK IN THE WINGS
Desperate to get a clear shot at Portman but unable to
fire without hitting a bystander.
FROM STAGE RIGHT WINGS - FRANK'S POV OF RACHEL
as she  approaches the podium, steadily, controlling
herself  as she mounts the steps. The outline of her body
becomes  difficult to see against the glare of the foot-
lights  and the lights at the side of the auditorium.
FRANK'S FACE
His eyes squint against the dazzle.
ON STAGE - PODIUM
Rachel approaches Winston.   The applause and music is

                                                                     143.

      deafening.
      FRANK'S FACE
      He can't see Portman past the glare. He can't fire into
      the audience. He knows Rachel is now at her most vulner-
      able. There is only one thing he can do to protect his
      charge.
      BACKSTAGE WINGS
      Frank runs on stage at terrific speed and leaps through
      the air at Rachel, twisting his body as he does.

      ON STAGE - PODIUM

      Rachel turns her head, sees Frank leaping at her and
      gasps out with a mixture of fury and terror.
                              RACHEL
                 No!
      CLOSE ON PORTMAN
      The silenced PISTOL taped to the side of the camera FIRES.
      ONCE. TWICE.
      ON STAGE
      Frank and Rachel tumble over on the floor. The podium
      topples. There are screams from the audience.
      AUDITORIUM
      Pandemonium breaks out. Men run on stage from all
      directions. Guns are drawn. Everyone is shouting. TV
      cameras whip-pan in all directions, security men shout
      into walkie-talkies.
                                                   QUICK CUT TO:
215   INT. MOBILE TV CONTROL VAN - NIGHT                           215
      Chaos on all screens.
                              TV DIRECTOR
                 What the fuck?
                              OTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                 Go to commercial...

216   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                 216
      CLOSE ON PORTMAN

                                                                   144.

      Totally calm and, as he gambled, invisible in the commo-
      tion. Camera still on his shoulder, he slowly backs
      away from the scene. Ushers and uniformed security men
      rush past him towards the stage. People leap from their
      seats. A woman screams piercingly behind him. Portman
      doesn't blink.


217   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                         217
      Dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around Frank and
      Rachel. Rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as
      hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank's shirt.
      He has taken the hits for her. But he's still on the
      job, gaze alert. Without taking his eyes from the audi-
      torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to
      push Rachel back down. The right arm, gun in hand,
      sweeps the auditorium. Where is Portman? Frank can't
      see past the mob.
      Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him.
      Security men try to pull them off. Rachel shouts,
      trying to make herself heard above the noise.
                             RACHEL
                He's my bodyguard. Get off him!
                He's O.K...
      FRANK'S POV - SERIES OF SHOTS
      A SERIES of SWIFT LOW ANGLE SHOTS through legs and faces.
      One brief glimpse that could be Portman. A cameraman
      turns. It's not. Frank is desperate, pushing away a
      helping arm. The chaos mounts. SIRENS WAIL outside.

218   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                               218
      CLOSE ON PORTMAN
      He turns away from the stage as four cops pound past him.
      He walks away. Suddenly, for one brief second, his face
      loses its composure as he looks to the side door.
      PORTMAN'S POV
      Hysterical audience members jostle for the exit, screaming
      and shouting. It's like a football scrum. Cops and secur-
      ity men pushing and pulling. His escape route is blocked.
      CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE - HIS EYES
      Briefly glimpsed through blurred, frenzied, f.g.   Still
      seeking his target, biting his lip in pain.
      PORTMAN

                                                                  145.


      Cool again, he turns back to the stage, seeking an
      alternative escape route, camera still providing cover.

219   INT. ON STAGE - WINGS - NIGHT                             219

      A lumbering figure, blood streaming from one eye, his
      .38 drawn and outstretched. It's Tony staggering to the
      edge of the stage, straight towards his attacker.
                             TONY
                       (bellowing)
                 Frank! Frank! Over here!
      ON STAGE

      Frank and Rachel's heads swivel in unison at the sound,
      looking towards the far aisle.
      PORTMAN
      Against the side wall at the front, Portman's eyes
      desperately scan for the source of the voice. He sees
      Tony, his pistol takes aim.
      FRANK'S POV
      For a split second, two running figures f.g. pass and
      cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman.
      ON STAGE
      Frank FIRES.   ONCE.   TWICE.
      PORTMAN
      Frank's bullets hit home. The first slams Portman in the
      chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits
      the CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face.
      FEMALE ACADEMY MEMBER
      Blood spatters her white Armani dress and the shirt-
      front of her escort. Portman's body slumps forward in
      her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He's dead. His
      pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps.
      ON STAGE
      Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. He
      half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She's
      unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her.
      Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears
      streaming down her cheeks.

                                                                    146.

      Frank Farmer's face. Sad and weary. His guard is
      finally down. Nothing more can happen. He slowly lowers
      the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his
      chest.

      ANGLE ON SPECTOR

      In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men,
      police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves
      the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name.
      There are splatters of blood on it. He tries to wipe
      them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket.

220   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                          220

      A chaos of press and public, ambulance and police lights
      flashing, SIRENS WAILING.
      ANGLE ON PART OF CROWD
      Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher --
      it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his
      hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a dressing
      over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among
      the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan,
      pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is
      happening. He slowly turns and walks away. CAMERA
      CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene.

221   EXT. AIRPLANE TARMAC - DAY                                 221
      A buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as
      the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded
      aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up and Rachel
      gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as
      her bodyguard.
      She greets some members of the band and others who will
      be part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage
      removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane.
      Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is
      conspicuous by his absence.
      As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane,
      Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to
      something O.S.
      Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is
      pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is
      still taped. He smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes
      a quick abrazo.
                             FRANK
                       (indicating eyepatch)
                How's it going?

                                                           147.



                      TONY
         Under control. But it won't be
         the same... ya mutt.
Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the
plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,
till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and
hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony
moves back toward the plane.
Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to
indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.
Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.
Fletcher is ecstatic.
                      RACHEL
         You shouldn't be here.
Frank laughs.    There is a pause.
                      RACHEL
         So, you're quitting show business?
                        FRANK
         Yeah.
                      RACHEL
         Too bad. You had talent.      What
         are you going to do?
                      FRANK
         I thought I might hole up with my
         dad.
                (pats bandaged torso)
         Finish that chess game.
Rachel nods approvingly.
                      RACHEL
         Get him when Fletcher's not
         around.
                      FRANK
                (ruffling Fletcher's
                 hair)
         That's the idea.
Fletcher grins.   Rachel starts to cry.
                      FRANK
         So, how's the new guy?
                      RACHEL
         He's got white hair, Frank.

                                                                    148.



                            FRANK
               He's very good.
                            RACHEL
               Why'd you have to get me an old
               man?
                            FRANK
               I don't trust you.
                            RACHEL
               Yeah... well, give me a kiss and
               let's get this over with.

      Frank gives her an awkward hug.   They kiss.
                              FRANK
               'Bye Rachel.
      Rachel turns quickly. She almost runs up the boarding
      ladder. Frank remains watching her. Fletcher looks back
      over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane.

222   INT. PLANE - DAY                                            222
      Rachel takes a seat beside Fletcher.   Devaney leans over
      the aisle.
                            DEVANEY
               That wasn't so bad.
                      (he sees her tears)
               You okay?
      Rachel is in her own world. Devaney passes the word to
      get moving. The ENGINES WARM UP. Rachel turns and sees
      Frank still standing there looking at her.
223   INT. COCKPIT - DAY                                          223
      The pilot's hand pushes forward on the throttle.
224   EXT. PLANE - DAY                                            224
      The nosewheel starts to taxi.    The plane moves forward.
225   INT. PLANE - DAY                                            225
      Rachel's face at the window.
                              RACHEL
               Wait...

226   EXT. TARMAC - DAY                                           226

                                                            149.


The steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not
fast enough for Rachel.
She jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the
plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair.
Without pausing, she runs to Frank who takes her in his
arms. They embrace and kiss. They kiss again and again.
Finally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled
with tears.
                        RACHEL
           Remember when you said you'd risk
           your life for me?
Frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.

                        RACHEL
           I didn't really believe it then.
           Nobody means what they say. But
           you did, Frank. You did it. You
           laid it all on the line for me.
Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.
                        RACHEL
           Don't wreck this for me. I don't
           want to hear any bullshit about
           you just doing your job. You did
           more than save my life, Frank.
           You showed me a way to be. And I
           love you for it.
                  (a beat)
           There, I said it.
                  (looks at him)
           I'll never forget what it felt
           like to be under your eye. Never.
                        FRANK
                  (smiles)
           I won't be forgetting you either.
She presses something into Frank's hand.
                        RACHEL
           Here... I want you to keep this.
           If you ever need me, you just put
           this on and no matter where you
           are I will find you.  I promise.
She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the
plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm
to reveal the little enamel cross.
ON FRANK
as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out.

                                                                   150.

      The ROAR of the plane becomes APPLAUSE.

227   EXT. CONCERT - NIGHT                                       227
      Rachel's face in FULL FRAME, bathed in light and the
      applause of a huge audience.

                            RACHEL
               Thank you... Thank you... Now I
               want to sing you an old song, but
               it's a new favorite.
      As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the
      band, mike in hand.

                            RACHEL
               You know, this song used to make
               me feel sad... But it doesn't
               anymore.
      Rachel pauses.   The audience is still.
                            RACHEL
               Now it just reminds me of someone
               very special... This is for him.
      Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE
      BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet.
      It's the song she and Frank danced to.    As a VERSE
      TRAILS OFF --

228   INT. CLERMONT HOTEL (IOWA CITY) - NIGHT                    228
      It is a Rotary Dinner.
      The CAMERA TRACKS ALONG the front of the head table which
      runs from one side of the room to the other.
                            ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.)
               Our speaker this evening, the
               honorable congressman from the
               fifth district, Galen Windsor, has
               been a lone, courageous, voice...
               he alone has challenged those who
               have linked organized crime with
               legitimate business throughout our
               state.
      STILL TRACKING, we see the Rotary  President as he nods to
      a distinguished-looking gentleman  one seat to his right.
      On the wall a sign identifying the  hotel and a club
      banner which reads -- "THE ROTARY  CLUB OF IOWA CITY."
      The CAMERA CONTINUES to TRACK and  the Rotary President
      goes OUT OF FRAME.

                                                                  151.


                            ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.)
               But first our benediction will be
               delivered by Reverend Phillip
               Hardy of the First Presbyterian Church.
      STILL TRACKING we see the Reverend get up as the men
      around him bow their heads.
                            REVEREND HARDY
               Heavenly Father, please bless us
               today as we meet in friendship and duty.
      STILL TRACKING as we REACH the end of the table.
                            REVEREND HARDY (O.S.)
               And Lord, whatever dangerous
               endeavors those among us may take,
               let them never be without your
               sanctuary.
      The CAMERA STOPS. Standing against the wall behind the
      table is Frank. As the Reverend's prayer goes on, all
      heads are bowed to receive the benediction. All heads
      but Frank's. The CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT ON his face.
                            REVEREND HARDY
               ... For all we know in our hearts
               that even though we may walk
               through the valley of the shadow
               of death, you are with us...
               guiding and protecting us. Amen.
      The Reverend's final words segue into Rachel's song.
      Frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for
      a moment as though reacting to Rachel's voice.

229   INT. CONCERT - NIGHT                                     229
      Rachel ends a phrase. She dabs at the corner of her eye
      as she continues the song that still binds them together.

230   INT. ROTARY CLUB DINNER - NIGHT                          230
      VERY CLOSE ON FRANK
      His expression, so intense in the opening scene of the
      film, is softer now. Rachel's voice continues as Frank
      carefully scans the room.
                                                FADE OUT:
                              THE END
"BONNIE & CLYDE"

                             by

                David Newman & Robert Benton




FADE IN.

INT. BEDROOM.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE PARKER.  DAY

Blonde, somewhat fragile, intelligent in expression.  She is
putting on make-up with intense concentration and
appreciation, applying lipstick and eye make-up.  As the
camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we
have been looking into a mirror.  She is standing before the
full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up.  She
overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and so
forth.  As the film progresses her make-up will be refined
until, at the end, there is none.

The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly
throughout the first part of this scene.  As the camera
continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that BONNIE is
naked.  Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the
audience, but implied.  That is, she should be "covered" in
various ways from the camera's P.O.V., but the audience must
be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene.  This
is the only time in the film that she will ever be this
exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience.  Her
attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with
narcissism.

The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower-
class frame house in West Dallas, Texas.  The neighborhood
is low income.  Though the room reveals its shabby
surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix it
up.  Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops of
the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (Little glass figurines and
porcelain statuettes and the like.)

BONNIE finishes admiring herself.  She walks from the mirror
and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with
her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposite
wall.  The shade is up.  There are no curtains.  She looks
out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down with
her.

EXT. BEDROOM.  BONNIE'S P.O.V.  DAY.

Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the garage
connected to the house.  There is an old car parked in the
driveway, its windows open.  We see a man walking up the
driveway, somewhat furtively.  He is a rather dapper fellow,
dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a
straw boater.  It is CLYDE BARROW.  Obviously, he is about
to steal the car.  He looks it over, checking around him to
make sure no passers-by are coming.  He peers inside the
front window to see if the keys are in the ignition.  He
studies the dashboard.  BONNIE continues watching, silently.
Finally she calls out.

                                                            2.


                         BONNIE
            Hey, boy!  What you doin' with my
            mama's car?

EXT. DRIVEWAY.  DAY.

CLYDE, startled, jumps and looks to see who has caught him.
Obviously frightened, he looks up and his face freezes at
what he sees.

EXT. WINDOW.  CLYDE'S P.O.V.  DAY.

We now see what he is looking at: at the open window,
revealed from the waist up, is the naked BONNIE.  She looks
down, an impudent half-smile on her face.  She doesn't move
or make any attempt to cover herself.

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF CLYDE - DAY -

-- whose face changes from astonishment to an answering
smile of impudence.  (Seeing what he has, he realizes that
this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police.
Already they are in a little game instigated by BONNIE,
sizing each other up, competing in a kind of playful
arrogance.  Before they speak, they have become
coconspirators.)

Close-up of BONNIE, still smiling.  Finally she speaks.

                         BONNIE
            Wait there!

INT. BEDROOM.  DAY.

Running from the window, she flings open a closet and grabs
a dress, and shoes.  She slips on the shoes, and flings the
dress on, running out the door as she does.  The camera
tracks with her, moving as fast.  As she runs down the
stairs she buttons up the dress.

EXT. DRIVEWAY.  DAY.

She flies out the door, slamming it behind her, runs off the
porch (all this has been one continuous movement since she
left the window, in great haste) and continues quickly into
the driveway.  Four feet away from CLYDE, she stops on a
dime.  They stand there, looking at each other, smiling the
same challenge.  For a few seconds, no one speaks, then:

                         BONNIE
                   (putting her on)
            Ain't you ashamed?  Tryin' to steal
            an old lady's automobile.

                                                            3.


                         CLYDE
                   (with the same put-on)
            I been thinkin' about buyin' me one.

                         BONNIE
            Bull.  You ain't got money for
            dinner, let alone buy no car.

                         CLYDE
                   (still the battle of
                   wits going on)
            Now I got enough money for cokes,
            and since it don't look like you're
            gonna invite me inside--

                         BONNIE
            You'd steal the dining room table
            if I did.

                         CLYDE
                   (he moves from his spot)
            Come to town with me, then.  How'd
            that be?

                         BONNIE
                   (starting to walk
                   onto the sidewalk)
            Goin' to work anyway.

EXT. STREET.  MOVING SHOT.  DAY.

The camera tracks.  It is a hot Texas afternoon, all white
light and glare.  As they walk the block to town in this
scene, their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading.

                         CLYDE
            Goin' to work, huh?  What do you do?

                         BONNIE
            None of your business.

                         CLYDE
                   (pretending to give
                   it serious thought)
            I bet you're a...movie star!
                   (thinks)
            No...A lady mechanic?...No...A
            maid?--

                         BONNIE
                   (really offended by that)
            What do you think I am?

                                                            4.


                         CLYDE
                   (right on the nose)
            A waitress.

                         BONNIE
                   (slightly startled by
                   his accuracy, anxious
                   to get back now that
                   he is temporarily
                   one-up)
            What line of work are you in?  When
            you're not stealin' cars?

                         CLYDE
                   (mysteriously)
            I tell you, I'm lookin' for suitable
            employment right at the moment.

                         BONNIE
            What did you do before?

                         CLYDE
                   (coolly, knowing its effect)
            I was in State Prison.

                         BONNIE
            State Prison?
                   (she shows her surprise)


                         CLYDE
            Yeah.

                         BONNIE
                   (herself again)
            Guess some little old lady wasn't
            so nice.

                         CLYDE
                   (tough)
            It was armed robbery.

                         BONNIE
                   (sarcastically)
            My, my, the things that turn up in
            the driveway these days.

They reach the corner and turn.  They are on:

EXT. MAIN STREET.  DAY.

--a small-town street of barber shops, cafes, groceries, etc.
At the moment, it is deserted.  They continue walking down
the empty street.  CLYDE looks the place over.  Tracking.

                                                            5.


                         CLYDE
            What do y'all do for a good time
            around here, listen to the grass
            grow?

                         BONNIE
            Guess you had a lot more fun up at
            State Prison, huh?

CLYDE laughs, enjoying her repartee.  They continue walking.
At a hydrant, CLYDE stops.

                         CLYDE
                   (showing off, but seriously)
            See this foot?
                   (pointing at his
                   right foot)
            I chopped two toes off of it.  With
            an axe.

                         BONNIE
                   (shocked)
            What?  Why?

                         CLYDE
            To get off the damn work detail,
            that's why.
                   (stopping)
            Want to see?

                         BONNIE
                   (a lady of some sensitivity)
            No!...
                   (turning a cute)
            I surely don't intend to stand here
            and look at your dirty feet in the
            middle of Main Street.

They continue walking in silence past a few stores, each
planning what next to say.

                         BONNIE
            Boy, did you really do that?

                         CLYDE
            Yeah.

                         BONNIE
            You must be crazy.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

                                                            6.


EXT. GAS STATION.  DAY.

Gas station up the block.  BONNIE and CLYDE are seen leaning
against the soft drink chest, their profiles silhouetted by
the bright sun.  They are drinking cokes.  As they begin to
talk, the camera moves in closer to them.  CLYDE takes off
his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead.
BONNIE watches him.

                         BONNIE
            What's it like?

                         CLYDE
            Prison?

                         BONNIE
                   (very interested)
            No, armed robbery.

                         CLYDE
                   (he thinks it a silly question)
            It's...I don't know...it isn't like
            anything.

                         BONNIE
                   (thinking she's heard
                   proof that he's a liar)
            Hah!  I knew you never robbed bo
            place, you faker.

                         CLYDE
                   (challenged)
            Oh, yeah?
                   (studies her, then
                   makes up his mind to
                   show her)


Close-up.  Gun.  Day.  He reaches in his jacket and pulls
out a gun.  The camera moves to a closeup of the gun,
glinting in the sunlight.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

The camera pulls back to show BONNIE looking at it with
fascination.  The weapon has an immediate effect on her.
She touches it in a manner almost sexual, full of repressed
excitement.

                         BONNIE
                   (goading him on)
            Yeah, well you got one all right, I
            guess...but you wouldn't have the
            gumption to use it.

                                                            7.


                         CLYDE
                   (picking up the
                   challenge, proving himself)
            You just keep your eyes open.

EXT. LITTLE GROCERY STORE ACROSS THE STREET.  DAY.

The camera remains just behind BONNIE's shoulder so that
throughout the following scene we have BONNIE in the picture,
looking at what we look at.

CLYDE goes into the little store.  We remain outside with
BONNIE watching.  For a minute nothing happens.  We can
barely see what is going on in the store.  Then CLYDE comes
out, walking slowly.  In one hand he holds the gun, in the
other a fistful of money.  He gets halfway, to BONNIE and
smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality.
She smiles back.  The moment is intense, as if a spark has
jumped from one to the other.  Their relationship, which
began the minute BONNIE spotted him in the driveway, has now
really begun.  CLYDE has shown his stuff and BONNIE is
"turned on."

Suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes
running out into the street, completely dumbfounded.  He
stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent
protest.  CLYDE points the gun above him and fires.  It is
the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a
shock.  The old man, terrified, runs back into the store as
fast as he can, CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIE's hand.  The
camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down
the street.  A few yards and the stores disappear entirely.
The landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved
western plain that begins where the town ends.

EXT. STORE.  AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.  DAY.

A car is parked at the back of the store.  As soon as they
reach it, CLYDE motions and BONNIE gets in.  CLYDE runs to
the front, lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make
it start.  As he stands back, BONNIE calls to him:

                         BONNIE
            Hey, what's your name, anyway?

                         CLYDE
                   (he slams the hood)
            Clyde Barrow.

He runs over to the door, opens it, shoves her over, and
starts up the engine.  The entire sequence is played at an
incredible rapid pace.

                                                            8.


                         BONNIE
                   (loud, to make
                   herself heard over
                   the gunning motor)
            Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.  Please to
            meet you.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

VROOM!  The car zooms off down the road, doing 90.  The fast
country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going
just as fast as the car.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car, still speeding, further down the road.  We zoom
down and look in the rear window.  CLYDE is driving, we see
from behind.  BONNIE is all over him, biting his ear,
ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him--in short,
making passionate love to him while he drives.  The thrill
of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually.

EXT. CAR.  ANOTHER ANGLE.  DAY.

The camera pulls back and above the car.  The car starts to
go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience
just what is happening to the driver controlling it.  The
car swerves all over the road.  The car comes to a sudden
halt.  The car starts again.  It swerves this time almost
right off the road before it straightens out.  It jumps and
jerks.  Another car comes down the road the other way and
CLYDE's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive
right off the road into the dirt.  It is almost Mack Sennett
stuff, but not quite that much.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

--still settling to a stop.  BONNIE and CLYDE appear to be
necking heavily now, punctuated by BONNIE's squeals of
passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to
get to CLYDE.  The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies
apart, however.  In exasperation, BONNIE takes the gear
shift and shoves it forward out of their way.  She plunges
onto CLYDE, burying him from view.

                                                            9.


                         BONNIE
                   (kissing, biting)
            ...You ready?...

                         CLYDE
                   (muffled, laughing)
            ...Hey, wait...

                         BONNIE
                   (giggling herself)
            Aren't you ready?  Well, get ready!

BONNIE has obviously touched him.  With savage coquetry she
tears into her clothes and his.

                         BONNIE
                   (muffled)
            C'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's
            go...let's...

                         CLYDE
                   (muffled)
            Hey...hey, wait a minute...quit
            that now, cut it out.
                   (sharply)
            I said, cut it out!

He shoves her rudely away, slamming her into the far car
door.  Suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting.  Both
unbuttoned and unglued, they stare silently at one another,
breathing heavily.  CLYDE gets out of the car, clearly
shaken.  Despite the fact that he may have encountered this
situation many times before, it's one that no twenty-one-
year-old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss
easily with bravado.

BONNIE remains seated in the car.  She seems terribly
vulnerable.  She fumbles about for a cigarette, too confused
to figure out what didn't happen.  CLYDE turns back and
reaches through the car window from the driver's side,
lighting it for her.  BONNIE casts CLYDE a fishy stare, then
accepts the light.

                         CLYDE
                   (trying to be casual,
                   even insouciant)
            Look, I don't do that.  It's not
            that I can't--
                   (his voice cracks,
                   the match burns his
                   fingers, and he bangs
                   his head onto roof of
                   car, and he goes
                   right on)
            --it's just that I don't see no
            percentage in it.
                         (MORE)

                                                           10.


                         CLYDE (CONT'D)
            I mean there's nothin' wrong with
            me, I don't like boys.

BONNIE doesn't know what she thinks, and CLYDE is trying to
gauge her reaction--whether she feels rejected or repelled.
In fact, it's both--along with a little latent fascination.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, spitting
                   out smoke)
            Boy...boy...boy...

                         CLYDE
                   (a little annoyed)
            Boy, what?

                         BONNIE
            Your advertising is dandy.  Folks'd
            just never guess you don't have a
            thing to sell.
                   (a little afraid)
            You better take me home, now.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting back into car)
            Wait!

                         BONNIE
            Don't touch me!

She gets out of car, leaving CLYDE draped across the front
seat, reaching after her.

                         CLYDE
                   (almost shouting)
            If all you want's stud service,
            then get on back to West Dallas and
            stay there the rest of your life!

This stops her.  Now CLYDE pours it on, with an almost
maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets
control of BONNIE.

                         CLYDE
            But you're worth more'n that, a lot
            more, and you know it, and that's
            why you come along with me.  You
            could find a lover boy on every
            corner in town and it doesn't make
            a damn to them whether you're
            waiting on tables or picking
            cotton, so long as you cooperate.
            But it does make a damn to me!

                                                           11.


                         BONNIE
                   (turning, intrigued)
            Why?

                         CLYDE
            Why?  Because you're different!
            You're like me and you want
            different things.

BONNIE is hooked now.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            You and me travelin' together, we
            could cut clean acrost this state,
            and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into
            Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot,
            and catch ourselves highpockets and
            a highheeled ol' time.  We can be
            somethin' we could never be alone.
            I'll show you...when we walk into
            the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone',
            you wearin' a silk dress, they'll
            be waitin' on you and believe me,
            sugar, they're gonna know your last
            name.

He stops, having begun to woo her to something more intense
than a casual, physical coupling.

                         BONNIE
            When'd you figure that all out?

                         CLYDE
            First time I saw you.

                         BONNIE
            How come?

                         CLYDE
                   (intensely, with real honesty)
            'Cause you may be the best damn
            girl in Texas.

Close-up.  BONNIE.

                         BONNIE
            Who are you, anyway?

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           12.


INT. ROADSIDE CAFE.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE seated in booth, now C.U. CLYDE.  The sound
track bridges the scene: the question that BONNIE has just
asked is now suddenly rebutted by CLYDE, as he points a
finger at her.

                         CLYDE
                   (not answering her,
                   preferring to lead
                   the conversation)
            I'll tell you about you.

He loves doing this and he does it well.  The more he
envisions BONNIE's life, the more instinctively accurate he
becomes.  She grows more and more fascinated, like a child
watching a mind reader.

                         CLYDE
            Lessee...You were born somewheres
            around East Texas...got a big old
            family, right?...You went to
            school, of course, but you didn't
            take to it much 'cause you was a
            lot smarter than everybody else
            anyway.  So you just quit.  Now...
                   (thinking, playing it
                   for all it's worth)
            ...When you were sixteen...no,
            seventeen, there was a guy who
            worked in...uh...

Pull back taking in BONNIE, favoring CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
                   (fascinated)
            Cement plant--

                         CLYDE
            Right.  Cement plant.  And you
            liked him 'cause he thought you was
            just as nice as you could be.  You
            almost married that guy, but
            then...you thought, no, you didn't
            think you would.  So you got your
            job in the cafe...
                   (getting closer to
                   home now, hitting
                   them right in there)
            And every morning you wake up and
            you hate it.  You just hate it.
            And you get down there and you put
            on your white uniform--

                                                           13.


                         BONNIE
                   (enthralled)
            Pink.

                         CLYDE
            And the truck drivers come in to
            eat greasy burgers and they kid you
            and you kid them back, but they're
            stupid and dumb, boys with big
            tattoos all over 'em, and you don't
            like it...And they ask you for
            dates and sometimes you go...but
            you mostly don't, and all they ever
            try is to get into your pants
            whether you want to or not...and
            you go home and sit in your room
            and think, when and how will I ever
            get away from this?...And now you
            know.

BONNIE is half-mesmerized by his talk.  A waitress comes
with their food.  A cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on
each temple in the style of the times.  CLYDE looks at her
and at BONNIE, who also wears spit curls.  As soon as the
waitress leaves:

                         CLYDE
                   (pointing at her hair)
            Change that.  I don't like it.

Without a word of protest, BONNIE immediately reaches in her
bag and takes out a mirror.  She holds it up and with the
other hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair.  She
never again wears them.  When she has pushed them back she
looks at CLYDE for his approval.  He nods his okay.  She
smiles, puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food.
She's ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on
her plate.  CLYDE doesn't touch his food, just watches
BONNIE eat for a minute.

                         CLYDE
            God, you're a knockout.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE.  DAY FOR DUSK.

CLYDE and BONNIE emerge from the cafe into the early evening.
They move toward the car they have stolen.  Just beyond sits
a newer model car.  BONNIE is surprised to see CLYDE head
toward the newer car.

                         BONNIE
            Hey, that ain't ours.

                                                           14.


                         CLYDE
            Sure it is.

                         BONNIE
            But we came in this one.

                         CLYDE
            Don't mean we have to go home in it.

She walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him.
He turns the key and they pull away from the cafe.

INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE.  A WIDE SHOT OF THE PARLOR LIVING
ROOM.  DAY.

The room is bare.  In the middle BONNIE is waking, having
slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of
tattered blanket.  There are windows behind her.  She looks
about bewildered.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde...

She starts to panic and runs to the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing)
            Clyde...

At another window CLYDE appears.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, lady.

                         BONNIE
                   (chagrined at her fear)
            Where you been keeping yourself?

                         CLYDE
            Slept out by the car.

                         BONNIE
            Oh...These accommodations ain't
            particularly deluxe.

                         CLYDE
            No...If they're after us, I want
            the first shot.  Come on, you got
            some work to do.

BONNIE moves to the door and out of the house.

                                                           15.


EXT. FARM HOUSE.  FRONT YARD.  DAY.

On the door is a sign which reads:

INSERT:

PROPERTY OF MIDLOTHIAN CITIZENS BANK -- TRESPASSERS WILL BE
PROSECUTED.

Wide angle.  Across fence.  Day.  On the dilapidated picket
fence six old bottles have been placed.  As BONNIE joins
CLYDE he turns and fires six quick shots.  The bottles
disappear.

                         BONNIE
            You're good.

                         CLYDE
            The best.

                         BONNIE
            And modest...

                         CLYDE
            Come on.  Got you all set up over
            here.

Wider angle.  They move around to the side of the building
where CLYDE points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree.
He means that to be BONNIE's target.  He hands her a gun.

                         CLYDE
            Set her spinnin'.

BONNIE fires.  She misses.

                         CLYDE
            Again.  Come down slow with it...

BONNIE fires again and hits the tire.  She smiles and blows
the smoke from the barrel in pride and self-mockery.

                         CLYDE
            Ain't you something?  I tell you
            I'm going to get you a Smith and
            Wesson, it'll be easier in your
            hand.  Now try it again once...

BONNIE sights.  As she is about to fire, a man appears
around the corner of the building.  A FARMER.  She fires and
hits the tire.

                         FARMER
            Heighdo.

                                                           16.


CLYDE whirls at the sound.  He grabs gun from BONNIE because
his is empty.  He aims at FARMER.

                         FARMER
                   (frightened)
            No sir...no sir.  You all go right
            ahead.

CLYDE watches him warily.

                         FARMER
                   (continuing)
            Used to be my place.  Not any more.
            Bank took it.

CLYDE and BONNIE start to move toward the farmer.  All three
move around to the front of the building.  At a distance we
see an Okie car loaded with belongings.  A WOMAN with a BABY
in arms sits in front.  A smaller BOY stands outside the car.

                         FARMER
            Yessir, moved us off.  Now it
            belongs to them.
                   (He points at the
                   foreclosure sign.)


                         BONNIE
            Well, that's a pitiful shame.

CLYDE shakes his head sympathetically.  He loads the empty
gun.

                         FARMER
                   (bitterly)
            You're damned right, ma'm.

He looks up to see an OLD NEGRO who has come from a distance
shack and now stands near CLYDE's car.

                         FARMER
                   (nodding toward Negro)
            Me and him put in the years here.
            Yessir.  So you all go right ahead.
            We just come by for a last look.

He stands a moment looking at the house and then turns
around toward his family in the car.  CLYDE and BONNIE look
after him.  CLYDE spins and fires three fast shots into the
fore-closure sign.  The FARMER stops and turns, looking at
CLYDE.  CLYDE offers the gun to the farmer.  He looks at it,
then accepts it.  He slowly takes aim at the sign and fires.
It pleases him.  He looks at CLYDE and BONNIE who smile.

                                                           17.


                         FARMER
            You all mind?

BONNIE and CLYDE are puzzled.

                         FARMER
            Hey, Davis!  Come on over here.

The NEGRO moves toward them.  Now BONNIE understands.  She
takes the second gun from CLYDE and hands it to DAVIS.
DAVIS looks from BONNIE to the FARMER and toward the house.
The FARMER fires again.  This time at a window.  He nods to
DAVIS.  DAVIS slowly raises the gun and fires at another
window.  It shatters and they can't keep from laughing.  The
FARMER returns the gun as does DAVIS.

                         FARMER
                   (continuing)
            Much obliged.

He extends his hand.  CLYDE shakes it.

                         FARMER
            Otis Harrison.  And this here's
            Davis.  We worked this place.

                         CLYDE
                   (formally)
            Miss Bonnie Parker.  And I'm Clyde
            Barrow.

Across farmer's car.  Wide shot.  Day.  The FARMER turns and
moves toward his people.  DAVIS moves toward his shack.
CLYDE and BONNIE in the b.g.

Close angle.  BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            We rob banks.

BONNIE turns quickly to look at CLYDE.  He smiles and nods.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

EXT. A LONG, COUNTRY ROAD.  DAY.

A car is driving down it.  It is the next day.  BONNIE is
driving, CLYDE beside her.

                                                           18.


INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            You just stay in the car and watch
            and be ready.
                   (he is playing it
                   cool, knowing she is
                   scared.  He thinks
                   he's James Cagney)
            Okay now?
                   (he hands her a gun
                   from the glove compartment)
            You just be ready if I need you.

BONNIE's hands are tense on the wheel.  Her face shows how
nervous she is now that the time has come.

                         CLYDE
            Scared?

                         BONNIE
            No.

They drive in silence.

                         CLYDE
            What are you thinkin' about?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin'.

EXT. BUSINESS STREET OF A LITTLE TOWN.  DAY.

We are still in the car.  BONNIE pulls over and stops by the
bank.  CLYDE is frozen in his seat.  We can see that, for
all his talk, he is scared, too.

                         BONNIE
            What are you waitin' for?

That gets him.  CLYDE throws the door open and jumps,
practically dives out the door.  The camera follows his
motion right inside the bank, tracking very fast.

INT. BANK #1.  DAY.

Something is very screwy here.  The bank is dark, the TELLER
is half asleep over his books.  CLYDE approaches, thrusts
the gun at him.

                                                           19.


                         CLYDE
                   (with a swagger)
            This is a stickup.  Just take it
            easy and nothin' will happen to you.
            Gimme the money.

                         TELLER
                   (looking up with no
                   fear, his voice calm
                   and conversational)
            Heighdy.

                         CLYDE
                   (nonplussed at this)
            Gimme the money!

                         TELLER
            What money?  There ain't no money
            here, mister.

                         CLYDE
                   (totally befuddled at
                   the turn of events)
            What do you mean there ain't no
            money?  This here is a bank, ain't
            it?

The camera pans around the bank.  We see that it is empty,
dusty and shuttered.

                         TELLER
            This was a bank.  We failed three
            weeks ago.

                         CLYDE
                   (furious)
            What?  What??

In a rage, he goes behind the partition, grabs the teller
and pushes him ahead with the gun.  CLYDE is fuming.  He
forces the teller out the front door.

EXT. BANK #1.  DAY.

--showing BONNIE in the car.  She is terrified as she sees
CLYDE and the TELLER coming at her.  She doesn't understand
what is happening.

                         CLYDE
                   (shoving the teller forward)
            Tell her!  Tell her!

                                                           20.


                         TELLER
                   (acting like a man
                   who has had his sleep
                   interrupted by lunatics)
            As I was tellin' this gentleman,
            our bank failed last month and
            ain't no money in it.  I sure am
            sorry.

BONNIE's reaction is one of hysterical relief and
appreciation of what's funny in the situation.  She laughs
uproariously, she can't stop laughing.  This makes CLYDE
madder than ever.  He shoves the teller to the ground.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

Completely humiliated, CLYDE gets in the car, shoving BONNIE
over.  She is still laughing.  BONNIE starts the car.  CLYDE
points his gun out the window.

Close shot.  Bank window--whereon is lettered: ASSETS-$70,000.

INT. CAR.  CLYDE AND BONNIE.  DAY.

Angle to include bank window.  CLYDE aims and puts a bullet
through each of the zeros.  We see each zero shot through.
Then the entire window hangs there for a second and suddenly
crashes.  On the soundtrack, BONNIE's laughter.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.  DAY.

--still driving.  BONNIE has still not fully recovered from
her mirth, but is quieting down because she sees that CLYDE
is really mad and can't be pushed too far.

                         CLYDE
                   (steaming)
            We got $1.98 and you're laughin'.

She tries to stop.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

The car pulls down another street of shops in another little
hick town.  A grocery store ahead.

INT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it running.

                                                           21.


INT. GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

There is an old CLERK behind the counter, and standing in
the b.g., almost out of our vision, is a BUTCHER--an enormous
giant of a man.  CLYDE steps up to the counter.

                         CLYDE
            Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen
            eggs and a quart of milk.

The CLERK gets the order and puts it in a bag.  He rings
open the cash register preparatory to asking CLYDE for the
money.  CLYDE pulls his gun.

                         CLYDE
            This is a stickup.  I'll take all
            the money in that drawer now.

He reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs
the bills.  He smiles.  Suddenly looming beside CLYDE is the
BUTCHER, brandishing a meat cleaver.  Camera looks up at
this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down,
missing CLYDE and sticking in the wooden counter.  He grabs
CLYDE around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him
off the ground.  The struggle is in silence.  CLYDE is
terrified, fighting wildly to get free.  The gun in CLYDE's
hand is pinned, because the man has CLYDE's arm pinned to
his thigh.  CLYDE tries to raise the barrel at an upward
angle to shoot, finally he is able to do so.  He fires.  The
bullet enters the BUTCHER's stomach.  The BUTCHER screams,
but reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever.
He still holds CLYDE in a fierce hug, staggering around the
store, knocking into shelves and spilling cans.  CLYDE is
hysterical with fear.  He shoots the BUTCHER again.  The
BUTCHER falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release
CLYDE.  In a panic, CLYDE drags the man to the door, trying
to get out.

EXT. GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

BONNIE sees CLYDE and the BUTCHER holding his legs.  She is
terrified.  CLYDE drags him out on the street.  The BUTCHER
won't let go.  CLYDE, in real panic, aims the gun at his
head and fires.  Click.  Out of bullets.  In blind fury, he
pistol-whips the BUTCHER's head with two terrific swipes.
Finally the BUTCHER lets go.  Hysterical, CLYDE jumps away
and leaps into the car on the other side.  BONNIE still at
the wheel.

                         CLYDE
            Get the hell out of here!

They drive-off at top speed.

                                                           22.


INT. CAR.  DAY.

CLYDE is shaken.  He speaks haltingly, panting; trying to
get control of himself.

                         CLYDE
            Damn him, that big son of a bitch...
            He tried to kill me... I ain't got
            eyes in back of my head... I didn't
            want to hurt him.  It wasn't a real
            robbery... Some food and a little
            bit of dough.  I'm not against him.
            Damn!

EXT. SPEEDING CAR.  DAY.

The car is speeding down an open road.  Suddenly it begins
to buck and cough.  There is something wrong with the motor.

CLOSE SHOT.  C.W. MOSS.  EXT. FILLING STATION.

His cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel
lines of CLYDE's car.  There is a distinctly flat sound.

Reaction: CLYDE and BONNIE.  CLYDE stands by the hood.
BONNIE remains seated in the car.  CLYDE is covered with
sweat and grease--clearly he has gotten in his licks on the
engine without success.  Neither he nor BONNIE seems
impressed by the noise C.W. is making.

Another angle.  C.W.--as he screws back the fuel line and
moves between BONNIE and CLYDE to the ignition, turning the
engine over.  It purrs beautifully.  CLYDE is astonished.

                         CLYDE
            What was wrong, anyway?

                         C.W.
                   (moving back to screw
                   on gas cap)
            Air bubble--clogged the fuel line.

C.W. now stands between BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         C.W.
                   (continuing)
            I just blowed her away.

CLYDE still can't get over it.

                         CLYDE
            You just blowed it away.

C.W. belches.  He is embarrassed before BONNIE.

                                                           23.


                         C.W.
            'Scuse me, ma'm... Anythin' else I
            can do for you?

CLYDE nods vigorously, looking across C.W.'s back to BONNIE.
BONNIE gets the message.

                         BONNIE
            Well...I'm not sure...
                   (she looks around)
            Say, them little red things there
            stickin' up?  Are they gas pumps?

                         C.W.
                   (he's not too bright)
            Sure.

                         BONNIE
            Isn't that interesting?  How does
            that there gasoline get in my
            little old car?

                         C.W.
                   (trying to be helpful)
            Well, y'see, there's this tank
            underground, and the gas comes up
            this tube into the pump and into
            your car, M'am.

                         BONNIE
            My, you're a smart fellow.  You
            sure know a lot about automobiles,
            don't you?

                         C.W.
                   (he has no idea he's
                   being toyed with)
            Yeah, I do.

                         BONNIE
            Well, would you know what kind of a
            car this is?

                         C.W.
                   (touching it)
            Yeah, it's a Chevrolet 8-cylinder
            coupe.

                         BONNIE
            No, no.

                         C.W.
            Sure it is.

                                                           24.


                         BONNIE
            No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8-
            cylinder coupe.

C.W. jerks his hand off it as if he touched a hot stove.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting in the conversation)
            You ain't scared, are you?
                   (to Bonnie)
            I believe he is.  What a pity.  We
            sure coulda used a smart boy who
            knows such a great deal about
            automobiles.
                   (suddenly business-
                   like, to C.W.)
            You a good driver, boy?

                         C.W.
                   (getting quite confused)
            I guess so.

                         CLYDE
                   (pretending to cool
                   on him)
            No, I don't think so.  He's better
            off here...

                         BONNIE
            What's your name, boy?

                         C.W.
            C.W. Moss.

                         BONNIE
            What's the C.W. for?

                         C.W.
                   (reluctantly)
            Clarence Wallace.

                         BONNIE
            I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is
            Mr. Clyde Barrow.   We... rob...
            banks.
                   (C.W. reacts with
                   wide eyes)


                         CLYDE
                   (swiftly, testing his mettle)
            Ain't nothing wrong with that, is
            there, boy?

                                                           25.


                         C.W.
                   (nervously)
            Uh, nope--

                         BONNIE
                   (with a put-on sigh)
            No, he ain't the one.

                         CLYDE
            Unless, Boy, you think you got
            enough guts for our line of work?

                         C.W.
                   (affronted in his
                   dumb way)
            What do you mean?  I served a year
            in the reform school.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, a man with a record!

                         CLYDE
                   (laughs)
            Now look here, I know you got the
            nerve to short-change old ladies
            who come in for gas, but what I'm
            askin' you is have you got what it
            takes to pull bank jobs with us?

                         BONNIE
            Mr. C.W. Moss?

                         C.W.
                   (anxious to prove himself)
            Sure, I could.  Sure I could.  I
            ain't scared, if that's what you
            think.

                         CLYDE
            Prove it.

C.W. walks away from the car.  Camera remains where it was.
We see him walk inside the gas station office, open the cash
drawer, close it and come out.  He emerges with a fistful of
money.  He walks over to BONNIE's window, sticks his hand
inside and drops the money on her lap.  We see the bills
flutter down.  Not a word is spoken.  BONNIE moves over into
the middle.  C.W. opens the door and gets in behind the
wheel.  For a moment we see them all sitting there, each
smiling their little smile.  CLYDE starts to hum a hillbilly
tune quietly.  The sound track picks it up (banjo and
violin, etc.) and as the music swells, they drive off down
the road.

                                                           26.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM.  DAY.

A small room with a bed.  On it, covered by a sheet which
humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach, is the
BUTCHER.  His head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a
liquid through a bent glass straw.  Camera is on the left
side of the head of the bed, seeing the BUTCHER in a three-
quarter profile.  On the opposite side of the bed stands a
uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug-shot
photos for the BUTCHER to identify his assailant.  The
lawman holds a stack of them in front of them, swiftly
changing the cards like a grade-school teacher with her
flash cards.  At each picture, the BUTCHER grunts negatively
and goes on sipping from his glass straw.  One picture, two,
three go by.  The fourth picture is a mug shot of CLYDE.
Again the BUTCHER grunts 'no,' without hesitation.  As the
next picture comes into view, we

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOTEL.  NIGHT.

--on a painted wooden sign, lit by one attached light, which
reads: "MOTOR COURT".

INT. ROOM IN MOTOR COURT.  NIGHT.

--in darkness.  Camera is close on BONNIE.  She is awake and
restless.  O.S. comes the measured snoring that we will
think comes from CLYDE.  BONNIE raises up and kneels over
Clyde.  She needs him.  Clyde seems to snore on.  Camera
drops between them and we see that the snoring actually
comes from C.W.  BONNIE drops back on her pillow.  We cut
close on CLYDE.  He is awake.

INT. CAFE.  DAY.

BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. seated in a booth in a cafe.  The
Waitress brings the food and serves everybody.  We see C.W.
With great concentration, as he does everything by relating
to the immediate action he happens to be involved with, he
takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling
sugar over all his food.  He sugars the meat, the beans, and
the beets.  BONNIE and CLYDE watch this performance with
first, amazement and second, disgust.  They can't believe
what they see.

                         BONNIE
                   (incredulously)
            C.W., what are you doing?  Why do
            you do that?

                                                           27.


                         C.W.
                   (beginning to eat it)
            Why not?

                         BONNIE
            It's just disgusting, that's why.

                         C.W.
                   (chewing)
            Not to me it ain't.

                         BONNIE
            But...but it makes everything sweet!

                         C.W.
            Yeah, I know.

With a resigned expression, BONNIE turns away and begins to
eat.  Suddenly a look of consternation crosses C.W.'s face.

                         C.W.
            Damn!  No mayonnaise!

He gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of
the restaurant, out of our vision, apparently planning to
put mayonnaise over the sugar.  The minute he is out of
earshot, BONNIE gets CLYDE's attention.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde, why does he have to stay in
            the same room as us?

CLYDE seems not to have heard the question.  He takes up the
sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark
table surface.  He will sketch his plan in the sugar.

                         CLYDE
            Lemme show you about tomorrow.

                         BONNIE
            Why?

                         CLYDE
            Now C.W.'ll be waitin' right
            outside in the car.  Here is the
            teller's cage.  Four of them and
            over here the desks and what have
            you...

                         BONNIE
            Why, Clyde...

                         CLYDE
            Hmmm??

                                                           28.


                         BONNIE
            In the same room with us?

                         CLYDE
            Hell, where else?  Ain't gonna
            spread out all over the state...

The harshness of his tone concerns him and he recovers with
a smile.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Not yet, anyway.  Now, the door to
            the bank is here now.  You cover me
            from there.

                         BONNIE
                   (takes his hand to
                   her face)
            Just that I love you so much.

                         CLYDE
            You're the best damn girl in Texas.

C.W. comes back with the mayonnaise; looks at the table.

                         C.W.
            Hey, you spilled the sugar.

Three shot.

                         CLYDE
                   (eating)
            The layout for tomorrow up in
            Mineola.

                         C.W.
            Mineola?  Gosh, that's four, five
            hundred miles from here!

                         CLYDE
            So what?  We take U.S. 85 to Willis
            Point, don't you know, and cut over
            on State Highway 28 at Kaufman,
            keep on goin' till we hit the farm-
            to-market road that connects to 105
            and that's right up by Mineola.  On
            a Saturday afternoon...

EXT. SMALL KANSAS TOWN.

The car driving into a small Kansas town.  It is Saturday
afternoon, sunny.  The streets are filled with people, cars,
wagons.  C.W.

                                                           29.


is driving, BONNIE is in front with him, CLYDE is in the
back.  C.W. looks scared to death at the idea of robbing a
bank.  The car pulls up in front of the bank, double-parked.
BONNIE and CLYDE get out.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it running.

BONNIE and CLYDE enter bank.

INT. BANK #2.  DAY.

Cut to the interior of the bank.  BONNIE and CLYDE come in,
assume the class positions--she at the door where she can
cover the bank, CLYDE at the first teller's cage.

                         CLYDE
                   (in a very quiet voice)
            This is a stickup.

                         TELLER
            What?

                         CLYDE
            This is a stickup.

This time everyone in the bank hears it.  The people gasp
and pull back.  CLYDE slowly edges toward the door and prods
BONNIE forward.  She carries a paper sack.  CLYDE motions
her to go from cage to cage and get all of the money.
BONNIE begins doing so, while CLYDE keeps his gun trained on
everybody.  We see BONNIE get the money from the first
teller, the second teller, then...

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET.  DAY.

A car parked in a tight spot has just pulled out.

Close-up C.W.  Day--who suddenly looks delighted to see a
parking space.

EXT. CAR - STREET.  DAY.

Immediately he methodically begins to back in.  It's a tight
spot and he has to cut the wheel, pull forward, cut some
more, pull back and so on.  The scene, for the audience,
should be nervous and funny.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           30.


INT. BANK #2.  DAY.

Inside the bank, BONNIE and CLYDE have filled the sack.
They run out the door, the camera tracks with them.

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET.  DAY.

They run for where the car was, but it isn't there.  Then
they see C.W. has parked it.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Let's go!  Let's go!

C.W. suddenly realizes what a stupid thing he's done.

EXT. CAR.  STREET.  DAY.

C.W. tries to shoot out of the parking spot, but he can't.
He has to go through the business of backing up, cutting the
wheel and all of it.  The scene is one of pure pandemonium
and chaos.

INT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            Come on!  Get it out!

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

A policeman arrives and begins firing at car.  C.W. gets the
car halfway out of the spot, scraping fenders in the process,
and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at
the window--a dignified, white-haired, celluloid-collared
man, obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the
running board.  His screaming can barely by distinguished
from all the noise.

                         MAN
            Stop!

CLYDE fires through the window.

Close-up (special effects).  The face of the man explodes in
blood.  Then he drops out of sight.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car shoots off down the road, doing ninety.  Police are
firing at the escaping car; BONNIE and CLYDE are shooting
out the back window; C.W. is almost having a nervous
breakdown at the wheel.

                                                           31.


EXT. STREET.  A MOVIE HOUSE.  DAY.

A police car that had been chasing CLYDE and BONNIE's car
comes down the street.  It is obvious that the cops have
lost them.  They are searching the street for a sign of
CLYDE's car.  They pass a movie house whose marquee reads:
"GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933."  They slow for a moment, decide that
is not a probable place to look.  They drive off.

INT. MOVIE HOUSE.  WIDE ACROSS AUDIENCE AT SCREEN.

The opening musical sequence of "Golddiggers" is on the
screen.  Ginger Rogers sings "We're In The Money."  Among
the audience we cannot make out our three people.  It is a
small audience and thinly dispersed.

Tight shot at audience.  Camera pans the audience while on
the track we hear the music of the song.  First of our group
who becomes visible is C.W.  He is staring at the screen and
eating bites from a candy bar in each hand.  Camera pans
further and we see that CLYDE is in the row behind C.W. and
a few seats to one side.  CLYDE is nervous and keeps watching
the entrance doors.  He is in a rage.  He shifts in his seat.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, you gotta be poor in the head.
            You...!  Count of you I killed a
            man.  Murder...you too.

Shot from behind CLYDE.  Shooting toward screen.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Dumb ass stupid.

C.W. turns to CLYDE and nods agreement.  This infuriates
CLYDE even more.  He slaps the back of C.W.'s head.

                         CLYDE
            Ever do a dumb thing like that
            again, I'll kill you boy!

Angle at BONNIE.  She has been watching the movie; is now
disturbed by the noise.  She turns back to CLYDE from her
seat on the aisle.

                         BONNIE
            Ssshh!  If you boys want to talk
            why don't you go outside?

She smiles at her joke and turns back to the screen to the
movie which she is obviously enjoying enormously.

                                                           32.


INT. CHEAP MOTEL BATHROOM.  CLOSE-UP BONNIE.  DAY.

On the right of the screen, f.g., BONNIE stands at the sink
fixing her make-up in the mirror.  The make-up has become
more conservative.  On the left, further back, is a bathtub
and in it sits C.W.  His head and knees peek over the gray,
soapy water.  He is engaged with his usual single-minded
concentration, in washing himself, carefully scrubbing his
arms, not a thought in his head.  BONNIE finishes her make-
up and regards herself quizzically, tilting her head to look
at herself at different angles.  She is smoking a cigarette,
and really, studying herself.

                         BONNIE
            What do you think of me, C.W.?

                         C.W.
            Uh...well, you're just fine, I
            guess.  Uh, well, course you're a
            real good shot...and...uh...well,
            sometimes you look pretty as a
            painting.

Camera stays with BONNIE during all this, watching her look
at herself as she listens to C.W.'s evaluation.  She has a
narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him
enumerate her values, she thinks about each in turn and
decides yes, that's true.

                         C.W.
            Hey, uh, Bonnie...could you get me
            that washrag there?

Responding automatically, BONNIE turns and walks to a towel
rack, pulls the washcloth off and starts toward C.W. when
suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden
motion.  Teasingly, she holds the washcloth out at arm's
length.

                         BONNIE
                   (coyly)
            Why'nt you come get it?

                         C.W.
                   (not even realizing
                   what's on her mind)
            Huh?

                         BONNIE
                   (wiggling the
                   washcloth like a
                   bull-fighter's cape)
            Whyn't you come get it, C.W.?

                                                           33.


Suddenly C.W. looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what
that would entail.

                         C.W.
            Aw, Bonnie, come on, gimme it.

BONNIE tries another tack.  She begins sauntering over
slowly, teasingly, still holding out the treasured washcloth.

                         BONNIE
                   (pertly)
            All right, I'll bring it myself.

As she moves closer to the tub, C.W. realizes that she will
be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he
frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth
into the tub, causing a great splash.  BONNIE, somewhat the
victim of the splash, jumps back and away.  Recovering her
composure, she looks at C.W. who is slunk down in the tub
like a gross September Morn.  She has tried him and he has
failed; she realizes now that he was no choice for her; no
real man, even if he might perform sexually.  He is a lump.
This irritates her; his very presence is demeaning to
herself and CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
                   (irritated with
                   herself for even
                   thinking of such a thing)
            You simpleton, what would you do if
            we just pulled out some night while
            you was asleep?

                         C.W.
                   (trying to give the
                   right answer, but
                   obviously faking it)
            Oh, I wouldn't know what to do.
            But you wouldn't do that.  You
            couldn't now.

BONNIE realizes, with some weariness, the inevitable truth
of what he's said; thus resigned, she says patronizingly:

                         BONNIE
            That's right, C.W.  We'll always be
            around to take care of you.

Pointedly, she throws her cigarette in his bath-water,
"Sssssssssss."  She turns and leaves the bathroom, slamming
the door behind her.

                                                           34.


INT. BEDROOM.

Camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom.  CLYDE is
sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling
them.  He is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of
BONNIE's present condition.  The moment she enters, he looks
up.

                         CLYDE
                   (quietly)
            Bonnie, I want to talk to you.  Sit
            down.

BONNIE sits, a little taken off balance by his serious
manner.  But she listens quietly.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            This afternoon we killed a man and
            we were seen.  Now nobody knows who
            you are yet, but they're going to
            be after me and anybody who's
            runnin' with me.  Now that's murder
            now and it's gonna get rough.
                   (BONNIE nods.  CLYDE
                   continues speaking
                   carefully and gently.)
            Look, I can't get out, but right
            now you still can.  You say the
            word and I'll put you on the bus to
            go back to your Mother.  'Cause you
            mean a lot to me, honey, and I
            ain't going to make you run with me.
            So if you want, you say the word.

BONNIE, moved by his offer, has tears in her eyes.

                         CLYDE
                   (as he pauses)
            Why?  We ain't gonna have a minute's
            peace.

BONNIE doesn't like him in this mood.  She tries to josh him
out of it.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, pshaw.

                         CLYDE
                   (trying to make her
                   see the seriousness
                   of it)
            Bonnie, we could get killed.

                                                           35.


                         BONNIE
                   (death has no reality
                   for her)
            Who'd wanna kill a sweet young
            thing like me?

                         CLYDE
                   (amused in spite of himself)
            I ain't no sweet young thing.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, Clyde, I can't picture you with
            a halo, and if you went to the
            other place you'd rob the Devil
            blind, so he'd kick you right back
            to me.

Close-up.  CLYDE--touched deeply, realizes that this was a
lovely thing to say to him.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.

They kiss.  They are near the bed on which are some guns
that CLYDE has been cleaning.  The kiss moves toward real
love making.  They are on the bed and push the guns aside.
Some fall to the floor.  CLYDE breaks the embrace after it
has reached a high pitch.  He moves away from the bed toward
the window.  BONNIE follows him and embraces him from the
rear.  They are miserable.  BONNIE frees him and returns to
the bed.  She falls on it face down.  A gun presses into her
face.  CLYDE sits in the window, the light silhouettes him.
He turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the
window pane.  BONNIE turns to him from bed.  She smiles a
comforting smile at him.  She rolls over onto her back.  The
gun is now under her head and moves it.  She sits up and
gestures to CLYDE.  He remains at the window.  She stares at
him.  She looks toward the bathroom.  She looks back at
CLYDE.  She is moved and pained for him.  She touches her
cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at
her.  Finally he does.  Her look eases him and he almost
smiles.

INT. BUCK'S CAR.  DAY.

Shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the
rear-view mirror of a car.  The car is moving; the doll is
bouncing up and down.  In the front seat are BUCK and
BLANCHE BARROW.  BUCK is a jovial, simple, big-hearted man.
A little chubby, given to raucous jokes, knee-slapping and
broad reactions.  He is, in many ways, the emotional opposite
of his brother.  It doesn't take much to make him happy.
BLANCHE, his wife, is the direct opposite of BONNIE.

                                                           36.


She is a housefrau, no more and no less, not terribly
bright, not very ambitious, cuddly, simpering, madly in love
with BUCK and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight
and narrow.  As the scene begins we hear and then see BUCK,
driving, singing "The Great Speckled Bird."  BLANCHE is
sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine, appearing
fairly miserable.

                         BUCK
                   (singing)
            "What a beautiful thought I am
            thinking
            Concernin' that great speckled
            bird,
            Remember his name is recorded
            on the pages of God's Holy word..."

                         BLANCHE
            All right, now you did foolish
            things as a young man, honey-love,
            but you went and paid your debt to
            society and that was right.  But
            now you just gettin' back in with
            the criminal element.

                         BUCK
            Criminal element!  This is my
            brother, darlin'.  Shoot, he ain't
            no more criminal than you are,
            Blanche.

                         BLANCHE
            Well, that ain't what I heard.

                         BUCK
            Now word of mouth just don't go,
            darlin', you gotta have the facts.
            Shoot.  Why he and me growed up
            together, slept and worked side by
            side.
                   (laughing)
            God, what a boy he was!

                         BLANCHE
            He's a crook.

                         BUCK
                   (chidingly)
            Now you stop bad-mouthin' him,
            Blanche.  We're just gonna have us
            a little family visit for a few
            weeks and then we'll go back to
            Dallas and I'll get me a job
            somewheres.

                                                           37.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
            I just ain't gonna work in your
            Daddy's church--That's final.
                   (laughing it off, singing)
            "What a beautiful thought I am
            thinking
            Concernin' that great speckled
            bird..."

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN.  THE FRONT OF THE MOTEL.  DAY.

BUCK's car drives up to the cabin, honking the horn wildly.
The door of the cabin opens and CLYDE comes running out.  He
is overjoyed to see his brother.  BUCK jumps out of the car,
equally delighted.  They hug each other.

                         CLYDE
                   (hugging him)
            Buck!

                         BUCK
            Clyde!  You son of a bitch!

They laugh happily and begin sparring with each other,
faking punches and blocking punches--an old childhood ritual.
There is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers.
CLYDE is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before.

                         CLYDE
            How's ma?  How's sister?

                         BUCK
            Just fine, just fine.  Send their
            best to you.

                         CLYDE
                   (patting Buck's stomach)
            Hey, you're fillin' out there.
            Must be that prison food.

                         BUCK
            Hell no!
                   (laughing)
            It's married life.  You know what
            they say, it's the face powder that
            gets a man interested, but it's the
            baking powder that keeps him at
            home.
                         (MORE)

                                                           38.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
                   (he explodes with
                   laughter and so does
                   Clyde, who loves
                   Buck's jokes)
            Hey! you gotta meet my wife.  Hey,
            honey, c'mon out here now and meet
            my baby brother.

Camera swings to car.  We see BLANCHE still sitting there,
her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield.
Slowly, she gets out of the car, still carrying the movie
magazine.

                         BLANCHE
                   (suspiciously, quite
                   the grand lady)
            Howdy-do.

                         CLYDE
                   (shaking her hand)
            Howdy-do.  It's real nice to know
            you.

BUCK beams with pleasure, thinking they must like each other.
BONNIE comes out of the cabin, standing on the steps.  The
screen door slams behind her.

Close-up.  BONNIE.  Day--expressionless, looking it all over.

EXT. CABIN.

BUCK and CLYDE notice nothing of this.  BUCK bounds over to
BONNIE, all jollity.

                         BUCK
                   (grabbing her)
            Well!  You must be Bonnie!  Now I
            hear you been takin' good care of
            the baby in the family.  Well sis,
            I'm real glad to meet you!
                   (he hugs her; BONNIE
                   just lets herself be hugged)
            Say...
                   (breaking the hug)
            I'd like you to meet my wife,
            Blanche.

                         BONNIE
                   (stiffly)
            Hello.

                                                           39.


                         BLANCHE
                   (stiffly)
            Hello.

There is an awkward pause.  Suddenly the screen door opens
and C.W. comes out, dressed in his long underwear.  BLANCHE
can hardly stand it.

                         CLYDE
            Everybody, this is C.W. Moss.
            C.W., my brother Buck and his wife,
            Blanche.

                         C.W.
                   (friendly)
            Heighdy, y'all.

He pumps BUCK's hand vigorously and then goes to BLANCHE.
With his characteristic one-track intensity, he decides to
act just as friendly as he can with BLANCHE, ignoring the
fact that he's standing there in his underwear.  BLANCHE,
however, is not ignoring it.

                         C.W.
            Well how do, Mrs. Barrow.  Or can I
            call you Blanch?  I sure am pleased
            to meet you.
                   (shaking her hand;
                   Blanche is slowly
                   going crazy with mortification)
            Did you have a hard time findin' us
            here in this neck of the woods?
            Well, you sure picked a good day
            for it.  Say, you got a Screenland
            there!  Any new photos of Myrna Loy?
            She's my favorite picture star.

BLANCHE is starting to edge over to BUCK in sheer panic at
this strange, young man in his BVD's but C.W. takes no
notice of it.

BLANCHE finally grabs BUCK's arm.  BONNIE watches it all,
smirking.

                         BUCK
            Hey, lemme get the Kodak!

BUCK goes to his car and gets a folding Brownie camera.

                         CLYDE
                   (lighting up a cigar)
            Hey, C.W., go put your pants on.
            We're gonna take some pictures.

                                                           40.


                         BUCK
            Y'all hear about the guy who
            thought Western Union was a cowboy's
            underwear?

BUCK and CLYDE and C.W. laugh heartily.  C.W. goes into the
cabin.  BUCK pushes BLANCHE and CLYDE together, posing them
for a picture.

                         BONNIE
            Lemme get one of my bride and my
            brother.

                         BLANCHE
                   (getting kittenish,
                   and overdoing it)
            Buck!  Don't take my picture now.
            I'm just a mess from driving all day.

                         BUCK
            Oh honey, now you look real fine.

BONNIE watches BLANCHE's behavior with hardly-veiled disgust.
BUCK snaps the picture as BLANCHE is just about to move out
of it.

                         BLANCHE
                   (with unbecoming
                   girlish outrage)
            Did you take my picture?  Oh Buck!
            I declare--

BUCK laughs and goes to BONNIE, takes her by the arm and
moves her next to CLYDE and BLANCHE.  He lines them up,
steps back and takes their picture.  CLYDE is the only one
smiling.

                         CLYDE
                   (pulling out his gun
                   and posing like a
                   movie tough)
            Hey, Buck, get one of this.

BUCK does.

                         BUCK
                   (giving Clyde the camera)
            Clyde, you do one of me and my
            missus.

He puts his arm around BLANCHE.  CLYDE takes the picture.

                                                           41.


                         CLYDE
                   (throwing her a challenge)
            Let me take on of Bonnie.

BONNIE grins at him and responds with amused arrogance.

                         BONNIE
                   (she yanks the cigar
                   from Clyde's mouth,
                   smokes it and poses)
            Okay.

CLYDE snaps the picture.  Everyone but BLANCHE laughs.  C.W.
comes out dressed.

                         BUCK
                   (drawing Clyde aside)
            Hey, brother, let's you and me do a
            little talkin'.

                         CLYDE
                   (handing C.W. the camera)
            Here, C.W., take the girls' picture.

INT. CABIN.  DAY.

They walk into the cabin.  Camera goes with them.  Bedroom
is dark, shades pulled down.  There is an aura of boys'
clubhouse secret camaraderie in the following scene:

                         BUCK
                   (as soon as the door
                   is shut; conspiratorially)
            It was you or him, wasn't it?

                         CLYDE
            Huh?

                         BUCK
            That guy you killed.  You had to,
            didn't ya?

                         CLYDE
                   (they are protecting
                   each other)
            Yeah, he put me in a spot, so I had
            to.  He didn't have a Chinaman's
            chance.

                         BUCK
            But you had to--

                         CLYDE
            Yeah.  I had to.

                                                           42.


                         BUCK
                   (like two kids
                   keeping a secret from Mom)
            Don't say nothin' to Blanche about
            it.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, that time you broke out of
            jail, she talk you into goin' back?

                         BUCK
                   (it is obvious he had
                   hoped Clyde hadn't
                   known about it)
            Yeah, you hear about that?

                         CLYDE
            I won't say nothin' to Bonnie about
            it.

                         BUCK
            I appreciate it.

                         CLYDE
            Yeah...say, what d'ya think of
            Bonnie?

                         BUCK
            She's a real peach.

There is now a long pause--a lull in the conversation, as if
they asked each other all the questions and are now out of
things to say.  It is too much for BUCK, the natural enemy
of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts
out animatedly:

                         BUCK
            Boy, are we gonna have us a good
            time!

                         CLYDE
                   (matching his merriment)
            We surely are!

                         BUCK
            Yessir!
                   (a pause, then:)
            What are we gonna do?

                         CLYDE
            Well, how's this--I thought we'd
            all go to Missouri.  They ain't
            lookin' for me there.  We'll hole
            up someplace and have us a regular
            vacation.  All right?

                                                           43.


                         BUCK
            No trouble, now?

                         CLYDE
            No trouble.  I ain't lookin' to go
            back to prison.

                         BUCK
            Hey, what's this I hear about you
            cuttin' up your toes, boy?

                         CLYDE
                   (ironically)
            That ain't but half of it.  I did
            it so I could get off work detail--
            breakin' those damned rocks with a
            hammer day and night.  Sure enough,
            next week I got paroled.  I walked
            out of that god-forsaken jail on
            crutches.

                         BUCK
            Shoot--

                         CLYDE
            Ain't life grand?

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

We see the two cars, one behind the other, driving down a
main road.

INT. FIRST CAR.  DAY.

CLYDE is driving.  BUCK sits next to him.  No one else is in
the car.

                         BUCK
            And the doc, he takes him aside,
            says, "Son, your old mama just
            gettin' weak and sickly layin'
            there.  I want you to persuade her
            to take a little Brandy, y'know, to
            pick her spirits up." "Why, doc,"
            he says, "you know my mamma is a
            teetotaler.  She wouldn't touch a
            drop." "Well, I tell you what," the
            doc says, "why don't you bring her
            a fresh quart of milk every day
            from your farm, 'cept you fix it up
            so half of it's Brandy and don't
            let on!" So he does that, doctors
            it up with Brandy, and his mamma
            drinks some of it.
                         (MORE)

                                                           44.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
            And the next day he brings it again
            and she drinks some more--and she
            keeps it up every day.  Finally,
            one week later, he brings her the
            milk and don't you know she just
            shallows it all down, and looks at
            her bag and says, "Son, whatever
            you do, don't sell that cow!"

CLYDE and BUCK explode in laughter.

INT. SECOND CAR.  DAY.

At the top of the laugh, cut to the int. of the second car,
riding right in back of them.  The atmosphere is completely
unlike the cozy and jolly scene preceding.  We have dead
silence.  BONNIE is driving, smoking a cigarette, grim.
BLANCHE--seated as far away as she can get from BONNIE
without falling out of the car--makes a face at the cigarette
smoke, rolls down the window for air.  C.W.'s in the back
seat, just staring.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A residential street in Joplin, Missouri, showing a garage
apartment above a double garage.  Camera sees BUCK talking
to a dapper gent with keys in his hand.  BUCK pays him.  The
man tips his hat and walks off.  BUCK gestures and Clyde
drives a car into the driveway.  C.W. follows, driving
BUCK's car with BLANCHE.  CLYDE stops beside BUCK.  BUCK
leans into CLYDE's car and says:

                         BUCK
            I give him a month's rent in
            advance.  We're all set.  Let's get
            inside.

CLYDE calls back to C.W. in the following car.

                         CLYDE
            Pull up and unload the stuff.

                         BUCK
                   (on the running board
                   of moving car)
            Honey-love, I'm taking you into our
            first home.

BLANCHE giggles.  The two cars pull up before the garage and
the people start to descend.

                                                           45.


INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A winded BUCK enters and puts down BLANCHE.  As others
behind him carry in their things and disperse throughout
apartment.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh look, it's so clean, Buck.  And
            a Frigidaire...not an icebox!

                         BUCK
            He give me the grocery number.

He goes to the phone.

                         BUCK
                   (continuing)
            Lemme see, eh 4337...Operator...
            please ma'm, may I have 4337...if
            you please?

                         BLANCHE
            Oh...they got linoleum on the
            counter.  Ain't that clever!

                         BUCK
            Hello, Smitty's grocery...I'd like
            to order a mess of groceries.  Oh
            yeah...eh 143 Hillsdale Street.
            Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops,
            4 pounds of red beans...a can of
            Chase and Sandborn...uh.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, isn't this something, Daddy!

                         BUCK
            Sshh.  Uh...quart of milk...uh 8
            bottles of Dr. Pepper and that's
            it, I guess.  No...no.  Uh...a box
            of Rice Krispies...Bye now.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

Open on BONNIE and CLYDE.  He is cleaning guns.  She is
watching something off screen.  We hear a clicking sound.

                         BLANCHE (O.S.)
            My, you need a haircut, Daddy.  You
            look like a hillbilly boy.

                                                           46.


A look of disgust crosses BONNIE's face.  CLYDE, who has
been watching her, smiles.  The clicking sound increases
suddenly.

                         BUCK (O.S.)
            Gotcha!

BLANCHE whoops.  Camera cuts to see that BUCK and C.W. are
playing checkers and BUCK has just beaten him.

                         C.W.
            Again.

                         BUCK
            Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me
            but you keep tryin' now.

He starts to set up the game again.

                         BLANCHE
            Jest like an ol' man.  Plays
            checkers all the time and doesn't
            pay any attention to his poor
            lonely wife.

She ruffles his hair again.

                         BUCK
            Cut it out now, honey.  I'm gonna
            teach this boy a lesson he'll never
            forget.

Camera cuts to BONNIE, watching with disgust.  Then slowly,
a wicked little smile edges across her face.  She watches
for a moment more, then she rises and with the most ingenuous
look she can muster up, beckons to CLYDE to follow her into
the bedroom.  A little puzzled, CLYDE follows.

INT. BEDROOM.

BONNIE closes the door and immediately begins fussing with
CLYDE's hair, doing a scathing imitation of BLANCHE.  Though
her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with
the Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of
a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual... Indeed the mimicry
allows BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE, and allows
CLYDE to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousness.
We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that
CLYDE could suddenly make it with BONNIE.

                                                           47.


                         BONNIE
                   (doing an unmerciful imitation)
            Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut.
            You look just like a little old
            hillbilly boy, I do declare.
                   (she has her other
                   hand toying with the
                   buttons on his shirt,
                   her hand slipping
                   under, fluttering
                   across his bare chest)
            Oh mercy me, oh my stars!

CLYDE laughs, and BONNIE tugs at the shirt--she kneels on
the bed over CLYDE, who quite easily drapes across it.

                         BONNIE
                   (a little louder)
            Oh, Daddy!  Yore such a slowpoke!

She's letting her hair fall loose, its golden ends brushing
up and down CLYDE's body.

                         CLYDE
                   (amused, but cautionary)
            Hush up a little.  They're in the
            next room.

                         BONNIE
                   (a mock-pout, but
                   with an edge to it)
            Shoot, there's always somebody in
            this room, the next room and ever'
            other kind of room.

CLYDE has his arm around BONNIE, and she's almost draped
across him--but in the direction of the length of the bed,
so their bodies almost form a crooked cross.  She digs an
elbow into his stomach.

                         CLYDE
            Oof!...now that ain't no nice way
            to talk about my brother.

                         BONNIE
                   (imitating Blanche
                   again with baby talk)
            I ain't talking about your brother.

Suddenly BONNIE straightens up to a kneeling position again,
and cocks her head.  When she speaks now it is with a simple
plaintiveness.

                                                           48.


                         BONNIE
            Honey, do you ever just want to be
            alone with Me?
                   (sensing Clyde's
                   sensitivity to the
                   sexual implication)
            I don't just mean like that...I
            mean do you ever have the notion of
            us bein' out together and alone,
            like at some fancy ball, or, I
            don't know, where we walk in all
            dressed and they announce us and
            it's fancy and in public, but we're
            alone somehow.  We're separate from
            everybody else, and they know it.

CLYDE looks up to BONNIE, affectionately.  He runs his hand
carelessly down her body.

                         CLYDE
            I always feel like we're separate
            from everybody else.

                         BONNIE
                   (it's terribly
                   important to her)
            Do you, baby?

Suddenly there is a ring at the door.  BONNIE and CLYDE
freeze.

INT. LIVING ROOM.

BONNIE and CLYDE run out into the living room, camera going
with them.

                         BONNIE
                   (to all)
            Quiet!  I'll get it.

BONNIE goes down the stairs and reaches the front door.

                         BONNIE
            Who is it?

                         VOICE
            Groceries, M'am.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.

She opens the door.  A young man is there with the two big
sacks of groceries.

                                                           49.


                         BONNIE
            How much?

                         YOUNG MAN
            Six dollars and forty-three cents.

BONNIE pays him and goes to take the bags from him.

                         YOUNG MAN
            Here, M'am, them bags is heavy.
            Let me carry 'em up for you.

                         BONNIE
                   (curtly)
            No thanks, I'll take 'em.

She takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and
walks up the stairs.  They are obviously very heavy for her.
Closeup the delivery boy's face, looking puzzled at this
behavior.  BONNIE reaches the top steps, and voices are heard.

                         BUCK'S VOICE
            What was it?

                         CLYDE'S VOICE
            Quiet.  Open the door.

                         BONNIE
            C'mon, c'mon...

Close-up.  The DELIVERY BOY.  A look of suspicion comes
across his face.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.

Close-up of BONNIE--seated in the living room.

                         BONNIE
                   (reading from a pad;
                   in a recital voice)
            It's called "The Ballad of Suicide
            Sal."
                   (she pauses for
                   effect; then begins:)
            "We each of us have a good alibi
            For being down here in the 'joint';
            But few of them really are justified
            If you get right down to the point.
            You've heard of a woman's glory
            Being spent on a downright cur'."

                                                           50.


                         BUCK'S VOICE (O.S.)
            You write that all by yourself?

                         BONNIE
            You want to hear this or not?

As she reads, the camera pans around the room picking out
everyone's reaction.  CLYDE is looking and listening
seriously.  BUCK is grinning.  C.W. is blank.  BLANCHE is in
the kitchen cooking.

                         BONNIE
            "Still you can't always judge the
            story
            As true, being told by her.
            Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty,
            Though her features were coarse and
            tough--"

                         BUCK
            Yeah, I knew her.  She was cockeyed
            and had a hare-lip and no teeth!

BONNIE flashes him a look that could kill.  He shuts up fast.
She continues:

                         BONNIE
            "Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare
            beauty,
            Though her features were coarse and
            tough;
            She never once faltered from duty
            To play on the 'up and up'."

Still listening, CLYDE gets up from his chair and walks
slowly past the living room windows.  The camera angled
slightly above him, sees down the street.  We see two police
cars quietly pulling up.  One of them parks sideways in the
driveway to block escape from the garage, the other stays on
the street.  CLYDE turns and looks out the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (o.s. as we see out
                   the window)
            "Sal told me this tale on the
            evening
            Before she was turned out free,
            And I'll do my best to relate it
            Just as she told it to me--"

                         CLYDE
                   (seeing it)
            It's the law.

                                                           51.


As soon as CLYDE calls out, BLANCHE drops the frying pan on
the floor and begins screaming.  Camera cuts back to the
living room.  Everyone else leaps into action.  Guns begin
blazing from everywhere; we rarely see who is shooting at
whom.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

The police, down the stairs into the garage--we follow them
with a hand-held camera tracking rapidly.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

BLANCHE, however, in utter panic, just runs right out the
front door, and begins running down the quiet residential
street, going nowhere, anywhere.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

BUCK, crouching, shooting with one hand, gets the garage
door open.  A policeman fires.  BUCK fires back and the cop
falls dead in the street.  BUCK, firing, dashes to the
police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake.
CLYDE, BONNIE and C.W. leap into their car, gun the motor,
still shooting madly.  Two more police fall dead or wounded.
One policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a
sawed-off shotgun.  BUCK jumps into the car with the others.
They now begin to bump the police car with their car.  The
police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into
the street right at the group of firing police.  The gang's
car turns into the street toward the running BLANCHE.
BONNIE and CLYDE are in front; BUCK and C.W. in the back
seat firing back at police.  The car pulls alongside the
wildly running BLANCHE; the back door is flung open and in
almost the style of a cartoon, two hands reach out and lift
her off her feet and pull her into the car.  They speed away.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.  DAY.

The inside of the car, still speeding.  BLANCHE is hysterical.
C.W. is still firing out the window.  The pursuing police
car's driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree.  The
gang is not being pursued now, but CLYDE is driving at 90.
BLANCHE is moaning and crying.  BONNIE, in front, turns
around furiously.

                         BONNIE
            Dammit, you almost got us killed!

                                                           52.


                         BLANCHE
                   (crying)
            What did I do wrong?  I s'pose
            you'd be happier if I got shot.

                         BONNIE
                   (at her bitchiest)
            Yeah, it would of saved us all a
            lot of trouble.

                         BLANCHE
            Buck, don't let that woman talk to
            me like that!

                         BUCK
                   (caught in the middle
                   of a bad situation,
                   knowing Blanche is
                   wrong, but trying to
                   soothe her)
            You shouldn't have done it, Blanche.
                   (quietly, cont.)
            It was a dumb thing to do.

                         BLANCHE
                   (switching tactics)
            Please, Buck, I didn't marry you to
            see you shot up!  Please, let's go!
            Let's get out of here and leave.
            Make him stop the car and let us out!

                         BUCK
                   (still quietly)
            Can't.  I killed a man.  We're in
            this now.

                         BLANCHE
                   (loud and shrill)
            Please!  Please!

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            Shut up!  Just shut up your big
            mouth!  At least do that, will ya,
            just shut up.

                         CLYDE
            Cut it out, Bonnie.

BONNIE is affronted.  BLANCHE continues sobbing.

                         BONNIE
                   (curtly)
            Stop the car.  I want to talk to you.

                                                           53.


Without a word, CLYDE stops the car.

EXT. ROADSIDE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE get out and walk fifteen feet away from the
car.  Both are irritated and touchy.  Camera follows them.

                         CLYDE
                   (coldly)
            What is it?

                         BONNIE
            Get rid of her.

                         CLYDE
            Can't do that.  She's Buck's wife.

                         BONNIE
                   (snapping her words)
            Get rid of both of them then.

                         CLYDE
            Why?  What's the matter with you
            anyway?

                         BONNIE
            She's what's the matter with me, a
            damn stupid back country hick
            without a brain in her head.
                   (contemptuously)
            She ain't nothin' but prunes and
            proverbs.

                         CLYDE
                   (really pissed-off at Bonnie)
            What makes you any better?  What
            makes you so damn special?  You're
            just a West Dallas waitress who
            spent half your time pickin' up
            truck drivers!

This hits home with BONNIE.  He has said the unforgivable.

                         BONNIE
                   (raising her voice)
            You talk to me like that!  Big
            Clyde Barrow, just the same as your
            brother, an ignorant uneducated
            hillbilly.
                   (with deadly archness)
            Only special thing about you is
            your peculiar ideas about
            lovemakin'--which is no love makin'
            at all.

                                                           54.


CLYDE stiffens.  The two of them stand silent and tense,
almost quivering with anger.  They have stripped each other
raw.  CLYDE turns and looks back at the car.  Everyone is
waiting, watching them.  He breathes a deep sigh, like a man
counting to 10 to hold his temper.

                         CLYDE
            Look, Bonnie--

He can't finish.

Close.  BONNIE.  She drops her head into her hand for a
moment, comes up a little more relaxed.  She looks at CLYDE
and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has
inflicted on him.  She softens.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde...honey...I didn't mean all
            that, honey.  Blame it on all that
            shootin', I just felt so bad...sure
            enough...Clyde?

                         CLYDE
            Okay...Okay, hon...let's get
            movin'...

He turns and begins walking back to the car.  BONNIE walks
alongside him.  On the few steps back, she regains all her
dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her.  She
reaches the car.  CLYDE opens her door for her and she gets
in like a great lady.  He walks around to his side, gets in,
and they drive off.

WIDE SHOT.  EXT. CAR.  DAY.

A very wide shot.  We see CLYDE's car driving along a wooded
road.  For a moment that is all we see, then we should
become aware that far in the distance another car is
following CLYDE's.

Close. Rural mail box.  On the opposite side of the road,
CLYDE's car swings across the road and CLYDE, who is driving,
snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands
it into the car.  They drive out of the shot.  Camera holds
and soon the following car enters the shot.  The man driving
is a Texas ranger.  He drives slowly.  He drives out of the
shot.

INT. CLYDE'S CAR.

BUCK is reading from the paper.

                                                           55.


                         BUCK
                   (jubilantly)
            Hey, y'all, listen to this here:
            Law enforcement officers throughout
            the Southwest are frankly amazed at
            the way in which will-of-the-wisp
            bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow-
            haired companion, Bonnie Parker,
            continue to elude their would-be
            captors.  Since engaging the police
            in a gun battle on the streets of
            Joplin Missouri and slaying three
            of their number...

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, Lord...

We notice CLYDE is wincing.

                         BUCK
            ...the Barrow gang has been reported
            as far West as White City, New
            Mexico, and as far north as Chicago.
            They have been credited with
            robbing the Mesquite Bank in the
            aforementioned White City, the J.J.
            Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas,
            the Sanger City National Bank in
            Denton, Texas on three different
            occasions.  In addition to these
            robberies, the fast travelling
            Barrows have been rumored to have
            had a hand in the robbing of two
            Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and
            one A&P store in Missouri, though
            Chief Percy Hammond, who first
            identified Clyde Barrow's brother,
            Buck, as a member of the gang,
            expressed some doubt that these
            last robberies were committed by
            the Barrow Gang alone.

                         BONNIE
            Go on.

                         C.W.
                   (finally)
            Clyde, we ain't goin' to see a
            restroom for another thirty miles.
            Why don't you just stop here?

CLYDE looks relieved.

                                                           56.


EXT. WOODED AREA.  DAY.

He pulls the car to a stop, gets out and goes off into the
woods.  We watch him vanish behind the trees.

INT. CAR.

BUCK still scanning the newspaper.

                         BUCK
                   (with a laugh)
            Hey now, here's something!  Listen
            here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers
            In Hunt For Barrow.  Police Officer
            Howard Anderson's heart turned
            faster than his motorcycle when he
            forced to the side of the road a
            roaring black V-8 sedan in which
            were three men and a blondheaded
            woman yesterday afternoon.

Everybody laughs.  As BUCK continues to read, his voice
remaining on the soundtrack.

EXT. CAR.

The camera goes outside the car and pulls back, way back, to
reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car.  The
car stops a good distance away and one man gets out, the
only occupant of the car.  He is tall, dressed in the
uniform of the Texas Ranger.  He draws his gun and slowly
approaches the car from the rear.  On the soundtrack BUCK's
voice continues; as we see all this taking place.

                         BUCK
            When he saw several machine guns in
            the car he was certain he'd caught
            Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and
            maybe Buck Barrow and the third
            unidentified member of the gang.
            It took a lot of telephoning and
            explaining to convince the
            motorcycle cop that his captives
            were two highway patrolmen and a
            blonde-haired stenographer from the
            Highway Patrol--.  Haw!  Haw!
                   (everybody busts up
                   with laughter)


In the meantime, on screen, the lawman is slowly approaching
the back of the car.  Suddenly, cut to shot of CLYDE coming
out of the woods, behind the lawman.  His gun is tucked in
his pants.  In a second, he sees what is happening.

                                                           57.


BUCK's voice is continuing:

                         BUCK
            Anderson was held up as an example
            for every other Texas peace officer
            today. "That was a mighty brave
            thing," explained Highway Patrol
            Chief L.C. Winston.

CLYDE whips out his gun.  The following scene is played
exactly like a classic fast-draw in an heroic Western.

                         CLYDE
            Sheriff!

BRYCE spins around.  Both men fire instanteously, but CLYDE
has the draw on him, and the aim.  The gun goes flying from
the SHERIFF's hand.  A really razzle-dazzle display of
grandstand marksmanship from Clyde.

Immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the
man, guns drawn.

                         C.W.
            Boy!  What a shot, Clyde!

                         BUCK
            Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin'
            like that!

The gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt.
CLYDE makes him lean on the car's hood, arms extended, legs
spread, while he frisks him.  In general, everyone is
excited over the capture.  BONNIE takes the sheriff's gun
and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an
object d'art.

                         CLYDE
                   (examining the man's
                   wallet, really surprised)
            Well, now, getta load of this.  I
            want y'all to know we are in the
            custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and
            Frank here is a Texas Ranger.

Rev. angle across hood--so BRYCE's face, not visible to
CLYDE or anyone else behind him, is in foreground.  His
gnarled, powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho
they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper.  His
eyes stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but
without passion.  They are shark's eyes.  They have witnessed
much carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more.

                                                           58.


                         C.W.
            Sure 'nough, Clyde?

                         BUCK
            Say there, peacemaker.  I believe
            you got your spurs all tangled up.
            You're in Missouri, you know that?

CLYDE has been going thru the man's  credentials.  Not so
pleasantly:

                         CLYDE
            You didn't know you was in Missouri?

                         C.W.
            He's lost, this here Texas Ranger.

CLYDE claps BRYCE's hands behind his back, handcuffs him,
spins him around.

                         CLYDE
                   (a little pissed)
            --he ain't lost...them banks are
            offerin' extra reward money fer us,
            and Frank figured on easy pickin's,
            didn't you?
                   (he suddenly knocks
                   Bryce's hat off)
            Didn't you?

BRYCE flinches involuntarily.  BUCK suddenly grows wary at
CLYDE's mood.  CLYDE leans into BRYCE, looking up.

                         CLYDE
            --Now you ain't hardly doin' your
            job, Texas Ranger.  You oughta be
            home lookin' after the rights of
            poor folks, not out chasin' after us.

He suddenly hefts BRYCE's huge bulk onto the fender.

                         BUCK
                   (trying to be casual)
            Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so
            personal.

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            Reg'lar laws is one thing.  But
            this here bounty hunting, we got to
            discourage that.

BLANCHE looks very uncomfortable.  She starts to say
something, but BUCK intervenes.

                                                           59.


                         BUCK
            Like how, Clyde?--

A tense moment.  CLYDE can't think of anything right away.

                         C.W.
                   (trying to be helpful)
            Shoot him.

BONNIE shoots C.W. an angry glance--it's just what the gang
doesn't want.

                         C.W.
                   (trying again)
            ...hang him?...

Reaction--BONNIE carefully gauging the moment to intervene.

                         BONNIE
                   (suddenly)
            --uh-uh.  Take his picture.

CLYDE's not sure he's heard right.  Neither is C.W.

                         C.W.
            Take his picture?

                         BONNIE
                   (pointedly ignoring
                   C.W., brightly)
            Then we'll let the newspapers have
            it--so's everyone can see Captain
            Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers
            with the Barrow gang--
                   (moving demurely to Bryce)
            --and all bein' just as friendly as
            pie.

                         BUCK
                   (grasping
                   possibilities immediately)
            ...yeah, yeah...

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing right on,
                   coyly picking up
                   Bryce's gun from grill)
            --why we 'bout the friendliest
            folks in the world.  Texas Ranger
            waves his big ol' gun at us, and we
            just welcome him like he's one of
            our own.

                                                           60.


                         CLYDE
                   (grinning widely)
            Buck, get the Kodak!

                         BUCK
                   (relieved and excited)
            Hot dog!

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            We're mighty proud to have a Texas
            Ranger in the family.

BRYCE is obviously not pleased with this turn of events.
Following dialogue is overlapped, ad-libbed, etc.  A sense
of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to
exact.

New angle.  BUCK is fiddling with the camera, setting up the
shot with CLYDE.  BUCK's following speech should be heard,
b.g., to CLYDE's speech below it.

                         BUCK
            ...keep him set on the hood,
            there...more to the sun, like
            that...yeah...when all his ranger
            friends see this...I bet he's gonna
            wish he was dead!

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            ...see what come o' your
            mischief?...not doin' your job?
            Down in Duncanville last year poor
            farmers kepts the laws away from us
            with shot guns...you're s'posed to
            be protectin' them from us, and
            they're protectin' us from you.
                   (giggling)
            --don't make sense, do it?

                         BUCK
            C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie
            first.  Move into him, right close,
            right friendly.

                         CLYDE
            All righty
                   (to Bryce, whose
                   hands are tied,
                   hemmed in by them both)
            Don't move, now, hear?

                                                           61.


CLYDE grandly puts an arm on BRYCE's shoulder, BONNIE,
looking up admiringly from the other side.  BUCK takes the
picture.  BONNIE immediately hops onto the hood, next to
BRYCE.

                         BONNIE
            How's this? "Captain Bryce and new
            found friend."

She coyly loosens his tie, tousles his hair, and plants a
big kiss on him while still ogling camera.

                         CLYDE
            ...yeah, yeah...quick, Buck, get
            it...

                         BUCK
            ...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it.

Quite suddenly BRYCE, whose simmering intensity we should be
more sensitive to than the gang is, spits on Bonnie.  BONNIE
half-screams in disgust, but CLYDE is on top of BRYCE in a
flash, half-strangling on his own fury.  He pulls BRYCE off
the fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily
like a lasso.  BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by
the force, and, with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs, plummets
down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men
falling, spinning.  BRYCE rises shakily.  He tries to walk
away.  CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him
out into the water.  BRYCE smacks into a tree stump poking
out of the shallows and goes down.  CLYDE is on top of him.

Meanwhile, BUCK has rushed down into the water, tries to
pull CLYDE off BRYCE.

                         BUCK
                   (frantic)
            I got the picture.  I got the
            picture...

                         CLYDE
                   (oblivious)
            Lemme be, lemme be...

BRYCE reaches the surface and CLYDE tries to throw him into
deeper water.  He hitches BRYCE over a moldy skiff, knocking
aside one of the oars.  BUCK upends BRYCE into the skiff and
kicks it spinning.  CLYDE picks up an oar and hurls it like
a boomerang, ass over end at the skiff.  It kicks up a spray.

                         BUCK
                   (holding tightly to
                   Clyde, yelling)
            I got the PICTURE!

                                                           62.


Reaction.  CLYDE waist deep, breathing heavily.

                         CLYDE
            ...All right, all right...
                   (to Bryce, yelling)
            WE GOT YOU...HEAR?... REMEMBER...
            YOU... YOUR FACE...WE GOT IT...WE
            GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...

BRYCE, battered and handcuffed, stares back with mindless
malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical
spectre of CLYDE, screaming his madness across the water.

                                            DISSOLVE:

INT. BANK.

Inside the bank.  In contrast to the previous inept bank
robbery scene, this one goes admirably well, the gang
performing slickly and without a hitch.  As they enter,
dripping wet, CLYDE makes a general announcement to everyone
to the bank.

                         CLYDE
            This is the Barrow gang.
                   (the people turn and freeze)
            Everybody just take it easy and
            nobody will get hurt.

CLYDE covers the door.  BONNIE and BUCK go to the tellers'
cages and get money.  BUCK goes inside, emptying out the
cash drawers.  Cut to BONNIE filling the sack.

Cut to a close-up of a burglar alarm button.  Slowly a hand
crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the
button.  When the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a
gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away.  The
camera pulls back to reveal BUCK smiling at a lady teller.

                         BUCK
            Don't do nothin' silly now.

Cut to CLYDE standing near the door, training his guns on
the entire bank.  A farmer stands a few feet away, some
bills clutched in his hand.

                         CLYDE
            That your money or the bank's?

                         FARMER
            Mine.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it, then.

                                                           63.


Across the floor, the bank guard in the corner takes
advantage of CLYDE's distraction to go for his gun.  CLYDE
spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guard's
hat off without harming him.

                         CLYDE
                   (to the guard, who
                   has practically
                   frozen in fear)
            Next time I'll aim a little lower.

They finish robbing the bank.  They start to exit.  Near the
door stands a guard with his hands raised.  He wears sun
glasses of the period.  As they leave BUCK snatches the sun
glasses from the guard's head.

                         BUCK
            Get a good look at us!  We're the
            Barrow boys.

EXT. BANK.  DAY.

The gang runs wildly into the street where the car waits,
motor running.  As they leap into car, BUCK throws the sun
glasses into BLANCHE's lap.

                         BUCK
            Happy birthday.

They zoom off.  Shots are heard.  BONNIE, BUCK and CLYDE
begin firing at the bank guards who are pursuing them.  The
guards fire back.

Close-up.  BLANCHE sitting in the back seat with her fingers
stuck tightly in her ears, eyes shut, trying to overcome her
panic.  A funny image, but one that also awakens pity.  The
next sequence is carried out in cross-cutting.

                                            CUT TO:

The street in front of the bank.  Police car pulls up and
the excited crowd gestures in the direction of the departed
gang.  The siren starts.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. GANG CAR.  DAY.

The siren heard now in the far distance.

                         BUCK
                   (to C.W. at the wheel)
            Kick it in the pants, C.W.

                                                           64.


                         CLYDE
            We got to make that state line!

                         C.W.
                   (driving like a wild
                   man, but adlibing loudly)
            Can't get more'n this out of a
            Plymouth!

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

The gang has left a legacy of celebrity behind.  We see the
bank guard whose hat was shot off being interviewed by a
reporter.  He is seated in a chair, his shirt open at the
collar and a woman teller is fanning him.

                         BANK GUARD
                   (enjoying the limelight)
            Then he saw me goin' for my gun.
            Clyde Barrow himself, I mean.  And
            suddenly I was starin' into the
            face of death!

                         WOMAN TELLER
            Tsk, tsk.

A photographer steps in.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
            Just look this way, Mr. Hawkins.

The bank guard hurriedly buttons up his collar and smiles as
the flashbulb goes off.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. GANG CAR.

Still speeding along, the siren more distant.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

The bank president and a policeman are posing for that
classic picture where both stand flanking a bullet hole in
the wall and point proudly at it.  The flashbulb goes off.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. POLICE CAR.

Two men in police uniforms following BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Step on it, Randolph.  We gotta
            catch 'em 'fore they reach the
            state line!

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

FARMER is describing BONNIE and CLYDE to passersby who dote
on him as though he'd just had contact with a portion of the
true cross.  FARMER is aware of his position.

                         FARMER
            Clyde?...he looked like, well he
            looked real...clean...and Bonnie,
            she's too much a lady ever to be
            caught with a cigar in her mouth...I
            don't care what you heard before.
            I saw 'em right here, not twenty
            minutes ago...
                   (gravely)
            --and all's I can say is, they did
            right by me, and I'm bringin' me a
            mess of flowers to their funeral.

INT. GANG'S CAR.

Car slows up perceptibly as CLYDE says:

                         CLYDE
            Okay, relax.  We're in Oklahoma now.
            Slow down.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. POLICE CAR.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Turn around.  Don't waste no more
            gas.

                         SECOND POLICEMAN
                   (a young eager beaver type)
            Ain't we gone to catch 'em?

                                                           66.


                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Hell, they're over the State line.
            That's out of our jurisdiction.

                         SECOND POLICEMAN
            Why don't we get 'em anyway?

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            I ain't gone to risk my life in
            Oklahoma.  That's their problem.

Now the gang's car is seen traveling down a long, narrow
country road surrounded by cornfields.

EXT. ROADSIDE BY WOODS.  DAY.

They get out, taking the various bags of money with them,
and dump the lot on the hood.  There is not an impressive
amount of money.

                         CLYDE
                   (disappointed)
            Hell.  That ain't much, is it?

                         BUCK
                   (commiseratingly)
            Times is hard,

                         CLYDE
            Well, let's get to it.

He begins dealing and splitting the money out on the hood of
the car, as they gather around.

                         CLYDE
            This is Clyde Barrow.
                   (lays down a bill)
            Buck Barrow...
                   (lays down a bill)
            Bonnie Parker...C.W.
                   (goes back to the
                   first again and lays
                   out another round)
            Clyde, Buck...Bonnie...C.W. Clyde,
            Clyde again...Buck...Bonnie...C.W.

BUCK and BLANCHE stand watching.  BLANCHE looks fretful.
She nudges BUCK and whispers to him.

                                                           67.


BUCK whispers something back to her.  Meanwhile, CLYDE's
counting still goes on.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie...C.S....Clyde...

                         BUCK
                   (very ill at east in
                   this position he has
                   been forced into)
            Um...eh...Clyde?

                         CLYDE
            Hah?

BUCK is clearly embarrassed.

                         BUCK
            Uh, Clyde...well...what about
            Blanche?

Everyone reacts with stunned amazement at BLANCHE's nerve in
wanting to get her cut.

                         BONNIE
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?

BLANCHE sees she has to rise to her own defense, and she
rises to the occasion with spirit and verve.

                         BLANCHE
            Well, why not?  Say I earned my
            share!  Same as everybody.  I
            coulda got killed same as everybody,
            and I'm wanted by the law same as
            everybody.  Besides I coulda got
            snake bit sleepin' in them woods
            every night!
                   (building it up)
            I'm just a nervous wreck and that's
            the truth.  And I have to listen to
            sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all
            the time.  I deserve mine!

Close.  BUCK.  Day--looking at CLYDE, his face full of weak
smiles and embarrassment at his wife.

                         CLYDE
                   (with a sigh)
            Okay...okay...hold your horses,
            Blanche.  You'll get your share.

                                                           68.


BONNIE is livid but says nothing.  CLYDE, the leader has
decided.  C.W. looks indignant, like a hog who's just been
given a bath.  CLYDE begins counting all over again in near
silence.

                         BUCK
            Married a preacher's daughter and
            she still thinks she's takin' the
            collection.

Everyone now laughs, but BLANCHE.  CLYDE continues counting.

                         BUCK
                   (to Blanche)
            Well, don't spend it all in one
            place now, hear?

                         BONNIE
            She'll be doin' right well to spend
            it at all.

BONNIE turns and ambles away from the car.  After a moment
CLYDE stops counting and moves after her.  He's prepared for
a fight, stands behind BONNIE's arched back trying to gauge
the degree of hostility there.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie?

No answer.

                         CLYDE
                   (a little defensive)
            Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I
            guess I'll keep sayin' it before
            we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife
            and Buck is family.

He waits expectantly.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, utterly
                   without malice)
            --she's such a silly-Billy...

BONNIE looks plaintively to CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
            My family could use some of that
            money.

                                                           69.


                         CLYDE
            Them laws have been hangin' round
            your mamas house 'til all hours,
            Bonnie.  It's just too risky to go
            there.

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            Well, where can we go?  We rob the
            damn banks, what else do we do?

CLYDE cannot really answer.  Suddenly C.W. starts yelling:

                         C.W.
            CLYDE!  CLYDE!  CLYDE!

CLYDE flinches at the sound.  C.W. comes bounding over, as
rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be.

                         CLYDE
                   (wincing as they are
                   nose to nose)
            I hear you, C.W.

                         C.W.
            This ol' heap's gushin' oil!  We
            got to swipe us another set of
            wheels right away, or we won't get
            anywhere.  Look here.

He reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey
handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces.

                         C.W.
            See?

CLYDE nods slowly.  He looks back to BONNIE.  He sees.

                                            DISSOLVE:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.

A residential neighborhood on a suburban street.  A rather
well-to-do neighborhood.  The camera is up on a porch of a
white frame house, looking toward the street.  On the porch,
sitting in the swing in the left f.g. are a MAN and a WOMAN.
She is about twenty-nine, he is about thirty-six.  He is
sitting with his back to us, embracing the WOMAN.  They are
spooning, making low, loving murmurs.

                         WOMAN
            Oh, now...now, dear...

                                                           70.


                         MAN
            Mmmm...sweet thing...

We see in the distance two cars parked in front of the house.
His and hers.  Suddenly we see another car drive up (BONNIE
and CLYDE) and somebody gets out.  Then the whole gang gets
out, ditches the one car and gets in one of the parked cars.
All the while the couple on the porch is busy spooning.  The
car begins to roll slowly into the street.  The WOMAN notices.

                         WOMAN
            Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?

                         MAN
                   (still nuzzling her)
            Mmmmmm...huh?
                   (he looks, leaps from
                   the swing)
            That's my car!  Hey!

The MAN and WOMAN run down the front steps and front walk to
the second car.  They jump in and take off, giving chase.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

The WOMAN is driving (it's her car).  The MAN is furious.

                         EUGENE
            I'll tear 'em apart!  Those punks!
            Steal a man's car right out from
            under him!  Wait till I get my
            hands on those kids, Velma, I'll
            show 'em!

They continue driving, furious, the man cursing and muttering.
We see through their windshield the other car way in the
distance.

                         VELMA
            What if they have guns, Eugene?

                         EUGENE
                   (realizing the
                   possibility, he
                   suddenly stops being
                   mad and turns chicken)
            We'd better get the police and let
            them handle this.

                         VELMA
            Right.

                                                           71.


                         EUGENE
            Turn around and let's get back to
            town.  We'll go get the sheriff.

They are by now on a narrow dirt road and the WOMAN has to
execute a U-turn.  It takes her about seven cuts to turn the
car around in the narrow space.  They start back to town.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BONNIE AND CLYDE'S CAR.

BUCK looks out the rear window.

                         BUCK
            They stopped chasin' us.  They
            turned around.

Close-up.  CLYDE grinning mischievously.

                         CLYDE
            Let's take 'em.

BUCK and C.W. laugh appreciatively at the reversal.  CLYDE
turns the car around.  He performs the U-turn in the same
narrow space in one, swift, smooth, beautiful turn.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. THE OTHER CAR.

VELMA looks in the rear view mirror and sees that now she is
being chased.

                         VELMA
            Oh, my Lord, they're comin' after us.

                         EUGENE
                   (in a panic)
            Step on it, Velma, step on it!

Close-up.  Accelerator.  VELMA jams it down to the floor.
The car speeds.

EXT. ROAD.  THE CHASE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car gaining on them, gaining on them,
gaining on them and finally overtaking them, coming up and
ahead, forcing them to the side of the road.

Med. shot.  The MAN and WOMAN's car.  Terrified, they roll
up their windows, lock their doors and huddle together.

                                                           72.


EXT. ROAD.

The Barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over,
having a merry time.  They surround the car and press their
faces against the window, flattening their features, making
menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside.  We see this
from the point of view of the MAN and WOMAN inside the car.
CLYDE pulls out a gun, makes as if to shoot, but he is
kidding.  They all laugh uproariously, especially BUCK who
is delighted with CLYDE's prank.  All of this we see in
pantomime from inside the trapped car.

EXT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, get out!  Get out of there,
            I said.

They come out, hands held high, shaking with fear.  They
have practically turned to jelly.

                         CLYDE
                   (ordering them into
                   the other car)
            Get in here.

INT. OTHER CAR.  DAY.

They get in and the gang gets in.  Seven people are now
jammed inside.  CLYDE drives, BONNIE next to him, C.W. next
to her.  In back, BLANCHE, then EUGENE with VELMA (of
necessity) sitting on his lap, and then BUCK.  As will be
seen, the reason the Barrows have kidnapped the couple is
simply that they wanted company.  Living as they do, seeing
only each other day after day, they long for diversion and
new faces.  So the atmosphere in the car will shortly change
to one of friendliness and jollity, and it will get
progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance
the time.  As the car starts up at the beginning, however,
the MAN and WOMAN are terrified.

                         BUCK
            What's your name?

                         EUGENE
                   (hesitantly)
            I'm Eugene Grizzard.

                         VELMA
            I'm Velma Davis.

                                                           73.


                         BUCK
                   (just as friendly as
                   he can be)
            Well, howdy!  We're the Barrow gang.
            That there is Clyde drivin' and I'm
            Buck.

The MAN and WOMAN almost faint from fear; clutch at each
other.  The gang all laugh at this.  VELMA and EUGENE begin
to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the
Barrows are friendly to them.

                         BONNIE
            Look, don't be scared, folks.  It
            ain't like you was the law.  You're
            just folks like us.

                         EUGENE
                   (agreeing over-enthusiastically)
            Yeah, yeah, that's the truth.

                         CLYDE
            I expect you been readin' about us.

The MAN and the WOMAN answer simultaneously with what they
think is the right thing to say under the circumstances.

                         EUGENE
            Yes.

                         VELMA
            No.

They glare at each other.

                         EUGENE
                   (meaningfully)
            Yes, Velma, we have too.

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing at the contretemps)
            Well, you two must be in love, I bet.

EUGENE and VELMA blush, get shy for a second.  BONNIE smiles.

                         BUCK
                   (gleefully, clapping
                   his hands)
            Well, when you gonna marry the
            girl, boy?

Everyone chuckles heartily.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           74.


INT. CAR.  LATER.

--still driving, same positions, but some time has elapsed.
The atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives
are enjoying their new friends.  As the scene starts, BUCK
is finishing his joke.

                         BONNIE
            So then she drinks her milk down
            again, every drop.  And she looks
            over at her son and says, "Son,
            whatever you do, don't sell that
            cow!"

The couple laughs with great amusement, but everyone else in
the car doesn't laugh--this is the tenth time they've heard
the joke.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. OF CAR.

--getting on toward evening.  All are thoroughly relaxes and
chatting.

                         BONNIE
                   (to Velma)
            How old are you, honey?

                         VELMA
            Thirty-three.

A sudden look of surprise registers on EUGENE's face.

INT. OF CAR.  NIGHT.

It is now night.  Everyone inside the car is eating.
Apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food.
In the crowded interior, it is like a party--food is being
passed back and forth, laughter and gaiety, increasing
warmth between the couple and the Barrows.  The car has
become a little society on wheels, dashing through the black
night down the highway.  Inside there is a small world of
happiness and fun.

BUCK is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks
around the car.

                         VELMA
            Now I ordered some French fries,
            didn't I?

                                                           75.


                         BUCK
                   (passing her some)
            Yeah, here you go.

                         CLYDE
            Take it easy on those French fries,
            Velma.  Ain't that right, Eugene?

                         EUGENE
                   (studying his hamburger)
            This isn't mine.  I ordered mine
            well done.  Who's got the other
            hamburger?

Close-up.  C.W. who has already taken a bite of the other one.

                         C.W.
            Oh, is this supposed to be yours?

He extends the bitten burger out to EUGENE.

Full shot.

                         EUGENE
            That's okay, forget it.

CLYDE laughs at this.

                         BUCK
                   (chewing)
            Haw!  I sure am havin' a good time!
            How 'bout you folks?  Ain't you
            glad we picked you up?

                         CLYDE
                   (laughing)
            Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up
            with us.

That idea strikes everyone as being very amusing.

                         EUGENE
                   (laughing)
            Ha!  Wouldn't they be surprised
            back home to hear that?

                         VELMA
            Yeah.  What would Martha and Bill
            say if they heard that?
                   (she roars with laughter)
                         (MORE)

                                                           76.


                         VELMA (CONT'D)


                         EUGENE
            Lordy!  They'd throw a fit!
                   (roars with laughter)


                         BONNIE
                   (laughing)
            What do you do, anyway?

                         EUGENE
                   (as his laugh begins
                   to fade)
            I'm an undertaker.

Suddenly everyone freezes.  A shudder, as if the cold hand
of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car.  The
atmosphere changes to cold, deadly, fearful silence in
exactly one second.  It is a premonition of death for the
Barrows, and they react accordingly, BONNIE especially.

Close-up.  BONNIE.

                         BONNIE
                   (tautly, in a flat voice)
            Get them out of here.

EXT. ROAD.  NIGHT.

The car brakes to a sudden stop.  The rear down is opened,
the MAN and WOMAN flung out into the darkness.  The car
drives off into the lonely night.

From this point on, the audience should realize that death
is inevitable for the Barrow gang, that it follows them
always, that it waits anywhere.  It is no longer a question
of whether death will come, but when it will.

EXT. WOODS.  MORNING.

Moving with CLYDE he tears through the brush, snagging his
clothes, calling BONNIE's name.  CLYDE's search is so
desperate here that for a moment we might think he is
fleeing from something rather than looking for something.

In a moment he emerges onto the road.  The car, with C.W.
driving, and BUCK and BLANCHE beside him, is patrolling
slowly up ahead of him.

CLYDE spots it and runs toward it.  Hold on this angle until
he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board.

                                                           77.


Moving shot.  Car.  Morning.  CLYDE, now on the running
board, his head poked into the car, his face apple red and
sweating.

                         CLYDE
                   (breathing heavily)
            ...see anythin', Buck?

BUCK is shocked at his brother's desperation, but makes no
overt comment on it.

                         BUCK
            --not yet, boy.

                         CLYDE
                   (with an edge of
                   paranoia, as if the
                   three of them might
                   be withholding
                   something from him)
            --and nobody saw her leave, or
            heard anythin'
                   (almost a threat)
            ...C.W....?

EXT. CAR.  MOVING SHOT.  DAY.

CLYDE gets the point.  For the very first time we see CLYDe,
the leader, helpless as he hangs onto the running board.

                         CLYDE
                   (lamely)
            ...Well, where do you think she
            could've gone?...Buck?...Buck?

                         BUCK
                   (amazed and a little frightened)
            Jesus, I don't know...

CLYDE looks helplessly at his brother, then drops off the
running board and continues on foot, running along, scanning
the fields--the car keeping up beside him as he runs and we
truck before both car and CLYDE.

Angle on car through windshield.  Reaction shot.  Day.  BUCK
turning to BLANCHE, shrugging his shoulders, speechless.

Reverse angle through the windshield.  Day--at CLYDE, who
has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly,
almost--from car's POV, a little comically.

                         CLYDE
            There!  There!  There!

                                                           78.


He starts running off into a cornfield.

Another angle--picking up CLYDE as he kicks his way into the
cornfield, knees pumping high, knocking down the stalks.  He
stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted, takes it and
moves on.

Still another angle as CLYDE has picked up a freshly beaten
trail through the cornfield.  He picks up one of BONNIE's
scarves, now.  As he runs on, he clears a knoll and BONNIE,
her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes
into view.  She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off,
looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper
sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost
clothing.  CLYDE screams, "BONNIE." She apparently doesn't
hear.

Angle on cornfield.  Day.  As CLYDE gets closer.  BONNIE
herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting
completely, the remaining clothes spilling out.  There is a
real chase where they each try to get the advantage.  CLYDE
is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble
cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn.
Finally CLYDE catches up.

Extreme close-up.  BONNIE & CLYDE.  Day.  As they tumble
into the stalks of corn, mowing them down.

                         BONNIE
            Leave me alone!  Leave me alone!

                         CLYDE
                   (holding her, kissing
                   her frantically)
            Hey...hey, hey, baby, hey, Bonnie,
            hey baby...
                   (calming her down)
            ...Hey, hey now...just where did
            you think you were goin'?...

BONNIE doesn't answer.

Up angle.  POV CLYDE.  As he's momentarily distracted by
BUCK's laughter as he's in the cornfield picking up BONNIE's
clothing.  CLYDE waves an impatient it's all-right-wave.  He
turns back to BONNIE who he still holds tightly.

                         CLYDE
                   (still frantic)
            --Huh.  Bonnie?  Where?  Where?

                                                           79.


                         BONNIE
            I don't know!  You're hurting me, I
            was just scared is all...and my
            mama's been on my mind, and she's
            gettin' so old...

BONNIE hesitates, beginning to feel a little foolish now.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, don't ever leave without
            sayin' somethin'.  You really
            scared me, Bonnie.

                         BONNIE
            But I mean it, though.  I want to
            see my mama.  Please, Clyde.

Two shot.  BONNIE and CLYDE.  Day.

                         CLYDE
                   (enormously relieved,
                   kissing her)
            Okay, sweetheart.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SIDE OF A ROAD.  VERY LONG SHOT.  DAY.

--of three or four cars parked on the side of a road in
Texas.  A light rain is falling.  There are a lot of people
gathered around, but the sound is an indistinct mixture of
talk, laughter, etc.

There follows a quick montage of cuts which isolate specific
moments in the family reunion, thereby implying the entire
tone of the proceedings.  The sense of family pervades.

Montage.  BONNIE and MOTHER.  BONNIE's mother, an old woman,
grabs her and hugs her and cries.

Montage.  BONNIE, CLYDE, MAN.  A man, an uncle perhaps,
stands with BONNIE and CLYDE, arms around them both, hugging
them to his sides tightly.

Montage.  BONNIE and sister.  BONNIE's sister hands them a
scrapbook of clippings.

                         SISTER
            Here you are, we been cuttin' and
            pastin' everything we could find
            about you in the papers.

                                                           80.


CLYDE, BONNIE, BUCK and BLANCHE all look at the scrapbook.
We see a page of it, showing newspaper articles with the
photographs the gang took back at the motel.

                         BUCK
            Hey look, here's that one I took of
            you, Clyde.  That came out just fine!

Montage.  BONNIE, CLYDE, MAN.  BONNIE and CLYDE are posing
for a comic snapshot.  A silly looking male relative is
posing, pointing a gun at them.  They have their hands in
the air and are grinning broadly.  (The effect should be
funny and simultaneously frightening.)

Montage BUCK, SMALL BOY.  BUCK is sitting with a little
four-year-old on his knee, bouncing him up and down and
singing.  Both are having a fine time.

                         BUCK
                   (singing)
            Oh, Horsey! keep your tail up, keep
            yer tail up, keep yer tail up, Oh,
            Horsey! keep yer tail up, Why don't
            you make it rise.

Montage--C.W.  A hand off camera thrusts a sandwich at C.W.
He opens the bread to see what's inside it, then eats it.

Montage--BONNIE & SISTER.  BONNIE sits stock-still while her
sister gives her a permanent in the back seat of a car.  He
sister pauses, setting down the curling iron.  She strokes
BONNIE's yellow head with her hand, as though she were a
wild animal that had paused long enough to be petted.
BONNIE turns to see her sister's expression.  They embrace.

Montage--Family picnic--Favoring CLYDE, MOTHER & BONNIE.
CLYDE, in his best theatrical manner has been playing host
in the sand pile, perhaps using some sort of towel across
the arm or around the middle.  The party is beginning to
break up now as used paper plates and crumpled napkins are
blowing across the sand and the group is finishing up on
Eskimo pie.

                         BONNIE'S UNCLE
                   (rising)
            Where y'all headed from here?

                         CLYDE
                   (right back)
            I don't know, what y'all got in
            mind?  At this point we ain't
            headin' to anywhere, we're just
            runnin' from.

                                                           81.


CLYDE laughs, in fine spirits.

Reaction--BONNIE.  She doesn't.

                         BONNIE'S SISTER'S VOICE
            C'mon, down, Litte Tom!  We're
            goin' home.  Little Tom?  Mathew,
            fetch Little Tom.

                         BONNIE
            Don't go yet, Mama.

                         UNCLE'S VOICE
                   (cutting in)
            C'mere, c'mere you little corn
            roller.

Wide angle.  As Uncle sweeps up the laughing little Tom.

Reaction--BONNIE.  BONNIE turns with increased urgency to
her MOTHER, who, having been hefted to her feet by BONNIE's
sister, has turned to CLYDE, who gives her a big, boyish hug.

                         MOTHER
            ...you know, Clyde, I read about
            y'all in the papers and I'm jes'
            scared.

                         BONNIE
                   (to Clyde)
            Sugar, make mama stay a while yet.

                         CLYDE
                   (ignoring Bonnie, as
                   does Mother,
                   ebulliently, even joshing)
            Now Mrs. Parker, don't y'all
            believe what you read in the papers!
            That's the law talking there.  They
            want us to look big so's they'll
            look big when they catch us.

He knows he's stumbled onto the wrong thing, but he bounces
right along--it's his style.

                         CLYDE
            --and they can't do that.  Why, I'm
            even better at runnin' than robbin'
            banks--aw shoot, if we done half
            the stuff they said we did, we'd be
            millionaires, wouldn't we, old
            sugar.
                         (MORE)

                                                           82.


                         CLYDE (CONT'D)
                   (he turns to Bonnie
                   who continues to
                   stare at her Mother)
            And I wouldn't risk Bonnie here
            just to make money, uncertain as
            times are.  Why one time I knowed
            of a job where we could of make
            $2000 easy, but I saw the law
            outside and I said to myself, why
            Bonnie could get hurt here.  So I
            just drove right on and let that
            money lay.

He waits for a response, as does BONNIE.  BONNIE's MOTHER
smiles, a little abstractedly.

                         MOTHER
            ...Maybe you know the way with her,
            then.  I'm just an old woman and I
            don't know nothin...

She trails off, looking nowhere in particular.  CLYDE takes
her reaction to mean that he's overwhelming her with his
confidence, and continues to pour it on.

                         CLYDE
            We'll be quittin' this just as soon
            as the hard times is over, Mother
            Parker, I can tell you that.  Why
            me and Bonnie were just talkin' the
            other day and we talked about when
            we'd settle down and get us a home,
            and Bonnie said, "I couldn't bear
            to live morn'n three miles from my
            precious mother." Now how'd you
            like that, Mother Parker?

BONNIE's MOTHER has undergone a funny sort of transformation
during CLYDE's speech--as if something had suddenly come
into focus before the old woman's eyes.

                         MOTHER
            Don't believe I would.  I surely
            don't.
                   (to Bonnie)
            You try to live three miles from me
            and you won't live long, honey.
                   (to Clyde)
            You'd best keep runnin' and you
            know it, Clyde Barrow.
                   (matter of fact)
            Bye, baby.

                                                           83.


She hugs BONNIE who can barely respond.  We move in for a
closeup of BONNIE as her various relatives, young and old
come by to squeeze, kiss and hug her with a chirpy little
chorus of Bye, Bonnie!  Bye, Bonnie, bye, bye, bye.

                                            DISSOLVE:

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  PLATTE CITY, IOWA.  DAY.

Hold on the outside long enough to see the unusual
structures: two little motel cabins connected by two
identical garages, an entirely symmetrical structure.

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL BEDROOM.  WITH BONNIE.  DAY.

--as she tries, against heavy odds, to file and trim her
nails in a corner of the room.  The odds are; CLYDE on a
uke, b.g., BUCK, and BLANCHE--gathered around C.W. who sits
in the only stuffed chair in the room.  Their o.s.
raucousness is clearly shattering to BONNIE who, at a key
moment in the scene, ends up spearing her cuticle with a
file, spurting a little board and a lot of temper.

Other angle.  CLYDE--BUCK--BLANCHE--C.W.  Day.  A naked
lightbulb (the lampshade has been removed) glares down on
C.W.'s chest--where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed
with a rocco flourish.  BUCK and BLANCHE are vastly amused--
rather BLANCHE takes delight in BUCK's delight.

                         BUCK
            How long have ya had it?

                         C.W.
                   (like some docile
                   animal submitting to inspection)
            --just got it.

                         BUCK
                   (to Blanche, who
                   stares fascinated as
                   one of C.W.'s pectoral
                   muscles contracts and
                   the wings flutter)
            Touch it, honey!  Go on!

BLANCHE squeals with amusement.  BUCK takes BLANCHE's hand
and places it on the bluebirds.

                         BLANCHE
                   (titillated with delight)
            Oh, no, Daddy!  No!

Reaction BONNIE.  Day--as the file digs into her cuticle on
BLANCHE's squeal.  With barely controlled rage:

                                                           84.


                         BONNIE
            What are you all doin'?

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  FAV. BONNIE.  DAY.

                         C.W.
                   (insensitive to
                   Bonnie's stare)
            Playin' with my tattoo, Bonnie.

                         BONNIE
            Well, why don't you all go play
            with it somewhere else?

New angle.  Motel bedroom.  Day.

                         BLANCHE
            What's bothering her?

                         CLYDE
                   (sees something coming)
            Not now, Blanche.

                         BUCK
                   (who doesn't want to
                   be victimized by
                   Bonnie's temperament)
            What's bothering her, Clyde?

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            I said go somewhere else!

She picks up the first three objects she can find on the
dresser and hurls them--an ashtray, a Gideon Bible, and a
flower pot--at the little group.  The pot goes shattering
into the wall.  Everyone ducks.

                         CLYDE
                   (straightening up,
                   matter-of-fact)
            Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a
            chicken place a few miles back.
            Who all wants to go get some food?

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  DAY.

                         BLANCHE
                   (rising from her
                   chair, a little
                   shaken at Bonnie's outburst)
            I sure do.  I'm plenty tired of
            sittin' around here anyway.

                                                           85.


                         BUCK
                   (not making a move to
                   get up)
            You can't drive, honeylove.

                         C.W.
                   (reluctantly)
            I'll go.

CLYDE makes a face to BONNIE pretending there's something
going on between C.W. and BLANCHE.  BONNIE tries to keep
from being amused.  C.W. moves out with BLANCHE.  BUCK rises
to go next door.

                         C.W.
            What's everybody want?

                         CLYDE
            Just five chicken dinners, and get
            somethin' for dessert.

                         BUCK
            See if they got peach ice cream.
                   (he grins and pats
                   his stomach)


All finally exit, leaving BONNIE and CLYDE alone.

EXT. CAR AND STREET.  DUSK.

C.W. and BLANCHE go out.  We go with them.  They get in the
car and drive off.  BUCK enters his cabin.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DUSK.

CLYDE reaches her, and for a moment both stare with fanatic
intensity at each other, BONNIE trying desperately to keep a
straight face.  They are nose to nose, unblinking.  CLYDE
gives her a big raspberry, waggling his fingers in his ears
like a kid.  She laughs.

                         BONNIE
            I hate you all.

                         CLYDE
            I hate y'all, too.

                         BONNIE
            no, I really hate you.

She turns away from him, wilts onto the bed.

                                                           86.


                         BONNIE
                   (eyes brimming)
            Oh, baby, I've got the blues so
            bad...

CLYDE moves behind her, begins to massage her back.  There
is something very delicate about the way he touches her; it
suggests CLYDE's sensitivity to her mood rather than any
degree of physical intimacy.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie?...is it your mama, what
            your mama said?

                         BONNIE
            What mama?...she's just an old
            woman now...I have no mama...

BONNIE rolls over on her back, stares up at CLYDE, tears
splaying across her face from the move.

                         BONNIE
                   (quietly)
            ...so funny...I thought when we
            first went out, we were really
            goin' somewhere...but this is it--
            we're just goin', huh?

She has addressed this last directly to CLYDE, but there is
nothing rhetorical about it--it is a real question.  CLYDE
doesn't answer for a moment.  Then:

                         CLYDE
            Do you care about where we're goin'?

BONNIE clearly finds this hard to say:

                         BONNIE
            Not as long as you care about me.

                         CLYDE
                   (quite simply)
            Why I love you, sugar.

It's the first time he's said it to her, and BONNIE is
overwhelmed.  She wraps her arms around CLYDE's middle, and
snuggles into him, like a child.  Neither we nor CLYDE can
see BONNIE's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest.

                         BONNIE'S VOICE
            --enough to die with me, baby?...
            'cause I think that's where we're
            goin'...I surely do.

                                                           87.


CLYDE is both touched and amused by the plea.  He strokes
her head lightly.  Really meaning it.

                         CLYDE
            --wherever.

                                            DISSOLVE:

INT. CAR.

BLANCHE, her tense and agitated self growing increasingly
more so lately, lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of the
one she has been smoking.

                         C.W.
                   (conversationally)
            You sure smokin' all the time lately.

                         BLANCHE
                   (quick to take
                   offense, snaps)
            So what?

                         C.W.
            Nothin'.

BLANCHE, sick of it all, drops her head in her hand with a
sigh.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, God...

C.W. looks at her, finally decides to say something that
occurs to him.

                         C.W.
            Whyn't you go back home to your papa?

                         BLANCHE
                   (it's been her dream)
            Oh, if I could!  If I could just do
            that one thing!  Oh, there's no
            tellin' why this all happened.  I
            was a preacher's daughter.

                         C.W.
            When church is your pa affiliated
            with?

                                                           88.


                         BLANCHE
                   (much more interested
                   in talking about herself)
            Baptist...oh, and he thought the
            world of Buck, my daddy did, even
            knowing that Buck was serving time
            in jail.  He forgave him for that
            'cause he paid his debt to society.

                         C.W.
            We were Disciples of Christ.

INT. FRIED CHICKEN CAFE.

The camera remains stationary in this scene, in this position.
A lunch counter sweeps down the center of the screen.  We
are at one end of the counter.  In the f.g., a DEPUTY sits
drinking coffee, absorbed in his cup.  In the b.g., at the
other end of the counter, by the Exit door, BLANCHE and C.W.
are being handed their order by the counterman.

                         BLANCHE
            Hey, C.W., I ain't got my money.
            Give me some, will you?

The DEPUTY turns his head and looks over there.  C.W. opens
his jacket to reach in his pocket for money.  As he opens
his coat, his gun is clearly seen tucked in his pants.
Camera zooms in to tight close-up of gun.

Close shot.  DEPUTY--his face tense.  Sound of door closing
shut, as C.W. and BLANCHE leave.

                         DEPUTY
                   (to counterman)
            Get Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

On C.W.'s moonlit chest and face, tattooed bluebirds heaving
and occasionally snoring in the night.  Behind him the room
is dimly lit by flickering candles that are placed out of
sight on the floor.  The shapes in the room--the bed is
gutted and only the box mattress remains--dresser, lamp
shades, etc., are grotesque in the flickering light.  O.s.
sounds of BONNIE and CLYDE, BONNIE giggling and CLYDE
whispering something we can't quite hear.

Move across the room toward the gutted bed.  Move giggling
from the floor beneath the box mattress--for a moment it
should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going
on between BONNIE and CLYDE.

                                                           89.


                         BONNIE'S VOICE
            Ready?

                         CLYDE'S VOICE
                   (a little embarrassed)
            Aw Bonnie--

                         BONNIE'S VOICE
                   (coaxing)
            C'mon!

CLYDE's arm wielding a Tommy gun, clears the bed.  With the
muzzle, CLYDE knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser
overhead, bringing BONNIE and CLYDE into view.

Closer angle mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.  BONNIE lies
stiff as a statue on the white mattress, impeccably dressed
for her funeral.  Candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie
at her head and feet.  BONNIE's hands and face are powdered
and painted a waxen white.  She wears a garish silk bow in
her hair which it, for this occasion, curled like a little
girl's.

CLYDE sits up, beer bottle in one hand, Tommy gun in the
other, derby hat cocked--and just a little unsure of the
whole thing.  He takes a swig--BONNIE stops him, trying
terribly hard not to change her position.

                         BONNIE
            Lie down now, honey.

                         CLYDE
            I've done enough!

Angle on mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.

                         BONNIE
                   (with patience, to a child)
            You have to lie down...it's the
            only way we can tell what we'll
            look kike together.

She giggles again, more than a little gassed herself.  CLYDE
clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down
beside her.  CLYDE is both amused and annoyed.

                         CLYDE
                   (staring up at
                   himself talking with
                   cigar clenched
                   between his teeth)
            Whatta you think?

                                                           90.


                         BONNIE
                   (it suddenly strikes her)
            That's not the right tie!

                         CLYDE
            What?

                         BONNIE
                   (rising, weaving a little)
            You can't wear polka-dots on an
            occasion like this.

                         CLYDE
            Well what--

                         BONNIE
            Stripes.  Don't go away now.

She weaves her way over to the dresser, takes a swig from a
bottle there herself, checks her makeup, and returns with
the tie.  Holding against his chest to try it out she almost
falls into him.  CLYDE steadies her.

                         BONNIE
            Perfect.

She tries to tie it for him, and clearly has trouble with
the knot.

                         CLYDE
            OK, o.k.  If we're gonna do this,
            at least I can tie it myself.  Lie
            down before you fall down.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM--BONNIE AND CLYDE.  NIGHT.

She does, with some play-acting, exaggerated obeisance to
CLYDE's command--reaching up at the last moment like a
zombie and snatching an artificial flower from BLANCHE's hat
which still lies on the dresser.  CLYDE lies down now.  They
look into the mirror again.

                         CLYDE
                   (grudgingly)
            Better?

                         BONNIE
            Much.

This tickles CLYDE despite himself and he laughs--BONNIE
begins to sing to him--performing for both CLYDe and her own
image in the mirror--like some hoydenish vaudevillian.

                                                           91.


During the course of the song she will rise and take CLYDE
with her who finally joins in when they tip-toe over and
begin to serenade C.W.

                         BONNIE & CLYDE
                   (to the lugubrious
                   strains of the Death March)
            "Did you ever think when a hearse
            went by,
            That somebody you or I may die?
            They'll wrap you up in a big white
            sheet
            and bury you down just about six
            feet,
            The worms crawl in, the worms crawl
            out,
            The worms play penuckle on your
            snout.
            Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall
            out,
            Your face turns green and the pus
            runs out.

During this last they have been hovering over C.W.'s
twitching face, like a couple of tipsy ghouls, whisper-
singing into his ears.  C.W. finally blinks, doesn't even
bother to look at them.

                         C.W.
            I'm gonna die if I don't get some
            sleep.  Quit singing that.

Reaction--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.  They smile, go back and
lie down.  Looking at their images:

                         BONNIE
            All right, shut your eyes now.

                         CLYDE
                   (playing along with her)
            No, you first.

                         BONNIE
            One for the money.

                         CLYDE
            Two for the show.

                         BONNIE
            Three to get ready--

                         CLYDE & BONNIE
            Four to Go.

                                                           92.


As they approach four we should feel that somehow when they
shut their eyes, they really will die.  They shut them on
GO, and screen goes black.

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  NIGHT.

Ranged across the lawn are six police cars, loaded with
peace officers.  Four men come out and, guns drawn, walk
cautiously over to the room on the right--BUCK and BLANCHE's.

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  BUCK'S CABIN.  NIGHT.

There is a knock on the door.  They sit bolt upright in bed.
Before BUCK can say anything, BLANCHE puts her hand over his
mouth to shut him up.

                         BLANCHE
                   (calling out)
            The men are on the other side.

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  NIGHT.

The four lawmen, among them the DEPUTY from the cafe, edge
their way across the lawn, past the first garage, past the
second.  Before they reach the door of BONNIE and CLYDE's
cabin, the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire.
One cop is hit and falls, the others run back to the cars
for cover.  BONNIE and C.W. are at the window, firing
steadily.

CLYDE--running into the garage to get the car.  They must
escape.  All they can do is escape, and all they have is
that one car in the closed garage.

Outside.  Two of the lawmen fall to the ground, shot.  As
the remaining two run back for cover, we see a blinding
light rolling up in a space between the six cars.  It is an
armored truck, with mounted guns and and spotlight, advancing
toward the cabin.

Inside the armored truck.  Two men in the seat.  Sounds of
gunshots coming from everywhere, piercing light.  From
inside the truck, we suddenly see the windshield shattered
from bullets fired by BONNIE and C.W.  The driver is hit,
and he slumps over the wheel.  His body hits the horn, which
starts blasting and continues throughout the battle.  The
other man, quickly, ducks under the dashboard for protection.

Inside the garage.  CLYDE standing by the car.  He holds the
Browning Automatic.  The garage door is shaking from the
impact of bullets, shattering.  His gun already firing
(automatic clip) before he gets there.  CLYDE in a crouch
runs to the garage door, flings it up, and runs back inside
the car.  Now the door is open and he can get the car out.

                                                           93.


One hand on the wheel, one hand shooting, he rolls the car
out onto the driveway.  The battle is raging from all sides.

EXT. STREET.

The car stops.  CLYDE keeps shooting.  The door of the cabin
flies open and BONNIE and C.W. come charging out, guns
blazing away.  C.W.  fires the Thompson sub-machine gun,
BONNIE fires two pistols with automatic clips.  They run in
a crouch, tryingto get inside the car in front of their door.
They make it.

Camera pans across the motel to the other door.  It opens,
BUCK and BLANCHE come out, holding a double bed mattress in
front of them for protection.  This makes their running
awkward--the mattress is heavy.  BLANCHE carries the front
end, BUCK the back with one hand, the other firing his gun.
They get halfway to the car and then BUCK is hit, shot in
the head.  He falls to the ground; BLANCHE and the mattress
fall too since she has lost balance.  Both are under the
mattress.

CLYDE dashes out of the car and drags BUCK into the back
seat.  BLANCHE follows, hysterical.  All guns on all sides
are still firing.  They fling themselves into the car and
from a standing start, the car starts out at 60 mph down the
driveway.  One of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a
double-barrele rifle, but the car keeps coming, about to run
him down.  He jumps out of the way and fires at the side.
The glass cracks and we see BLANCHE fling a hand to her
face, which is bloody.  A piece of glass has lodged in her
eye.  We hear her scream.  The horn is still blasting.

INT. THE CAR SWERVING MADLY.

CLYDE manages to keep it on the road.  They drive away.

EXT. STREET.

The police run back to their cars to give chase, calling out
to each other, unable to believe that the gang could possibly
have gotten away.

INT. CAR.  NIGHT.

as it is speeding down the highway.  Crazy, mad hillbilly
music on the soundtrack.  Packed inside this car right now
is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed.
It is hell in there, hell and suffering and pain.  The car
is a complete mess.  C.W. is sobbing.  Everyone is hysterical.
BLANCHE is shrieking with pain and concern for BUCK.  BUCK
is alternating between groaning and passing out completely.
BONNIE is yelling at everybody to shut up.

                                                           94.


Only CLYDE, driving with both hands clenched on the wheel,
is silent.  The car is doing 90.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.  NIGHT.

The car from the outside, a half hour later.  They have
eluded the police.  They are barreling down the road at top
speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes.  It is
the middle of the night, utter silence.  CLYDE stops the
car, points to ca car in a driveway--it is a beautiful,
shiny new and expensive automobile.  C.W. runs out, runs up
the driveway, peers inside, gets in, quietly backs it down
the driveway and pulls behind the gang's bullet-riddled
getaway car.  Suddenly they both zoom off down the road
together.

INT. OF THE NEW CAR.  NIGHT.

C.W. driving alone.  He is crying, mumbling, wiping his eyes
and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the
other.

EXT. RING OF FIRS.  NIGHT.

A wide field in the country.  This is Dexter, Iowa.  It is
quiet.  We see, in a long shot that takes in everything,
that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees, a dense
forest that circles them.  The meadow, however, is large.

The two cars drive into the middle of the field, headlights
on.  They stop and the Barrow gang gets out.  They are in
horrible shape--we can finally have a look at them.  Half-
dressed in their pajamas, bloody, dirty, in tatters.  Those
that can stagger out do so, others are carried.  A far shot
of all this.

Closer shot.  Moving closer to them, we see CLYDE and C.W.
lay BUCK down on the ground.  CLYDE begins to administer to
his wounds as best he can, mostly just wiping him off.  BUCK
is semi-conscious.  All are in a semi-daze.  BLANCHE falls
to her knees, still clutching her eyes.  She is totally
hysterical.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, God, please help us!  Dear
            Father in Heaven, get us out of
            this and Buck will never do another
            bad thing in his life!
                   (she continues
                   moaning, praying, sobbing)


BONNIE walks over to the group, looking at BUCK, C.W. goes
over to her.  Two shot--BONNIE and C.W.

                                                           95.


                         C.W.
            He ain't got a chance.  Half his
            head blown off.

Camera pulls back to take in BLANCHE.

                         BLANCHE
            My eyes!
                   (she SCREAMS)
            God, I think I'm blind.
                   (in the headlights)
            ...light hurts so bad...

BONNIE walks over to the car and comes back with the
sunglasses BUCK had given BLANCHE.  Moving her out of the
glare, she helps BLANCHE put them on.  BONNIE now has an arm
around BLANCHE, and BLANCHE shivers into BONNIE gracefully.
BONNIE is a little repelled by BLANCHE, but comforts her out
of genuine feeling for her.

                         BLANCHE
                   (clinging)
            Please, please get us to a doctor!
            Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.
            We'll die here.

                         BONNIE
                   (helping with glasses)
            --here, hon'.

BONNIE looks silently up to CLYDE.  CLYDE is looking dumbly
down at his mangled brother.

                         BLANCHE
                   (going on)
            Clyde, Clyde, please get us to a
            doctor.

Though BLANCHE cannot see it, CLYDE has knelt down to the
side of BUCK, taking BUCK's hand and with his other hand has
begun smoothing BUCK's hair back, away from the wound.

                         BLANCHE
            He's your brother!

                         BONNIE
                   (gently, knowing
                   CLYDE will not and
                   cannot answer BLANCHE)
            Buck can't be moved, now, hon'.

BLANCHE's answer to this is hysterical sobbing, burying
herself into BONNIE, mumbling half-coherent, muffled prayers
between the sobs.

                                                           96.


With BUCK and CLYDE.

                         BUCK
                   (weakly)
            Clyde?...Clyde?...

                         CLYDE
            Right here, boy.

                         BUCK
            I believe I lost my shoes...maybe
            the dog hid 'em...
                   (he lapses into
                   unconsciousness again)


CLYDE has begun to cry a little, continues to smooth back
BUCK's hair with ritualistic regularity.

Wide angle.  Night.  Camera pulls away, way back to wide
shot of the entire field, showing the group in the center of
the darkness, lit by the headlights.

Match dissolve into early dawn, camera still on the wide
shot.  The field is lighter, though the trees still loom
blackly around it.  The two cars, one almost a shattered
wreck, the other bright and shiny and new, are parked in the
center.  The sky is light, but the trees cast a dark shadow
on the field.  The gang is just sitting around.  BLANCHE
weeping next to BUCK, C.W. sitting on the running board of a
car, staring.  BONNIE standing and smoking.  CLYDE still
with BUCK.

All is quiet.

EXT. WOODS.  DAY.

From the edge of the woods, a man in a white shirt emerges
from behind a tree.  The camera swings abruptly to get him.
He calls out to the gang.

                         MAN
            Surrender!

It is a total surprise.  BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. all grab
their guns and fire several shots; they are not firing the
big guns now, but the pistols.  The man lingers there for a
moment--he looks strange, white, luminous, like an
apparition--and then he vanishes into the woods.  Silence,
long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion.

Then there is a volley of gunfire--a noise so large as to be
almost an impossible sound--coming from the woods, all
around, everywhere.

                                                           97.


A ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods;
from every tree a puff of smoke.  The camera pans in a
circle.  Behind every tree is a man with a gun.  There are
at least 150 people out there--peace officers, farmers with
hunting rifles, kids with squirrel guns, everyone who wanted
to come along and catch BONNIE and CLYDE.  Their number is
so large because this time they want no possibility of the
gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes.

From this point on, the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled
on the sound track.  We hardly hear them at all..it is like
a dream.

Without a word, all of the gang including the half-dead BUCK
making his final effort, scramble for the nearest car.  They
run, throughout this battle, crouched, like animals--their
only thought, to get away, to escape.  To fight it out would
be ludicrous.

From the moment the Barrows start in motion, there is
shooting again from the edge of the woods.  We see them
scrambling towards the car, in an extreme long shot,
surrounded by the ring of smoke.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. OF THE CAR.

All of them inside.  CLYDE is at the wheel.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CAR.

Med. Long shot of the car moving.  The sound track goes to
complete silence.  We see the car looking for an avenue of
escape.  It veers towards a tree, a man steps out from
behind the tree and fires, the car jerks and veers toward
another tree, again a man steps out and fires and so on.
The car performs its eccentric dance, all in utter silence
(no sound of the motor, nothing).  The film should have the
feeling of slow motion, as the car swerves and loops along
the edge of the woods.  Not once do any of the Barrows fire
back.  Another man steps out and aims.

INT. CAR.

Close-up.  CLYDE.  At the wheel-shot in the arm.  He grabs
his arm in pain, loses control of the wheel.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           98.


EXT. CAR.

--out of control (still silent).  It smashes into a tree
stump.  The picture stops, freezes for three beats.  We hold
the image of the moment of crash, with pieces of metal
crumpling and flying into the air, suspended there by the
stop-film.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.

Sound partly up again, but never at its realistic volume.
From inside the smashed car, we peer out the window across
the field and see the other car.  The thought strikes the
audience at the same time it strikes the gang--they must get
to that car.

Med. shot of the second car, sitting in the field, shining
in the sun.  The lawmen also realize what must be done--cut
off this escape.  Though BONNIE, CLYDE and the others are
heading toward it, they suddenly train all their fire on the
car rather than the gang.

The car fills the frame of the screen.  Bullets begin to hit
it.  It starts to quiver under the impact.  For the next
minute, we see the car die in front of our eyes.  We see the
beautiful machine fall to pieces--windows smash, tires torn
apart, body riddled.  The death of the car is as painful to
watch as the willful death of a human being.  The execution
is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the
destruction.

EXT. WOODS.

The camera pulls back, way back and slightly above everything
to reveal the entire field.  On the left of the screen,
BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. are scrambling toward the edge of the
woods.  In the center BUCK and BLANCHE have taken cover
behind a fallen log.  In the foreground, police begin to
emerge from the woods.  The camera zooms rapidly in with
them toward BUCK.  BLANCHE is screaming.

                         BLANCHE
            Don't kill him!  Don't kill him!
            He's dying!

BUCK is making a last feeble attempt.  The zoom continues
past BUCK until it comes tight on his hand, a lawman's foot
steps on his hand.  BUCK falls over.  He dies.  BLANCHE
screams.

                         BLANCHE
            Don't die, Daddy.  Don't die!

                                                           99.


She goes berserk.  Five men, one hardly a teen-ager, grab
her and hold her as she writhes and cries.  She is still
wearing the sunglasses.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS AND STREAM.  BONNIE, CLYDE, AND C.W.  DAY.

They have reached the edge of the woods.  Camera tracks with
them as they run.  From all around come the sounds of the
posse.  The three get in through the pines and come finally
to a deep stream.  They jump in and start across, running
awkwardly in chest-deep water.  They are half way across
when the police appear on the bank behind them, shooting.

Close-up.  BONNIE.  Day--as she is struggling through the
water.  A bullet hits her in the shoulder.  We must see this
bullet clearly, we must see it go in her flesh so that we
can feel it.

Tight close-up of BONNIE's face as she screams.  It is the
first time she has been hurt, and the scream is pure animal
pain.  She cries out.

EXT. STREAM AND CORNFIELD.  DAY.

CLYDE, who has almost reached the other side, comes back and
gets her.  He drags her out of the water and into a cornfield
that starts growing on the opposite bank, C.W. helping.  He
half-carries half-runs with her into the cornfield, as the
field gets deeper and thicker.

They stop for a second.

                         CLYDE
                   (panting, to Bonnie)
            Saw...saw a farm...up ahead...gotta
            get...a car...

He starts to give over the wounded BONNIE to C.W.

                         BONNIE
            Baby, no...

But CLYDE has not heard this last.  Working on pure
adrenaline now, he struggles onward.  Camera tilts up
slightly so we can see CLYDE as he essays his way toward a
farmhouse with a car in the distance.  After a few moments
he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the
stalks as that sound too diminishes,

Full shot.  Cornfield.  Day.  Silence.

                                                          100.


Close.  C.W. and BONNIE.  Obviously some time later.  They
both lie prostrate in the field, listening.  C.W. licks his
lips.

                         C.W.
            Maybe--

                         BONNIE
            Shhh!

They wait for another long moment, picking up only the
tiniest sounds.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally)
            Oh, no.

                         C.W.
                   (nervously)
            What?  What?

                         BONNIE
                   (as though it were
                   the most logical
                   thing in the world)
            I can't die without Clyde.  I just
            can't.

C.W. looks at her as if she's gone crazy.  After another
moment the corn begins to tremble, and we hear the o.s.
sound of an approaching car.

With C.W. Day--tentatively lifting his head up to clear the
corn stalks.  With him we see the car looming larger,
bearing down on us, splitting the corn stalks.  The car
finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of C.W.  BONNIE
is on her feet, and CLYDE tumbles out of the car, practically
before it's stopped, sweeping BONNIE into him.  For a moment
both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of
the car, simply holding onto each other and not moving.

                         C.W.
                   (tugging at both of
                   them frantically)
            C'mon!  C'mon!  C'mon!

                                            ABRUPT CUT:

INT. CAR.  ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER.  DAY.

They have gotten away, but are still escaping.  C.W. is
driving.  He is bare-chested.  CLYDE is beside him in front,
his arm bleeding.  He falls in and out of consciousness.
BONNIE is stretched out in back.

                                                          101.


Her shoulder has been bandaged with C.W.'s shirt.  She is
unconscious.

INT. CAR.  LATE DAY.

CLYDE comes half-awake and looks over at C.W.

                         CLYDE
            Head out, C.W.

                         C.W.
                   (determinedly)
            I'm goin' home to my daddy's farm.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROAD WITH CAMPSITE.  THE SAME EVENING.

C.W. is driving down the road, hell for leather.  Nearing a
campsite, where there are about six Okie cars and pick-up
trucks all loaded down, with a number of poor families
seated around a campfire, cooking.  C.W. jams on the brakes.
He gets out, looking totally exhausted.

Reaction shot.  The faces of the Okies, looking at this
sudden presence in their midst.

Back to C.W.

                         C.W.
                   (about to drop)
            Can y'all spare me a little water?

EXT. CAMPSITE.  FULL SHOT.

One man, the leader of the group, dips a cup of water and
approaches C.W. suspiciously.  He comes close enough to make
C.W. reach out for the water, but withholds it from him.

                         MAN
            Who are you, boy?

                         C.W.
            Name's Moss.

This seems to be enough for the man, who gives him the water.
As C.W. gulps it down, the man begins to circle the car,
peering into it suspiciously.  Suddenly he starts and his
eyes open wide.

                         MAN
                   (in really hushed and
                   reverent tones)
            It's Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.

                                                          102.


He stands there struck dumb, staring.  Those of the others
who have heard him begin to come over.  Without a word they
move quietly to the car and stare in.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is out in the back seat; CLYDE is semi-conscious in
the front seat.  He looks up through half-closed eyes.

EXT. CAR.

We see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring
it to C.W.  He accepts it.

A man rolls a cigarette and lights it.  Then, very gingerly,
as if afraid to really touch him, he reaches through the
window and places it in CLYDE's lips.  It hangs there, CLYDE
unable to drag on it or remove it.

Children peer through the back window.

C.W. finishes his cup of soup.  He hands it and the cup of
water back to a woman in the crowd.

Quietly, moving together, the Okies step back.  C.W. walks
to the driver's seat, gets in and shuts the door.  He starts
up the car.

The people push a bit closer for a last look.  CLYDE, unable
to do more, nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by
way of saying "thank you" t ot the people.  The cigarette is
still dangling from his lips.

The car moves off.  A YOUNG BOY pulls on his FATHER's shirt.

                         BOY
            Who was they, Pa?

                         MAN
            That was Bonnie and Clyde, the bank
            robbers.

A woman, nearby, smiles sweetly.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOSS FARM.  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

The car pulls up outside the slightly ramshackle farm of
MALCOLM MOSS, C.W.'s father, in Arcadia, Louisiana.  It
sits, for a moment, in the dark.  Then C.W. honks the horn.
A few seconds pass, and the porch light comes on.  OLD MAN
MOSS comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness.
He is a fat man with gray hair.

                                                          103.


                         MALCOLM
            Who's there?

                         C.W.
                   (calling back)
            Daddy?

                         MALCOLM
            Who's there?  Who is it?

                         C.W.
            It's C.W.  It's Clarence.

                         MALCOLM
            Clarence!

He runs down the steps, down the path to his son.  They
greet each other, hugging for a second, looking each other
over.

                         MALCOLM
            God, it's good to see you, boy!

He holds C.W. at arm's length to study him, and suddenly he
scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch.

                         MALCOLM
            What's that on your chest?

                         C.W.
                   (puzzled)
            Huh?
                   (realizing what he means)
            It's a tattoo...I'm in trouble.
            I'll tell you about it later.  My
            friends are hurt.  Help me get 'em
            in.

MALCOLM goes to car and looks inside for a moment.  He walks
back to C.W.

                         MALCOLM
            Jesus, what happened to them?  You
            in trouble, son?

                         C.W.
            Yeah.  That's Clyde Barrow and
            Bonnie Parker.
                   (reaction from Malcolm)
            We been shot.  Help me get 'em
            inside.  We gotta help 'em.

They go to the car and drag the unconscious BONNIE out and
begin carrying her up to the house.

                                                          104.


                         MALCOLM
            Why'd you get yourself marked up?
            A tattoo!  What in hell made you do
            a damn fool thing like that?

They reach the house.

                         C.W.
            C'mon, Pa, open the door.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN DEXTER.  DAY.

Although the scene begins with a full-screen close-up of a
newspaper clipping with a photo, it is just a blurry-gray,
crowded scene of BLANCHE's capture.  Really impossible to
make anybody out in the crowd.  Camera stays on photo as we
hear voice over of two men talking: a sheriff and his deputy.

                         BILLY
            I was in the bunch that took 'er.
            See here?  Can you make me out?
            Here I am, see here, right behind
            Joe Boyd here.

                         PETE
            Sure enough, Billy, is that your
            head there?

Camera pulls away, BILLY, a young deputy--cold, intense,
humorless and square, carefully folds up the clipping and
puts it in his wallet.

                         BILLY
            Still can't figure how we let them
            other two get away.

                         PETE
                   (an older, more
                   genial type)
            Yeah, seems as how nobody can get
            'em somehow.

                         BILLY
                   (sullen)
            Yeah...well, maybe this boy'll be
            the one to do it, this Hamer guy.
            Boy if he can't do it, Sheriff,
            ain't nobody but the whole U.S.
            Army can do it.

                                                          105.


                         PETE
                   (with a new note of
                   enthusiasm, gets up
                   and walks to the
                   window--turning to Billy)
            You hear he quit the Rangers on
            account of Texas got that woman
            governor.  Said he wouldn't work
            under no woman.

                         BILLY
                   (respectfully)
            Yeah, that's somethin' all right.
            Say, how many they say he shot
            anyway in his day?

                         PETE
            Sixty-five they say.

                         BILLY
            Son of a sea-cook!

The door opens.  We see, full shot and then fast close-up
FRANK HAMER.  It should be a complete shock to the audience--
this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially
destroyed by BONNIE.

HAMER is dressed in his Ranger outfit and hat, and again he
has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner.
His attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension,
friendly only out of convention, really superior and
contemptuous of lesser workers in his field.

                         HAMER
                   (with politeness
                   arising from condescension)
            Excuse me, am I in the right place?
            Is this Sheriff Smoot?

PETE and BILLY jump up from the chairs and walk over to
HAMER, hands extended.  They are quite impressed by meeting
in the flesh.

                         PETE
                   (mispronouncing his name)
            Frank Hammer.  I sure am pleased to
            meet you!
                   (shakes his hand)


                         HAMER
            Hamer.

                                                          106.


EXT. MOSS FARM.  CLOSE SHOT NEWSPAPER.  DAY.

A coil of rope snaps into and through the paper, splitting
it and revealing C.W.'s startled face.  CLYDE strides the
porch angrily, snapping the rope.

BONNIE and MALCOLM are seated along with C.W.  Through
BONNIE has her arm supported by a sling and CLYDE has his
shoulder bandagedm it is evident by CLYDE's heady indignation
and BONNIE's attentiveness that both are well on the way to
recovery.

                         CLYDE
                   (still snapping rope)
            FLED?  What do they mean, fled?
            How in the nama God could I leave
            my brother to die when he was
            already dead when I left him?
                   (livid)
            He was shot in too many pieces to
            pick off the ground!  Fled...what
            do they know, the papers or the
            police?...

Suddenly he moves upon MALCOLM with enormous intent, as if
by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger
among them, he will justify it all.  MALCOLM momentarily
flinches, then listens with intense deference.

                         CLYDE
            Why, while we were all lyin' around
            here, near dead, they had us
            holdin' up the Grand Prairie
            National Bank!  They hung that one
            on us just for luck, I guess.

CLYDE shakes his head, still thinking this over.  Abruptly,
to BONNIE, with deadly seriousness:

                         CLYDE
            Tell you what.  Soon's we get well,
            we're gonna take that bank!

He breaks into a wicked grin, but then reels, catching
himself on the porch railing.  He's obviously dizzy from
exertion and anger.  BONNIE starts--then sees CLYDE is in
control.

                         CLYDE
                   (remarking on his own dizziness)
            Whooooooo, boy...
                   (kneeling, to Bonnie)
            They don't know nothin'--do they,
            sugar?

                                                          107.


                         BONNIE
                   (assuring him)
            You did all you could, hon'.
            Nobody coulda done more.

C.W. has been studying hard on the torn paper, b.g.  Suddenly:

                         C.W.
            Hey.  How come I'm always called
            the "Un-identified sus-spect?"

Group shot.  Porch.  C.W. has trouble with this last phrase.
BONNIE laughs.  This picks up CLYDE's spirits once more.

                         CLYDE
                   (to C.W.)
            You can just thank your lucky stars
            that's all you are.  So long's they
            don't have your last name, you're
            home safe.

                         MALCOLM
                   (toadying to Clyde,
                   talking to Clarence)
            Mr. Barrow's lookin' out for your
            interests, boy.

                         C.W.
                   (impressed)
            Oh...Hey, Pa, how you like havin' a
            coupla big deals stayin' with you?

                         MALCOLM
                   (friendly as can be)
            Ain't that somethin' for me?

                         CLYDE
                   (back in good mood, expansive)
            Well now, you been real nice to us,
            and I tell you what, let us pay you
            forty dollars for your hospitality,
            what do you say?

                         MALCOLM
                   (protesting vehemently)
            No, no, no.  I don't want your
            money.  I'm just pleased to have
            your company.  Any friend of my
            boy's...

                         C.W.
                   (abruptly)
            Hey, Pa, let's have supper.  I'm
            hungry.

                                                          108.


                         MALCOLM
                   (smiling)
            Yeah...okay, Clarence...
                   (to Clyde)
            You're welcome here, now you know
            that.

INT. MOSS HOUSE.

They go into the house.  Camera goes with them.  As soon as
they are out of earshot from BONNIE and CLYDE, MALCOLM turns
on C.W. displaying an entirely different demeanor from the
one he presented outside.

                         MALCOLM
                   (indicating tatto
                   which flutters
                   through C.W.'s open shirt)
            You look like trash, boy, marked up
            like that.  Cheap trash.

                         C.W.
                   (protesting)
            Bonnie says it looks good.

                         MALCOLM
            Bonnie, what does she know.  She's
            just cheap trash herself.  Look
            what they do to you, and you don't
            even get your name in the paper--
            just pictures put on your skin, by
            "Bonnie and Clyde"--
                   (more to himself)
            --why they're a coupla kids.

                         C.W.
            But, Daddy--

                         MALCOLM
            I'm just glad your ma ain't alive
            to see that thing.

C.W. peeks at it, peering down at his chest, trying to bring
the bluebirds into focus, puzzled.

                         C.W.
            I don't see what's so bad about it...

INT. HOSPITAL.  MED. SHOT OF THE ROOM.

Seated in a soft chair, looking directly at us, is BLANCHE
BARROW.  Her eyes are completely covered with a white
bandage.  She wears a hospital gown.  The room is white and
bright.

                                                          109.


Med. shot.  HAMER in the doorway.  The nurse leaves.  He
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief.
He puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice, afraid she
will remember it from the kidnap.  Quietly, almost on
tiptoes, HAMER walks over to BLANCHE.  He gets inches away
from her face.  She still doesn't know he is there.

                         HAMER
                   (quietly, but
                   suddenly, his voice
                   muffled by the handkerchief)
            Blanche Barrow.

She starts to her feet, then adjusts to his presence.  She
is a bit panicked.  BLANCHE is now a defeated human being.
Her voice and manner bespeak great weariness, sorrow and
still a touch of her old high-strung hysteria.  But most of
that is gone now, like everything else that was really vital
in her life.

                         BLANCHE
            What?  What?  Who is it?

                         HAMER
                   (in a monotone, a
                   relentless questioner)
            You know your husband's dead.

                         BLANCHE
                   (her voice flat and expressionless)
            I know.

                         HAMER
            You're going to prison.

                         BLANCHE
            I know it.

                         HAMER
            Where's the rest of 'em?

                         BLANCHE
            I don't know.

                         HAMER
            Where's the rest of 'em?

                         BLANCHE
            I just don't know.  I don't know.

                         HAMER
            How'd you get in with them?

                                                          110.


                         BLANCHE
                   (starting slow, but
                   warming up to the
                   subject, she begins
                   to talk and talk for
                   the sake of airing
                   her troubles)
            I didn't mean to.  I didn't.  Buck
            said we was just goin' to visit, we
            wouldn't be doin' no robbin' and
            stealin', and then we went to
            Joplin and all of a sudden they
            started shootin'.
                   (hysteria begins to
                   creep into her voice
                   as she relives it all)
            And we run off, God, I was scared.
            And then it was run all the time,
            and I wanted to go, I begged to go,
            but Clyde and Bonnie and C.W.--

                         HAMER
                   (seizing on it)
            C.W.  C.W. who?

                         BLANCHE
            C.W. Moss.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. CAR ON THE MOSS FARM.  A DIRT PATH NEAR THE BARN.  DAY.

It is pouring rain, middle of the afternoon, BONNIE and
CLYDE are inside the car, sitting.  They have lived so much
in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in
it rather than in a room.  There they are themselves.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid
blanket, writing poetry.  She looks like Elizabeth Barrett
Browning.  With one essential difference--her arm is in a
sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder.  CLYDE is
in the front seat, reading a newspaper.  He is also partially
bandaged.  On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which
he eats while he reads.  They look domestic.

                         CLYDE
            Want a ginger-snap, Bonnie?

                                                          111.


                         BONNIE
                   (busy, absorbed)
            No, hum-umm.
                   (then she realizes
                   his nice gesture and
                   smiles warmly at him)
            But thanks anyway, Clyde.
                   (she takes it all in,
                   her situation, and
                   looks content and cozy)
            It's real nice here, just the two
            of us like this.

                         CLYDE
                   (more interested in
                   his paper)
            Uh-huh.
                   (something in the
                   paper catches his interest)
            Look here, honey, remember this?

He holds up the paper; there is one of the photos from the
motel, the one showing BONNIE smoking.  She looks up at it
with mild interest.

                         BONNIE
            Yeah, at the motel.

                         CLYDE
                   (studying the picture)
            You sure don't resemble that no more.

Close-up BONNIE.  She doesn't.  She has become totally
fragile, the essence of herself.  She is writing on a pad.

CLYDE and BONNIE.

                         CLYDE
            What you writin' this time?

                         BONNIE
                   (intensely)
            I'm writing a poem about us.  I'm
            writing our story.

                         CLYDE
                   (this appeals to his ego)
            Oh, are you?  Let's hear it.  If
            it's good, I'll mail it in to the
            Law and it'll be printed in all the
            papers again.

                         BONNIE
            Just let me finish this line.

                                                          112.


She does so.  CLYDE munches a cookie.

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing)
            Okay, here it is.

Close-up.  BONNIE--as she reads intensely.  At the beginning
of this montage, the camera remains on her face.  Behind her
we see the rain on the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (reading)
            "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde"

            You've heard the story of Jesse
            James--
            Of how he lived and died:
            If you're still in need
            Of something to read
            Here's the story of Bonnie and
            Clyde.

            Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow
            Gang
            I'm sure you all have read
            How they rob and steal
            And those who squeal
            Are usually found dying or dead.

            They call them cold-hearted killers;
            They say they are heartless and
            mean;
            But I say this with pride,
            That I once knew Clyde
            When he was honest and upright and
            clean.

            But the laws fooled around,
            Kept taking him down
            And locking him in a cell,
            Till he said to me,
            "I'll never be free
            So I'll meet a few of them in
            hell."

            The road was so dimly lighted;
            There were no highway signs to
            guide;
            But they made up their minds
            If all roads were blind,
            They wouldn't give up till they died.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                          113.


INT. POLICE STATION.  DAY.

The manuscript is lying on the police blotter.  HAMER picks
it up and continues reading it.  He reads it in a halting
way:

                         HAMER
            The road gets dimmer and dimmer;
            Sometimes you can hardly see;
            But it's fight man to man,
            And do all you can,
            For they know they can never be
            free.

            From heartbreak some people have
            suffered;
            From weariness some people have
            died;
            But take it all in all,
            Our troubles are small,
            Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde.

Close-up of a newspaper page.  The poem is printed all the
way down the length of one column.  On the sound track,
BONNIE's voice picks up the recitation:

                         BONNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
            And they have no clue or guide;
            If they can't find a fiend,
            They just wipe their slate clean
            And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

INT. CAR.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE.  DAY.

The day is sunny and we see it through the car window.  She
continues reading, but now she reads it directly from the
newspaper:

                         BONNIE
            If they try to act like citizens
            And rent them a nice little flat
            About the third night
            They're invited to fight
            By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

            Some day they'll go down together;
            They'll bury them side by side;
            To few it'll be grief--
            To the law a relief--
            But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

                                                          114.


BONNIE finishes the poem, as camera pulls back slightly to
show that it is a different day, different clothes and the
bandages are gone.  As she stops, she has an expectant and
somewhat self-satisfied look.

Close-up of CLYDE.  His eyes are wide, his mouth open, his
face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a
giant laugh.

                         CLYDE
                   (in gleeful wonder)
            Damn!  That's me!

A great laugh comes bursting from him.  Camera widens to
take in BONNIE.  She is both startled and delighted by his
response.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            In that poem!

BONNIE giggles.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing; it is
                   all starting to come
                   out now--his
                   realization that he
                   has made it, that he
                   is the stuff of
                   legend, that he is an
                   important figure)
            A sub-gun's rat-tat-tat!
                   (he begins to laugh loudly)
            Right in the paper!

Close-up BONNIE.  Now laughing too, with a great feeling of
joy.

Two shot.  BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         CLYDE
            Jesse James!  You hear 'bout old
            Jesse, now you goin' to hear 'bout
            Clyde!

He puffs up with air and explodes like a steam valve.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Pshhhhhh!

He grabs BONNIE and chuckles delightedly.

                                                          115.


                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Damn, Bonnie!  You musta been one
            hell of a waitress!

Close-up.  BONNIE--laughing, her eyes filled with tears.
CLYDE's hand wipes them away.

Two shot.

                         CLYDE
                   (shaking his head
                   back and forth like a
                   puppy, just so much
                   glee in him that he
                   can't hold it)
            Oooooh, that Clyde!  That's my boy,
            that Clyde!

He looks at her with love and delight, hugs her tightly.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie...
                   (she hugs him back)
            The Poem of Bonnie and Clyde!

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing at the
                   mistake, happy)
            The Story.

                         CLYDE
            The Story of Bonnie and Clyde!  Oh,
            child, you really did tell that
            story!

He pulls her to him, his face inches away from hers, about
to kiss her.  She is waiting, expecting... Suddenly, he lets
out one wild laugh almost into her mouth.

He kisses her.  She kisses back.  They are chuckling,
giggling.  They grow more ardent; they pull back and laugh
again.  They begin to make love.

EXT. ARCADIA STREET.  ICE CREAM PARLOR.  DAY.

Bright afternoon.  Camera across the street from an ice
cream parlor.  Sign about it: "EVA'S HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM."
A large plate glass window fronts the store, and through it
we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths.
Prominent in our vision is MALCOLM MOSS, seated, facing
camera.  He is seated across from another man, but we see
him from the back.

                                                          116.


MALCOLM is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some
hard listening; gesticulating and looking disturbed.  After
a bit of this, he rises from the table and begins walking
toward the door.  The other man rises and turns.  We now see
that it is FRANK HAMER.

MALCOLM and HAMER come out onto the sidewalk, squinting in
the sunlight.  MALCOLM mimes some social pleasantries by way
of saying "goodbye," but HAMER's face shows no emotion of
recognition of the gesture.  He turns and walks away,
walking out of the frame.

MALCOLM stands where he is, in front of the ice cream parlor.
By the expression on his face, we can see that he is rather
disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling
with the problem.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BONNIE and CLYDE.  They lie where they were with one
difference--they are now wrapped in the blanket.  CLYDE's
pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base
of the blanket.

                         CLYDE
                   (chuckling, apparently
                   quite pleased)
            Damn!...damn...damn!

He casts a sidelong glance to BONNIE, wanting some sort of
overt reaction from her.  She's just smiling slightly.
CLYDE's underlying anxiety begins to surface.

                         CLYDE
                   (not looking at her)
            Hey, listen, Bonnie, how do you feel?

                         BONNIE
                   (watching him
                   steadily, her slight
                   smile growing)
            Fine.

                         CLYDE
            I mean you feel like you're s'posed
            to feel after you've uh...

                         BONNIE
            Just.

                                                          117.


                         CLYDE
                   (doesn't know what
                   the fuck to say,
                   desperately wants her approval)
            Well, that's good, ain't it.
            Reason I ask is, I uh... Well, I
            figger it's a good idea to ask.  I
            mean how else do I tell if I did it
            the way...

                         BONNIE
                   (stopping him, with
                   great warmth)
            Hey.  You done just perfect.

CLYDE looks at her for the first time, tremendously relieved.
He can see she means it.  Now his buoyancy, utterly,
unchained breaks through:

                         CLYDE
            I did, didn't I?  I mean I did, I
            really did.  I did it, I did, I
            mean this was my first time and it
            was just like rollin' off a log
            when it comes right down to it, it
            was easy, I mean I didn't even have
            to try...

Lovingly, laughing, altogether overwhelmed with himself,
CLYDE pulls BONNIE into him.  He kisses her, wants to make
love again, but then pulls back and keeps chattering at
sixty miles a minute.  He's waited twenty-three years to
talk about this, and he's got the perfect audience.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KITCHEN.  MOSS FARM.  TWILIGHT.

After dinner.  There are four empty plates, but only C.W.
and MALCOLM in the kitchen.  C.W. is scraping the bottom of
a wilted "EVA'S HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM" carton.  MALCOLM
studies his son's quiet intensity in this direction for a
moment, then moves very close, whispers when he speaks.

                         MALCOLM
                   (whispering)
            Boy, they expect you to go downtown
            with 'em tomorrow?

                         C.W.
                   (out loud, licking
                   his ice cream)
            Who?

                                                          118.


                         MALCOLM
                   (raising his own
                   voice, infuriated by
                   his son's obtuseness)
            Bonnie and Clyde!...
                   (he slaps the carton
                   out of C.W.'s hands;
                   whispering again)
            Bonnie and Clyde.

                         C.W.
            Sure, I always go with them.

MALCOLM thinks hard about this.

                         MALCOLM
            ...better go then, you better go,
            better go...
                   (forcing C.W. to sit
                   at table)
            --but when they get back in the car
            to come on home, don't get in with
            them.

                         C.W.
                   (genuinely puzzled)
            Why, Daddy?

                         MALCOLM
            You just listen to your Pa fer once!
            Cain't you do that?  I'm yore
            Daddy, I'm your kin, not Clyde.

                         C.W.
                   (still confused)
            Well, what should I tell 'em? "I
            can't get back in the car with you?"

MALCOLM is ready to kill--his son's obtuseness and his fear
of CLYDE is whipping him into a quiet frenzy.

                         MALCOLM
                   (squeezing C.W.'s arm)
            No, you tell them nothin', hear?
                   (hesitates, then)
            I made a deal and got you off with
            a coupla years!

                         C.W.
                   (a piercing treble)
            Made a deal with who, Daddy?

                                                          119.


MALCOLM hauls off and whacks C.W. across the top of his head
with the flat of his hand, then momentarily holds his hand
over C.W's mouth.

                         MALCOLM
                   (we can see his own fear)
            ...the law.  Just don't get back in
            that car.
                   (eyeball to eyeball)
            And whatever you do, don't let onto
            them, hear?

C.W. suddenly smiles, as if he knew something.

                         C.W.
                   (expletive)
            Whew!... You think them laws are
            gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town?

C.W. returns to the ice cream carton--MALCOLM lets him,
figuring he better find out what he can.

                         MALCOLM
            What do you think, Clarence?

                         C.W.
                   (matter of fact)
            They ain't gonna catch 'em.  Don't
            matter whether I let on or not.

                         MALCOLM
                   (playing along)
            Mebbe.  Just you be off'n the
            streets of that town when they go
            to get in their car.

                         C.W.
                   (looking directly at Malcolm)
            Nobody catches Clyde.  Clyde's got
            a sense, don't you know that, Daddy?
            Nobody catches Clyde.

MALCOLM knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his
son, fearing that maybe C.W., for all his limitations, has a
sense about CLYDE's sense.  C.W. has finished with the
carton and crumples it, licking the last remnants of cream
off his fingers.

INT. BEDROOM.  MOSS FARM.  NIGHT.

BONNIE and CLYDE's bedroom, the middle of that night.  Both
are wide awake, lying on opposite sides of the double bed.
Both are staring into the night, disquiet.

                                                          120.


                         CLYDE
                   (suddenly)
            Bonnie?  Bonnie, will you marry me?

There is a silent gasp from BONNIE, a barely perceptible
stiffening.  Then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still
staring up at the ceiling.

                         BONNIE
            How could I do that, Clyde?  You
            know it's impossible.  We'd have to
            go to a Justice of the Peace and
            the Justice of the Peace is a
            lawman.  We couldn't even take out
            a license.

                         CLYDE
                   (with a chuckle)
            Hey now, you sound like you been
            givin' it some thought on your own.

                         BONNIE
                   (with a grim irony,
                   her voice getting
                   more and more emotional)
            Oh no, I never gave it thought.  I
            haven't thought about it at least
            ten times a day, I haven't thought
            about it every minute of my life
            since I met you.
                   (suddenly her voice
                   cracks into tears)


She flings herself violently across the bed and buries
herself into CLYDE's chest, her knees drawn up, her head
tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs.

                         CLYDE
                   (a bit startled by
                   this, attempting to
                   hold her, awkwardly,
                   and placate her.  He
                   puts his arm around her)
            Bonnie...are you crying, honey?

BONNIE nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears.

                         BONNIE
                   (her face still
                   buried in CLYDE's
                   chest, she whispers)
            Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

                                                          121.


CLYDE thinks a minute and then grins.

                         CLYDE
                   (in an attempt to be humorous)
            To make an honest woman out of you.

BONNIE is silent.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, in a voice
                   charged with
                   anticipation and dream)
            Clyde...what would you do, what
            would you do it some miracle
            happened and we could walk out
            tomorrow morning and start all over
            again, clean, with no record, with
            nobody after us?

CLYDE thinks about it a minute.

                         CLYDE
            Well...I guess I'd do it all
            different.  First off, I wouldn't
            live in the same state where we
            pull our jobs.  We'd live in one
            state and stay clean there, and
            when we wanted to take a bank, we'd
            go to another state...and...

Suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he
could have, that it was not the answer BONNIE wanted to hear.
He looks down at her, his voice anxious.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Bonnie?

She is silent.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, Bonnie?

But she does not answer.

EXT. ROADSIDE.  EARLY MORNING.

We see MALCOLM jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck
which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                          122.


EXT. ARCADIA STREET.  MID-MORNING.

A street in Arcadia.  The car is parked.  BONNIE and CLYDE
walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and
supplies and put them inside.

                         CLYDE
                   (looking around)
            What happened to C.W.?

                         BONNIE
            He stopped off in that hardware
            store to get light bulbs for his
            daddy.

CLYDE opens the door of the driver's seat and sits down.

INT. CAR.  ARCADIA STREET.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, my feet are sweatin'.

He takes off his shoes.

                         BONNIE
                   (kidding around)
            You plannin' to drive with your
            shoes off?

                         CLYDE
            Sure, why not?

He reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses.
As he goes to put them on, one of the lenses falls out.

                         CLYDE
            Damn!

He puts them on.

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing)
            You gonna wear 'em?

                         CLYDE
            Sure, drive with one eye shut.

BONNIE gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags
and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper.  She
unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it.
It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her
hand, worth about thirty cents.

                                                          123.


                         BONNIE
                   (admiring it)
            Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon?
            Just look here, you can see every
            little fingernail on her hands.

She shows him.

                         CLYDE
            It is a pretty thing, honey.

CLYDE turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music.
They are singing "Little Church in the Valley."  He beats
time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient.
BONNIE puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the
grocery sack.

                         BONNIE
            We got any peaches?  I sure could
            go for a peach right now.

She burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach.  She
takes a big bite.  The juice drips down the side of her
mouth.  She looks beautiful.

                         CLYDE
                   (he stops drumming
                   his fingers, suddenly
                   has an idea)
            Whyn't we do it tomorrow?

                         BONNIE
            Do what?

                         CLYDE
            Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We
            could drive all night and be on
            that golf course tomorrow morning!

                         BONNIE
            You sure you feel up to it?

                         CLYDE
                   (enthused)
            Yeah, why not?
                   (now feeling anxious
                   and excited, he is
                   impatient to move)
            Where is that boy?  He's gone too
            long.

                                                          124.


                         BONNIE
                   (humming to the radio)
            He'll be here.
                   (holding the peach to him)
            You take a bite, hon.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting worried)
            No, it's takin' too long.  What if
            something happened?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin' happened.

                         CLYDE
                   (more urgently)
            Go take a look, see what's keepin'
            him.

Not too delighted with the chore, BONNIE goes off.  We
remain with CLYDE, getting anxious.  The music plays on.
BONNIE comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself.

                         BONNIE
            He ain't there.

CLYDE jumps into action, slams his door.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, let's go.

BONNIE gets in.  They drive off.

INT. STORE.  CLOSE-UP C.W.  DAY.

--hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained
window at them driving away.  His expression is disturbed;
his face half in shadow.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car coming down the road.  Camera sees
from CLYDE's P.O.V.  MALCOLM standing in the road, waving
him down.  The pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked
beside him on a shoulder of the road.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         BONNIE
            What's wrong?

                         CLYDE
            I don't know.

                                                          125.


EXT. ROAD.

CLYDE reaches the spot, pulls off the road and stops the car.
He gets out.  Camera pulls back.  CLYDE talks to the old
man, BONNIE stays in the car.  Cut to a shut down the trench
of the law, tense.

Suddenly, a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the
road from the opposite direction.  HAMER sees it from a long
way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything
pass between him and his quarry.  He decides the time is now.
He leaps up from the trench and yells at CLYDE.

                         HAMER
            Barrow!

The OLD MAN dives under his truck to hide.  The shooting
starts.

We see the chicken truck.  Two men in the front seat.  They
see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in
terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck.
They run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from the
trouble.

The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires
eight-seven shots at BONNIE and CLYDE, giving them absolutely
no chance.  The sound is rapid, deafening.

At no point in the gun fight do we see BONNIE and CLYDE in
motion.  We see, instead, two still photographs cut into the
sequence: one of Clyde, half out of the car, taking careful
dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene:
one of BONNIE, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand
clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can
be.

The noise stops at once.  Utter silence.  It has been a
massacre.  BONNIE and CLYDE never had a chance to return the
gunfire.  We see the car, a complete shambles.  We never see
BONNIE and CLYDE dead, though for a moment we discern their
bodies slumped in the car.

The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with
the opposite side of the road.  Then, slowly, the six lawmen
stand up in the trench.  On the faces of the five deputies,
horror and shock at what they have just done.  HAMER,
however, registers no emotion.  His face is a blank.  He
lights a cigarette.  Slowly, slowly, the five men begin to
edge closer to the car to see the result.  Music, the wild
country breakdown music, begins on the sound track.

                                                          126.


Before they reach the car, the camera swings away from them,
past them, and zooms out and above into the meadow where the
two truck drivers are standing--tiny, distant figures.

The truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera, coming
back to the road to see what happened.  They get closer and
closer to the camera until they have reached a middle
distance and, as they continue to walk at us, it is--

                           THE END

                                                          -
          
                                                           Emil Cioran
          
          EXT. FOREST - DAWN
          
          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
          
          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
          
          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
          
          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
          
          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
          
          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
          
          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
          
          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
          
          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
          
          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
          
          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
          
          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
          
          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
          
          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
          
          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
          
          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
          
                                                                  2.
          
          
          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
          
          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.
          
          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
          
          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
          
          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.
          
          His name is ELI.
          
          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
          
          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
          
          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
          
          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
          
          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
          
          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
          
          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
          
          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
          
          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
          
          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
          
          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
          
          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
          
          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
          
          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
          
          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
          
          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
          
          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
          
          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
          
          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
          
          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
          
                                                                    4.
          
          
                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
          
          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
          
          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
          
          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
          
          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
          
          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
          
          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
          
          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
          
          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
          
          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
          
          KITCHEN
          
          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
          
          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
          
          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
          
                                                                  5.
          
          
          BEDROOM
          
          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
          
          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
          
          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
          
          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
          
          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
          
          He clasps his hands together in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Dear Lord, thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast.
          
          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for the many gifts that
                    you have given me. Thank you for
                    your protection and your guidance.
                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.
          
          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Hey. You hungry?
          
          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
          
          SUNDOWN
          
          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
          
          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
          
          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
          
          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
          
          MANY PAGES LATER
          
          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
          
          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:
          
          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
          
          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
          
          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.
          
          MORNING
          
          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
          
          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
          
          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
          
                                                                  7.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Come on now.
          
          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
          
          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
          
          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
          
          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
          
          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
          
          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
          
          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
          
          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.
          
          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    That's what the last guys said.
          
          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
          
                              ELI
                    Here.
          
                                                                    8.
          
          
          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Could you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.
          
          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
          
          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
          
          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
          
          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.
          
          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
          
                              ELI
                    One good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.
          
          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
          
          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
          
          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
          
          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you got there in the pack?
          
                               ELI
                    Nothing.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Yeah, that's what they all say. How
                    about you take it off real slow and
                    tip it out so's we can take a look?
          
                                                                  9.
          
          
          BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.
          
                              BANDIT #2
                    He's got a gun.
          
                               BANDIT LEADER
                    Shit, it ain't loaded. They never
                    are. Ain't that right, old man?
                        (BEAT)
                    Open the fucking pack or die.
          
                              ELI
                    I can't do that.
          
          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Want us to do it for you? We can
                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.
          
          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
          
                              ELI
                    It's real important you boys listen
                    to me and understand. The man I
                    work for, you do not want to cross
                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with
                    a righteous fury - through me. For
                    I am his faithful instrument.
          
          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What the hell are you, some kinda
                    preacher?
          
                              ELI
                    Something like that.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Well I got news for you, preacher
                    man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
                    yourself to be working for, he left
                    these parts a long time ago. He
                    ain't here to protect your ass. Now
                    take off the pack and set it on the
                    ground.
          
                                                                 10.
          
          
          Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    You fucking listening to me?
          
                              ELI
                    I hear you. You lay that hand on me
                    again and you will not get it back.
          
          The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
          it's supposed to go.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    All right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...
          
          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
          
          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.
          
          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
          
          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
          
          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    What you standin' around for? Kiss
                    him!
          
                              BANDIT #3
                    What's he talkin' about, kiss him?
          
                              ELI
                    He's in shock. He means "kill him".
          
          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
          
          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
          
                                                                    11.
          
          
          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
          
          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
          
                               ELI
                    I told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.
          
          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
          
                              BANDIT LEADER
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli.
          
          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
          
          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
          
          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
          
                              ELI
                    Take it and go on your way. And
                    don't fall in with men like these
                    again. No good can come.
          
          She looks at him, puzzled.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Why are you doing this?
          
          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.
          
          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
          
          LATER
          
          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
          
          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God, the father of mercies, through
                    the death and resurrection of his
                    son has reconciled the world to
                    himself and sent the holy spirit
                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins.
          
          The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,
          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.
          
                              ELI
                    Through the ministry of the church
                    may he give you pardon and peace,
                    and I absolve you from your sins in
                    the name of the father, and of the
                    son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.
          
          He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Thank you. You're... a good man.
          
                              ELI
                    There are no good men on the road.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Where are you going?
          
                              ELI
                    West.
          
                              YOUNG WOMAN
                    Can... can I come with you?
          
          He doesn't even turn back to look at her.
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          He walks on, into the horizon.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
          
          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed.
          
          Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
          
          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
          
          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
          
          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
          
          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
          
          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
          
          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
          
          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
          
          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
          
          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.
          
          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
          
          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
          
          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
          
          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
          
          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
          
          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
          
          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
          
          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
          
          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
          
          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
          
          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
          
          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
          
          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
          
          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
          
          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
          
          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
          
                              ELI
                    You got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here?
          
          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
          
                              ELI
                    Thanks.
          
          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
          
          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
          
          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
          
          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
          
          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
          
                              CHAIN GANG BOSS
                    Come on, move it!
          
          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
          
          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
          
          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
          
          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
          
          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I don't know you.
          
          Eli slowly raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not from around here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    No shit. Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just a customer.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    A customer with a shotgun?
          
          He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You come in here to rip me off?
          
          The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    No. I'll set it down. Okay?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Slowly!
          
          Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You carry a gun in the outland, you
                    don't bring one into town less you
                    live there. Don't you know that?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
                    the road a long time.
          
                                                                    17.
          
          
          This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Show me your hand.
          
                                 ELI
                    I'm not a-
          
          The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    I said show me your fucking hand!
          
          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not one of them.
          
          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What do you want?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm just passing through. I need
                    some help. I can pay.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    What kinda help? And what kinda
                    pay?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm going to get something out of
                    my pack. Okay?
          
          The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.
          
                              ELI
                    I know, I know. Slowly.
          
          The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.
          
                                 ENGINEER
                    Holy shit.
          
          Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with
          awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Where'd you find this?
          
                                                                 18.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Years ago, in the outland back east
                    aways.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Does it work?
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can
                    you do it? I got the cables.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Depends if you also got the coin.
          
          Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer
          picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It'll take a couple hours. There's
                    a bar across the street you can
                    wait, they just opened up.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll wait here.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    You don't trust me?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I don't know you.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY
          
          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
          
          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
          
          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.
          
          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
          
          The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title
          still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by
          the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very
          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
          
          He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.
          
          He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.
          
          REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What is it?
          
          His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Survey team just finished up their
                    inspection. It ain't good.
          
          Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How bad is it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Pressure is down again, and going
                    by the new rod they sank levels're
                    lower than they've ever been.
          
          Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    How long?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A
                    little longer if we're careful. But
                    we're already-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Halve the rations.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We just halved `em last-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So halve them again!
          
          BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody
          questions his orders.
          
                                                                 20.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You're going to have to say
                    something. Folks were none too
                    happy last time. Gonna be worse
                    now, you can count on it.
          
          Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
          
          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.
          
          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.
          
          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It is our faith that sustains us,
                    brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!
          
                                                                 21.
          
          
          The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!
          
          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.
                        (BEAT)
                    Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.
          
          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
          
          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.
          
                              DISCONTENTED VILLAGER
                    We've heard this all before! When
                    are you going to-
          
          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated
          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    I know each and every one of you
                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action. It was faith that
                    built this town - and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead. But
                    it is always darkest before dawn -
                    and the new dawn is coming.
                        (BEAT)
                    May God go with you all.
          
          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
          
          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
          
          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
          
          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
          
          Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
          
          Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    One of the road crews just rolled
                    into town.
          
          Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Of course they did, the bar's open.
                    Outlanders, always looking for
                    answers at the bottom of a bottle.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Not these guys.
                        (BEAT)
                    These guys say they got something.
          
          That gets Carnegie's attention.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get them up here now.
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
          
          The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
          
          A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
          
          Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
          
          Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to
                    see you again! I understand your
                    latest excursion into the outland
                    has been a profitable one?
          
          The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the
          words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.
          
                              HOG
                    We did good.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, let's see, shall we?
          
          Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
          
          BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
          sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.
          
          We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The
          Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.
          
          In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of
          OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...
          
                                                                 24.
          
          
          ...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
          NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS
          AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
          ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No. No. No. No. No.
          
          As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
          frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not here.
          
                              HOG
                    These ain't worth nothin'?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    When you bring me the book I asked
                    you for, it'll be worth something.
          
          The bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation.
          
                              HOG
                    We been doin' this a long time now.
                    Had to make a whole lotta corpses
                    to bring you all these books. You
                    want us to keep at it, reckon it's
                    worth more than a few free glasses
                    of that swill you call liquor.
          
          Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.
          Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
                    once again to take the long view
                    here. When we find this book - and
                    believe me, we will find it - we
                    are going to build a new world. A
                    world far greater, far more
                    righteous than this one. And you
                    and I are going to be perched right
                    on top of it, looking down upon it,
                    masters of all creation!
          
          As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
          with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion
          and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And you know, I think you're
                    absolutely right.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 25.
          
                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    That is worth more than a few
                    glasses of liquor. A whole lot
                    more.
          
          He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze
          like a laser beam, utterly disarming.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The book I want is out there
                    somewhere, just waiting to be
                    found. Once there were millions of
                    copies - you only need to find one!
                    Find it and bring it here. And I
                    promise you, you will be rewarded
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so
          full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want
          to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.
          
          Hog snatches up his empty satchel.
          
                              HOG
                    This better not be bullshit.
          
          He turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following.
          The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains.
          
          Carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Might help if they knew just what
                    they were looking for.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Not one of them can read. How would
                    they even know when they found it?
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    So how's about you just tell me?
          
          Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Two years now you been sending
                    these crews into the outland.
                    Burning up gas we can barely spare.
                    For a goddamn book? What the hell
                    kinda book can be worth all this?
          
          Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge
          sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.
          
                                                                 26.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What about these?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Put them with the others.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          Redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books
          into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books
          as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
          generator, which chugs noisily.
          
          He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take
          a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.

                    What's this place across the
                    street? They got any water?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    We got our own underground spring
                    here. Only fresh water in a hundred
                    miles - if's you can pay for it.
          
          Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun
          inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.
          
                              ELI
                    I'll be back.
          
          Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.
          
                              ELI
                    If that battery ain't here when I
                    get back, I will use this gun on
                    your kneecaps and I will put this
                    building to the torch and I will
                    watch it burn to the ground with
                    you alive inside it. So help me
                    God.
          
          And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a
          hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a
          bedroom, simply furnished.
          
                                                                   27.
          
          
          A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the
          bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her
          face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.
          
          Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the
          mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped
          it's near impossible to see a reflection.
          
          The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed.
          Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Is that you, honey?
          
          Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down.
          Finally Claudia turns to face him.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Something wrong?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    More books came in from the road
                    today.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Oh? It's been a while.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And it'll be a while longer. Just
                    another pile of useless junk. If we
                    don't find the right one soon - if
                    I can't give these people what they
                    want to hear...
          
          Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You'll find what you're looking
                    for. It's out there somewhere. You
                    just have to have faith.
          
          This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith? Is that what you think we're
                    missing around here?
          
          She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet,
          head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My old man used to have faith. He
                    had it in spades. My mother, too.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                    28.
          
                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    You know where it got them? You
                    know where it got me?
          
          He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Faith is for the weak. It's for
                    them out there, the sheep. This
                    world is what you can see and touch
                    and taste. It's what you make it.
                    All these years with me, you still
                    don't have any grasp of that?
                    What's wrong with you, woman?
          
          He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
          
                                 CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
                    scare you. Hey. You okay?
          
          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You just get me all riled up with
                    that kind of talk. It's not what I
                    need from you right now.
                        (SMILES)
                    You know what I need right now?
          
          He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
          
          As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
          
          The original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
          
          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
          
          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Outlander? Let me see-
          
                                                                 29.
          
          
          Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What'll it be?
          
          Eli places the canteen on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    Water.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That's the good stuff. Gotta eat
                    into my own ration to sell it - so
                    I don't sell it cheap.
          
          Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That'll get you maybe half-way.
          
          The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    What about that?
          
          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    That's the best I got.
          
          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
          
          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
          
          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Solara!
          
          A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
          
          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Take this out back and get it
                    filled.
          
          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
          
          He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across
          the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand
          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
          
          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
          
          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms
          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
          
          Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
          canteen away into the back room.
          
                              HOG
                    That was my cat.
          
          Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to
          read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.
          
                              ELI
                    Fine specimen.
          
                              HOG
                    I saw you push him off the bar.
          
                              ELI
                    I didn't push him.
          
                              HOG
                    You raised your hand at him.
          
                                                                 31.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Sorry. It won't happen again.
          
          The bartender looks at Hog nervously.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
          
                              HOG
                    That cat's been comin' in here for
                    nigh on two years. It got more
                    right to be here than you. Who the
                    fuck do you think you are?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't want any trouble.
          
          Hog grabs him by the arm.
          
                              HOG
                    Well, that's too bad, `cause-
          
          Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
          
                              ELI
                    I know you. Murderer of innocent
                    travelers on the road. You're going
                    to spend eternity drowning in a
                    lake of fire for the things that
                    you've done. Did you know that?
          
          The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.
          
                              ELI
                    You go on back to your table and
                    I'll be on my way. All right?
          
          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
          
          Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit.
          
                              BURLY PATRON
                    You push Hog, you push all of us.
          
          Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Cursed be the ground because of
                    you. By toil shall you eat of it.
                    Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
                    for you. From the ground were you
                    taken. For dust you are.
          
          The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?
          
          Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line
          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.
          
                              ELI
                    And to dust you shall return.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants
          bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at
          her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
          
          Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
          Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply
          uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
          
          Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you hear that? What was that?
          
          Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Maybe you should go check.
          
          BEAT. Carnegie keeps listening. Then comes another CRASH.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What in the hell is going on?
          
          He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
          as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment,
          then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
          
          She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,
          feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.
          Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks
          down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.
          
                                                                 33.
          
          
          CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem
          through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE
          MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.
          
          Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly
          on the doors of the upstairs rooms.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Get your asses out here!
          
          ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
          
          SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled
          canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees
          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
          
          She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,
          terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...
          
          Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Stop!
          
          Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He
          turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely
          at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.
          
                                 ELI
                    Go.
          
                              HOG
                        (CONFUSED)
                    ...What?
          
                              ELI
                    It ain't for me to judge you. Your
                    time for that's gonna come. Believe
                    me. Now go on. Get out of here.
          
          Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.
          Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.
          Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN
          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
          
          Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
          
          BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
          
          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
          
          Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry for all the mess.
          
          As he turns and heads toward the door:
          
                              CARNEGIE (O.S.)
                    Hold it right there.
          
          Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.
          
          Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area
          visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the
          other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.
          
          Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So, who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    Nobody. A walker in the outland.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I've met walkers before. Not a
                    particularly civilized bunch. Some
                    have even taken to eating their own
                    kind, did you know that? You
                    wouldn't be one of those savages
                    now, would you?
          
          Carnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    He ain't got the shakes.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          Carnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good. This is a civilized town.
                    Under God. Do you know what that
                    means?
          
          Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It means we have laws here. Laws
                    set down long before any of us ever
                    walked this earth. And one of them
                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your
                    brother. Else you're no better than
                    an animal. And not welcome here.
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So what's your business here,
                    friend? Walkers don't usually come
                    into town less they want something.
          
                              ELI
                    I had a battery needed charging and
                    a canteen needed filling. I didn't
                    come here looking for trouble.
          
          Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, you sure as hell found it. Do
                    you know who I am?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    My name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
                    I own the whole town. You've never
                    heard of me?
          
                              ELI
                    That's you out there on the street.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Remarkable likeness, isn't it?
                    You'd never guess half the men who
                    built it were blind. A small
                    tribute from a grateful people. I
                    was deeply touched.
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You had slaves build you a monument
                    to yourself?
          
          The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around
          the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't call them slaves. That's an
                    old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
                    trying to help these people.
          
          Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the outland the sightless are
                    preyed upon like sick animals. Here
                    at least they're protected. They do
                    the essential work others don't
                    want. And in return they eat, they
                    drink, they survive. Last year, a
                    couple of them even got married -
                    performed the ceremony myself.
                        (BEAT)
                    You see, I'm not exploiting these
                    people - I'm saving them! Any one
                    of them is free to leave whenever
                    they wish. But here they stay. And
                    they thank me every single day for
                    their salvation!
          
          An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like
          an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.
          
                              ELI
                    It's none of my business what you
                    do here. Like you said, it's your
                    town. I just want to be on my way.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What's your name, walker?
          
          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, I guess we just call you
                    Walker. Don't see too many folks
                    your age these days. You lived in
                    the world before? You can read?
          
                              ELI
                    I read every day.
          
                                                37.
          
          
                    CARNEGIE
          That's good. Good man. We educated
          folk, we need to stick together, if
          we're ever going to rebuild this
          world. People like you and me,
          we're the future.
          
                    ELI
          What do you want with me?
          
                     CARNEGIE
          Straight to the point. I like that.
          Fact is, you could be in a lot of
          trouble. This is a peaceful town.
          You walk in here, armed, and the
          next thing a dozen of my good
          citizens are dead. I've hanged men
          for less. I could hang you.
              (BEAT)
          Or, you could come work for me.
          
                    ELI
          What?
          
                    CARNEGIE
          I never once saw anyone handle
          themselves the way you did down
          there in that bar. I don't know
          where you learned it, but I sure as
          hell could use it.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not interested.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          People who work for me can live
          better than any walker ever
          dreamed. Real beds, clean water,
          hot food. Women, even. You could do
          a lot worse, my friend.
          
                    ELI
          I'm not your friend. And I'm not
          staying. I got someplace I need to
          be. Out west.
          
                    CARNEGIE
          West? There is nothing west. It's
          all gone, a long time ago.
          
                    ELI
          I've been told different.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    By who?
          
          Eli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    All right, look. I'm going to make
                    you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
                    night, think it over. Try a little
                    local hospitality. We'll talk again
                    in the morning. If you're still not
                    interested, you're free to go. No
                    hard feelings.
          
                              ELI
                    Thank you for your offer. But I'd
                    prefer to just leave right now. So
                    you can either let me out of here,
                    or I can kill my way out.
          
          The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears
          unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Let him go.
          
          The gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
          
          The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His
          heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.
          
                              ENGINEER
                    Oh, shit...
          
                              ELI
                    How's my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's, uh... it's gonna take a
                    little longer than I thought.
          
                              ELI
                    How much longer?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's gotta charge overnight. You,
                    uh, you can always stay here in
                    town, pick it up in the morning.
          
          Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          
                              ELI
                    You remember what I said would
                    happen if I came back here and you
                    didn't have my battery?
          
                              ENGINEER
                    It's right here! It's just gonna
                    take a while longer. I swear.
          
          Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's
          pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one
          of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN
          HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.
          
          Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind
          him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off
          as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I knew you'd reconsider.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah? How'd you know that?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    None of the walkers I've seen come
                    here from the outland were ever
                    what you'd call smart. I mean all
                    those years out there alone on the
                    road, some with their brains half-
                    fried from eating each other - it's
                    understandable why you people
                    aren't the brightest bulbs in the
                    box. But I never met one so dumb
                    that he'd turn down a meal and a
                    bed if it was offered.
          
                              ELI
                    So you didn't send someone across
                    the street to the engineer?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Engineer? I don't know what you're
                    talking about. If there's something
                    wrong, maybe I can help.
          
          Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.
          
                                                                 40.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    This is Redridge. He's kind of my
                    right-hand man around here.
          
          Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
          steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He'll show you to your room.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
          
          It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
          less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Enjoy your stay. There'll be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night. If you need anything.
          
          Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
          
          He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
          
          A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
          
                              ELI
                    Hello?
          
          The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I have this for you. Water for
                    washing and some food.
          
          Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well... are you going to take it?
          
                              ELI
                    Oh. Thank you.
          
          He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
          
                                                                 41.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're very welcome.
          
          We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It'll be dark soon.
          
          She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
          room is lit by its flickering glow.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Can I get you anything else?
          
                              ELI
                    No, thank you.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well. Have a good night.
          
          As she turns for the door:
          
                              ELI
                    You're Carnegie's woman?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Why do you ask?
          
                              ELI
                    Just making conversation is all.
                    Haven't had one of those in a
                    while. Not a real one, leastways.
          
          Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He found me in the outland. I was
                    sixteen, my family had been...
                    well, they were gone. There was
                    just me and my baby.
          
                              ELI
                    You had a baby?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'd met some men on the road. Bad
                    men. They...
          
          BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
          Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
          
                              ELI
                    It's all right.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I was on the road for a year after
                    that. I couldn't feed myself, let
                    alone my little girl. And then Bill
                    found us and he promised he'd take
                    care of us. He told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe. And he did. He did all that.
                    He built this whole town. He kept
                    us safe. And he raised that child
                    like she was his own. He's been so
                    good to both of us. He saved us,
                    really.
          
          There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
          there is more to the story than she is telling.
          
          Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to eat some?
          
          She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
          
                              ELI
                    When did you go blind? In the war?
                    You get caught in a flash?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No, I was born this way. I think
                    I'm lucky like that.
          
                              ELI
                    Lucky?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    It's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.
          
          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Thank you. I enjoyed our
                    conversation.
          
                                ELI
                    So did I.
          
          Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?
          
          A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    He wanted to talk.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh? What about?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Nothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He tell you anything about him?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    No. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Yeah, I got that.
          
          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What makes you say that?
          
                                                                44.
          
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Just strikes me as the kind of man
                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once it's set.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, we'll just see about that.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You saw him. He's not like the
                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Who said anything about me?
                        (BEAT)
                    I'm sending Solara.
          
          Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You're doing what?
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know how often these walkers
                    get laid? Never. Least not by
                    anything living or willing. Girl
                    like her can be very persuasive.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    You can't send her in there with
                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You went in there readily enough.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    That's different. Solara's just a
                    child, she can't-
          
          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as
                    the rest of us.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    By working as a whore? That's all
                    you think she's fit for?
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We've each been given a talent to
                    help us make our way in this world.
                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell
                    is.
          
          Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What kind of a man are you?
          
          Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm the kind of man who'd pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road, a
                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd
                    be just another no-eye, lying dead
                    in the outland, picked clean by the
                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others. That's the
                    kind of man I am!
          
          He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I don't live without fear. I
                    haven't for a long time now.
          
          Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Where are you going?
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    I'm not going to let you do this.
          
          Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    You're not going to let me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Nobody tells me what I can and
                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
                    built this world, and I am God
                    here! So don't go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans. You know
                    how this works. Solara goes against
                    me, you get hurt. You go against
                    me, she gets hurt.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
          He releases his grip on her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So let's not see anybody get hurt.
                    Okay?
          
          He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.
          
          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.
          
                               ELI
                    Come in.
          
          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
          
          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Hi. Can I come in?
          
                              ELI
                    Someone was already here with food
                    and water. I got everything I need.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that?
          
          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's too bright in here. Mind if I
                    turn it down a little?
          
          She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's better. I'm Solara. You're
                    Walker, right?
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
                              ELI
                    No. My name's Eli.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That short for something? Elias?
          
                               ELI
                    Elijah.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Elijah. I never heard that one
                    before. It's kinda cute.
          
          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.
          
                              ELI
                    Look, I don't mean to be rude. But
                    I'm really not interested.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You sure about that? It gets mighty
                    lonely out there on the road.
          
          She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you're worried about money, this
                    is all paid for. The whole night.
          
                              ELI
                    It's not that. You're a very nice
                    girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
          
          She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
          buttons of his shirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They're all that kind of man.
          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
          
                               ELI
                    I'm not.
          
          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They told me you were crazy. Maybe
                    they were right.
          
                                                                 48.
          
          
          Eli opens the door for her.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Good night.
          
          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Please don't make me leave. I have
                    to stay the night. If I don't...
          
                              ELI
                    If you don't, what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He'll hurt my mom.
          
                              ELI
                    Who will? Carnegie?
          
          She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe he and I oughta have words.
          
          He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Please, don't!
          
                              ELI
                    He's hurting you. He's hurting your
                    mother. He's-
          
                              SOLARA
                    He's my dad.
          
          BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Look, if you want to help me, just
                    let me stay here tonight. We don't
                    have to do anything. I'll sleep on
                    the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
                    dad that we had a good time. I'll
                    be no trouble, I swear.
          
          She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the
          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to have a conversation?
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.
          
          LATER
          
          Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At
          first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.
          
                                ELI
                      You know, you don't have to be
                      afraid of me. What happened down
                      there in the bar...
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm not afraid of you. I know you
                      didn't start that trouble. When I
                      first saw you, I knew you weren't
                      the type to go looking for it.
          
                                ELI
                      How'd you know that?
          
                                 SOLARA
                      My mom says I'm a good judge of
                      character. She says I can read
                      people. That I know a good man when
                      I see one.
          
          She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.
          
                                SOLARA
                      So... you're pretty old, right?
          
          Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.
          
                                SOLARA
                      I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
                      seen too many people your age. How
                      old are you exactly?
          
                                ELI
                      You know, I don't rightly remember.
          
                                SOLARA
                      But you're old enough. I mean, you
                      remember what it was like? In the
                      world before?
          
          Eli nods.
          
                                SOLARA
                      What was it like?
          
          Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.
          
                                                                    50.
          
          
                               ELI
                    Better than this.
                        (BEAT)
                    People lived longer back then.
                    Longer than me. Some were more than
                    a hundred years old.
          
          Solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Come on.
          
                              ELI
                    I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
                    not the same. If you're sick or
                    you're weak or you're old you won't
                    last long out on the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So how come you have?
          
          BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?
          
                              ELI
                    Can I read you something?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait. You can read?
          
          Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.
          
                              SOLARA
                    And you have a book?
                              ELI
                    Not just any book.
          
          For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.
          
          Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he
          finds the passage he's looking for.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord is my shepherd. I shall
                    not want. He makes me lie down in
                    green pastures. He leads me beside
                    still waters. He restores my soul.
                    He leads me in the paths of
                    righteousness.
          
          ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Though I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil. For you are with me. Your rod
                    and your staff, they comfort me.
                    You prepare a table before me in
                    the presence of my enemies. You
                    anoint my head with oil. My cup
                    runs over. Surely goodness and
                    mercy shall follow me, all the days
                    of my life. And I will dwell in the
                    house of the Lord forever.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's beautiful. Did you write
                    that?
          
                                ELI
                          (SMILES)
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What book is it from? Is it poetry?
          
                              ELI
                    I guess you could think of it that
                    way. It's from the Holy Bible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never heard of it. What's it
                    about?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?
          
                              ELI
                    It's about love, and forgiveness,
                    and life and death, and mercy, and
                    revenge, and the beginning and the
                    end of the world. I guess it's
                    about a little bit of everything.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Can I see?
          
          She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? I'm not going to do anything.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
                    this book. I can't trust it with
                    anyone. Not even for a while.
          
                                                                 52.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's so special about that book?
          
          BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
          the beat-up leather cover.
          
                              ELI
                    It's the last one. There are no
                    other books like this. All the
                    others are gone - destroyed by the
                    war or in the burnings that came
                    after. This is the only one that
                    survived until now. The last one
                    anywhere.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How can you know that?
          
                               ELI
                    I just know.
                        (BEAT)
                    For a long while after it happened,
                    I just wandered on the road like
                    most everybody else. There were
                    still a lot of people around back
                    then, in the beginning. I didn't
                    really know what I should do or
                    where I was going. I was just
                    moving from place to place, trying
                    to stay alive. And then one day I
                    heard this voice. I don't know how
                    to explain it, it's like it was
                    coming from inside me. But I could
                    hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
                    can hear you talking to me now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What did it say?
          
                              ELI
                    It led me to this place, I don't
                    really know where. And I found this
                    book buried deep under some rubble.
                    No way no-one was ever going to
                    find it if they didn't know exactly
                    where to look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But you knew because the voice told
                    you?
          
                              ELI
                    That's right. And that voice told
                    me to carry the book west.

                               ELI (cont'd)
                    It told me that a path would be
                    laid out before me, that I'd be led
                    to a place where this book would be
                    safe. It told me I'd be protected
                    against anyone or anything that
                    tried to stand in my way. If only I
                    would have faith.

                    That was twenty-five years ago. And

                              SOLARA
                        (SKEPTICAL)
                    Because a voice you heard in your
                    head told you to.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it.
                    I know what I heard.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So who was it? The voice?
          
          BEAT as Eli considers his answer.
          
                              ELI
                    A very important, very powerful
                    man.
          
                              SOLARA
                    More powerful than my dad?
          
                              ELI
                        (SMILES)
                    I should say so, yes.
          
          BEAT. The two of them sit in silence for a moment.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Would you teach me to read?
          
                              ELI
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never learned. No-one around here
                    knows how. Only my dad, and he
                    won't teach me. I think he likes
                    being the only one who can read. I
                    think it makes him feel powerful.
          
                              ELI
                    I think you're probably right.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    So would you teach me?
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
                    And I won't be back this way, ever.
          
          She looks down, sad. She likes this guy. She doesn't want him
          to leave. Eli can sense her sadness.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I guess a little.
          
                              ELI
                    There's some food on the table over
                    there. Let's eat.
          
          She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small
          cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a
          piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.
          
          The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's
          shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.
                        (to the rat)
                    Don't be afraid, pal. This is
                    Solara. She's our friend.
          
          Solara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The
          rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again.
          
                              ELI
                    It's okay. It means he likes you.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    It does?
                              ELI
                    Trust me, if he didn't like you,
                    you'd know about it.
          
          Solara pets the rat on her shoulder. Then:
          
                              SOLARA
                    Did you really mean that?
          
                                 ELI
                    Mean what?
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    That I'm your friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
          thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a
          friend? He can't even remember.
          
                              ELI
                    Sure.
          
          She smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear.
          
          Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's
          about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.
          
                              ELI
                    Our father, we thank you for this
                    meal which you have been so
                    gracious to place before us.
          
          Unsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hands
          together and bowing her head.
          
                               ELI
                    We thank you for a warm bed and a
                    roof over our heads on a cold night
                    such as this.
                        (BEAT)
                    And we thank you for the gift of
                    friendship in these hard times.
          
          Solara looks at him, touched by that.
          
                               ELI
                    Amen.
                        (BEAT)
                    You say that last part too.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Amen. And now we eat?
          
                              ELI
                    And now we eat.
          
          They sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal.
          
          PULL OUT from the window as they eat, away from the theater.
          Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight.
          Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is
          consumed by the darkness of the world.

          What was once the theater's COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS
          still stand around in the corners, creating an eerie feel.
          
          Carnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE, eating breakfast
          in silence. A third place is set, but no-one is seated there.
          
          Solara enters and sits down without a word.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Good morning, Solara.
          
          Solara doesn't say anything.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said good morning, Solara.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Morning, dad.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    How was your night? Did you sleep
                    well?
          
          Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing.
          Solara flashes him a frosty look.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I did like you asked. Isn't that
                    what you really want to know? Just
                    come out and say it.
          
          Carnegie glares at her sternly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You don't speak to your father like
                    that. When I ask you a civil
                    question, I expect a civil answer.
          
          Solara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did he say anything?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No. We didn't talk much.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Well, do you think you managed to
                    change his mind about staying?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know. He said he had to go.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          
          Carnegie puts down his food, looks angrily at her.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So he did talk? What else did he
                    say? Come on, I want all of it!
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's all he said. That he was
                    going to be leaving this morning.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    We'll see. This is my town, nobody
                    leaves until I say they leave.
          
          He glances knowingly at Claudia.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Solara, honey, eat something.
          
          She looks at the food on the plate before her. Then closes
          her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Our father, thank you for this meal
                    which you have been so gracious to
                    place before us.
          
          Claudia and Carnegie freeze. Carnegie stares at her, agape.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for my mother. Please
                    watch over her and keep her safe.
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you for all the-
          
                                CARNEGIE
                    Solara!
          She snaps suddenly out of it, looks at her father.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
          She doesn't respond. Looks embarrassed.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    God didn't put this food on the
                    table. Do you hear me?
                        (BEAT)
                    Who put this food on the table?
          
                                                                 58.
          
          
          Solara says nothing, just looks down at the table.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I said who put this food on the
                    table?
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    You did.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Who taught you that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli taught me.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                        (PUZZLED)
                    Who the hell is Eli?
          
                              SOLARA
                    The walker. That's his name.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    And he taught you how to say those
                    words? How did he know them?
          
                              SOLARA
                    He had them written down in a book.
          
          This piques Carnegie's interest greatly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What kind of a book?
          
          He barks the question at her. Solara is rattled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't remember! It was an old
                    leather book. It had kind of a...
                    thing on the front of it.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers.
          Carnegie's eyes widen; he can barely believe it.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He had a bible?
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's what it was. A holy bible.
                    Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Carnegie BOLTS SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE, overturning his chair
          and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - LOBBY BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD
          posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as
          Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Empty. No sign of Eli or his gear anywhere. The window is
          WIDE OPEN, the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze.
          
          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
          
          His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery
          from the generator and places it on the counter.
          
          Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
          TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery from
          him and stuffs it into his backpack.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the
          open window to Eli's room. He could have easily jumped.
          
          Redridge emerges onto the street behind him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Something wrong, boss?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Something wrong? Something wrong?
                    The walker's gone!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    That can't be. I had a man outside
                    his room the whole time.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    He jumped out the window, you
                    idiot! You didn't think to put a
                    man outside the fucking window?
                        (beat; fuming)
                    Find him. Now!
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss, he could be anywhere. He...
                        (REALIZATION)
                    A battery. Didn't he say something
                    about a battery?
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          They turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI
          EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.
          
          EVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's
          fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip.
          
          BEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second... and then
          ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
          
          Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just
          inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk.
          
          Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings
          Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.
          
          Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the
          theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Go! Go!
          
          They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit.
          
          Carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Solara and Claudia watch through the window. Turn suddenly
          when they hear the door slam open behind them.
          
          Carnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli
          darts along the boardwalk.
          
          CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the
          run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates,
          narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
          
          Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot
          HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
          
          Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more
          gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to
          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
          
          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
          
          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the
          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around
          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN
          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
          
                                                                 61.
          
          
          In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three
          shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke
          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
          
          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in
          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their
          heads remaining.
          
          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the
          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
          
          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
          
          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,
          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking
          angrily at her, shaking her.
          
          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to
          the road again.
          
                              ELI
                        (quietly; to himself)
                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path.
          
          But he sounds less resolute now than before. Until today this
          was always a simple decision for him to make. But now...
          
                                ELI
                    Dammit...
          
          He marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen
          bodies of the gunmen, re-loading his shotgun as he goes.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet,
          wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound.
          
          He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him.
          Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
          with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara
          against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun
          at Carnegie's head.
          
                              ELI
                    Let her go.
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    That cannon of yours casts a pretty
                    wide net. I don't reckon you can
                    hit me without hitting her.
          
                              ELI
                    I reckon you're right.
          
          He holsters the shotgun. Then in the same fluid motion draws
          a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had.
          
                              ELI
                    This, though? With this I'll shave
                    the hairs clean off your balls at a
                    hundred paces. You believe me?
          
          Carnegie releases his grip on Solara, steps away, hands up.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I believe you. I have to say I'm
                    surprised to hear that language
                    coming from you, though. I mean,
                    you being a holy man and all.
          
          BEAT. Eli glances at Solara.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    She told me all about it. Told me
                    all about the bible, too.
                        (BEAT)
                    Can I see it?
          
                              ELI
                    No.
          
          Carnegie takes a small step forward. Suddenly, his whole
          demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I've been searching for a
                    book like that one for years. All
                    I've ever wanted was to bring the
                    word of God to these poor
                    unfortunates here. To shine its
                    light upon them and give them
                    something in this wretched world
                    that they could believe in.
                    Something to live for! It's why I
                    built this town, did you know that?
                    All we've been missing is the word
                    to show us the way. And now, praise
                    the Lord, you've brought it to us.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          Carnegie takes a step closer. He appears entirely sincere -
          but then he is very good at doing so.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    It's not right to keep that book
                    hidden away, all to yourself. The
                    word is meant to be shared with
                    others. It's meant to be spread!
                    Isn't that what you want? I could
                    help you do that. You and me, we
                    could do it together.
          
          BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    The Lord himself told me that if I
                    carried this book west, one day I
                    would find the place where it was
                    needed. Where it would be safe.
                    Where it belonged.
          
          Carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of
          movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor.
          
                              ELI
                    But this ain't it.
          
          He turns to Solara and offers her his hand.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli emerges from the theater, leading Solara onto the street.
          RESIDENTS part before them, staring at Eli with astonishment.
          
          Eli passes the statue of Carnegie - and STOPS. Something
          about that thing is bothering him.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What? What is it?
          
                              ELI
                    You shall not make for yourself any
                    graven image...
          
          He turns, drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid
          motion SLICING across the base of the statue.
          
          BEAT. And then the STATUE TOPPLES from the neat cut just
          below the knees, CRASHING DOWN to the ground and SHATTERING.
          The assembled residents GASP at this defiant display.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again.
          
                              ELI
                    Now we can go.
          
          CRANE UP over the main street as they both head out of town.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli and
          Solara. Eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and slow.
          Still, Solara lags along behind. She's already tired.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where are we going?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you where I'm going. You're
                    free to go wherever you want.
          
          She stops in the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Wait... I'm not coming with you?
          
                              ELI
                    You're only going to slow me down.
          
          Eli doesn't stop walking. Solara is forced to catch up.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So what the hell was all that about
                    back there?
          
                              ELI
                    The man was hurting you. I don't
                    like that, so I put a stop to it.
                    Now you're free. He can't hurt you
                    any more.
                        (off her stare)
                    No need to thank me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Thank you? For what? What am I
                    supposed to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Whatever you want. That's what
                    being free is.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Whatever I want. Except go with
                    you.
          
                                                                   65.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I have to get where I'm going. I
                    can't be worrying about someone
                    else along the way.
          
          Solara is incredibly hurt by this. Blinks back a tear.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I thought you were my friend.
          
          BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her.
          
                              ELI
                    It's dangerous in the outland. I
                    wouldn't want you to get hurt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'll be safe so long as I'm with
                    you. I know it.
          
          Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the
          harsh truth of it:
          
                              ELI
                    You don't want this life. I gotta
                    do what I gotta do. Don't have no
                    choice in it. But you do. And I
                    can't let you choose this. You
                    don't want to be like me. You don't
                    want to spend your life alone.
          
          Solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If I came with you, I wouldn't be
                    alone. And neither would you.
          
          A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as
          though Solara might have won him over. But then:
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best
                    you just go on back to town.
          
          He turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands
          there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Fine! I'll do just that! I had a
                    life there! A family! I didn't ask
                    you to save me! I didn't ask you
                    for anything!
          
                                                                 66.
          
          
          He doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking
          off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time.
          
          Solara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone.
          
                              SOLARA
                        (SOFTLY)
                    Fine.
          
          She turns and walks back in the direction she came.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY
          
          A small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium
          containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats,
          sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens.
          
          Carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed
          from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with
          satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed.
          
          Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Thank you, darling.
          
          Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's
          pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch. They
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never
                    even heard of anything like that.
          
          Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You know, I always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd. Bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost.
                    Tending to my flock. But all the
                    things I want to do, I can't do
                    them on my own. The one thing I've
                    needed is the one thing that's
                    always been missing. Then one day
                    it walks right into town - so close
                    I can almost touch it - and then
                    walks right on out again.
          
          Carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge.
          
                                                                 67.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I want you to put a crew together
                    and go out after him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's not going to work for you. I
                    think he's made that plain.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I'm not interested in him any more.
                    I only want the book he's carrying.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting
                    down this maniac in the outland, I
                    need to know it's gonna be worth
                    it. I need to know what's so
                    special about this goddamn book.
          
          BEAT as Carnegie considers this.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You have no idea. You're too young,
                    you don't remember the world
                    before. But I do. I remember.
          
          He turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    When I was a kid my parents used to
                    read that book every goddamn day.
                    My mother, she'd read it along with
                    this smooth-talking preacher on the
                    TV screen. They used to be able to
                    beam these guys right into your
                    house, into every house in the
                    world, through the air. Like magic.
                        (BEAT)
                    She worked two jobs and she sent
                    every spare penny she had to that
                    fucking guy on the TV. My old man,
                    he'd read that book, then he'd get
                    liquored up and kick my ass, tell
                    me all about the power and the
                    glory and how I was going to burn
                    forever in hell for the sins I was
                    born with. He made sure he beat it
                    into me good.
          
          He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Don't you see? It's not just any
                    book.

                    It has the power to motivate
                    people. It can give them hope, it
                    can terrify them. It can shape
                    them. Control them.

                    Do you remember how I built this
                    town? It wasn't done with force,
                    and it wasn't done just with water.
                    It was done with the power of
                    words. I created this place out of
                    nothing, because people believed in
                    a promise that I sold to them.
                    Those guys on the TV, they were
                    richer than you could ever dream,
                    and it was all built the same way.
                    With words. With promises. And with
                    that book.
                        (BEAT)
                    That book is a weapon. Aimed right
                    at the hearts and minds of the weak
                    and the desperate. Just imagine
                    what I could do with it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Boss... we're running out of water
                    and the people are running out of
                    patience. You're trying to tell me
                    that a book is going to keep them
                    in line?
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll do much more than that.
                    The water in this town may run dry,
                    but faith - that springs eternal!
                    And that faith will help turn this
                    town into a city. And this city
                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.
                    People will come from far and wide
                    to hear what's inside of it.
                    They'll follow me anywhere just to
                    get a taste of it. And they'll do
                    whatever I tell them.
          
          As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has
          totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    And what if this book don't work?
                    What if it don't say what you want
                    it to say?
          
                                                                 69.
          
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Oh, it'll say what I want, I can
                    promise you that. Because I'm going
                    to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts
                    that work for me and make the rest
                    whatever I need it to be.
                        (BEAT)
                    A new bible, for a new world.
          
          He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What do you think, darling? A whole
                    new world, to do with as we will.
                    Won't that be grand?
          
          She smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified.
          
          Carnegie turns back to Redridge.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Find that book.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He has half a day on us already.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    So use the motor pool.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    There ain't much gas in reserve.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Whatever there is, use it.
          
          Redridge nods and goes to leave.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What about Solara?
          
          BEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been
          completely forgotten about.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    She's still out there. With him.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Right. Right. Of course. Bring her
                    back, too, if you can. But-
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The book. I know.
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          Redridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he
          doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.
          
          EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY
          
          Solara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down
          mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.
          
          She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction,
          unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.
          
          There are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is
          which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Shit. Shit.
          
          She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny-
          miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed
          firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.
          
          Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of
          the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking.
          
          He stands there for a long time.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't
          remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where the hell am I?
          
          There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every
          other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.
          
          She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE
          BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.
          
          Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.
          
          In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER.
          Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.
          
          She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle,
          but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She
          pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
          
          Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
          
          She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
          
          She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
          
          She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.
          
          INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
          shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
          
          She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
          
          She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
          beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello?
          
          Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.
          
                              FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello? Can anyone help me?
          
          EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          She runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.
          
          A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.
          
                              SLUMPED FEMALE
                    Hello? Is anybody there?
          
          Solara starts walking toward her.
          
          The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
          
          As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          We see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before.
          The same shopping cart. The same trap.
          
                                SOLARA
                      Are you all right?
          
          The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's
          shocked to see that it's a girl.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You
                      go along, I'll be okay.
          
                                SOLARA
                      You look like you need some help.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      No, really! I'm fine. Really... I
                      need a man to help. Not you. You
                      just keep along. Please.
          
          The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.
          
                                SOLARA
                      It'll just take a minute.
          
          She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Really, it's fine! Please!
          
          Too   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every
          bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on
          the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from
          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
          
          The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                      I ain't too sure about that.
          
          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.
          
                                YOUNG WOMAN
                      This wasn't the deal!
          
          The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
                    be grateful you're getting a break.
          
          He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Never did care much for that dried-
                    up old snatch anyhow.
          
          He looks back to the struggling Solara.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    This one, though... this one looks
                    fresh. You a virgin?
          
          She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.
          
                              BRIGAND LEADER
                    Well, let's find out.
          
          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
          
          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
          
          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
          
          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
          
          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
          
          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
          
          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
          
          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.
          
          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
          
          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
          
          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS
          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
          
          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
          
          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
          
          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.
          
          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
          
          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
          
          He crouches down between them in the dust.
          
                              ELI
                    I offer you both one final chance
                    in this life to seek forgiveness
                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation. Will you say
                    with me the act of contrition?
          
          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.
          
                                BRIGAND LEADER
                    Fuck you.
          
          Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
          
                              ELI
                    Some might think it'd be most
                    fitting to leave you here like
                    this. Let you die slow in the sun.
                    But I know better. I know where
                    you're going. And the sooner you
                    get there, the sooner you'll get
                    what's coming to you.
          
          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
          
          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.
          
                                RIFLE BANDIT
                    Wait!
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    I want to say it. I want to be
                    forgiven.
          
          Eli crouches once more by his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Repeat after me. Oh God, I am
                    heartily sorry for having offended
                    thee, and I detest all my sins.
          
          The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words
          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.
          
                              ELI
                    I firmly resolve, with the help of
                    thy grace, to confess my sins, and
                    do penance, and to amend my life.
                    Amen.
          
                              RIFLE BANDIT
                    Amen...
          
          His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli
          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.
          
          Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You came back for me.
          
                              ELI
                    What are friends for?
          
          She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.
          
          He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.
          
                              ELI
                    This is the deal. You keep up. You
                    pull your weight. You fall behind,
                    I can't help you. Okay?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay.
          
          She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What about her?
          
                                                                    76.
          
          
                              ELI
                    There's nothing can be done for
                    her.
          
          They walk on down the road.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.
          
          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
          
          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.
          
          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.
          
          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.
          
          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you
          could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each
          adorned with plate armor and weapons.
          
          In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to
          the DRIVER, who guns the engine.
          
          The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great
          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.
          
          EXT. DESERT - DAY
          
          Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far
          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.
          
          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
          
          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,
          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
          
          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You killed it! That cute little
                    thing!
          
          Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.
          
                                                                    77.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's good eating, is what it is.
          
          He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.
          
          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the
          dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and
          staggers backward, falling on her butt.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That's not funny.
          
                              ELI
                    If you're going to be on the road,
                    you can't be picky about what you
                    eat. You eat what's there to eat.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I'm not eating that.
          
                              ELI
                        (SHRUGS)
                    More for me.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK
          
          Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a
          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
          
          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down
          penitently at the ground.
          
                              ELI
                    Father, we thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us with
                    this meal. Bless this food to our
                    use and us to thy service, and keep
                    us ever mindful of the needs of
                    others. Amen.
          
          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.
          
          Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What does that taste like?
          
          He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.
          
                              ELI
                    Tastes like chicken.
          
                                                                 78.
          
          
          She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't.
          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a
          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.
          
          As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is that?
          
          Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.
          
                              ELI
                    It's a Saint Christopher medal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a
                    character from your book?
          
          Eli smiles and shakes his head.
          
                              ELI
                    Christopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.
          
          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
          
                              ELI
                    Then one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What is a saint, anyway?
          
                                                                 79.
          
          
                              ELI
                    It's someone who spent their life
                    doing good things for others.
                    Enough that God himself took a
                    special interest in them.
          
          Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Someone like you.
          
          Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.
          
                              ELI
                    No. Not like me. Saints ain't
                    killers. And I done too much of
                    that. Spilled too much blood.
          
          BEAT. No words, just the flickering firelight.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Will you read me some more from the
                    book?
          
                              ELI
                    It's late. You should get some
                    sleep. Maybe tomorrow.
          
          LATER - NIGHT
          
          The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
          
          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Eli?
          
          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
          
          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
          
          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:
          
                               WELCOME TO WAL-MART
                                 MY NAME IS "ELI"
                               HOW MAY I HELP YOU?
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of
          it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.
          
          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.
          
          There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.
          
          Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.
          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.
          
                              ELI
                    What are you doing?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You scared me! I thought you were
                    asleep.
          
                              ELI
                    On the road you sleep with one eye
                    open. I asked you what you were
                    doing.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I just wanted to see the book.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to see the book, you ask
                    me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.
                    Until it gets where it's going. Do
                    you understand?
          
          He's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him.
          
                              ELI
                    Tell me you understand!
          
          He grips her wrist tighter.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Okay! I understand! Ow!
          
          Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it
          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.
          
                              ELI
                    It's no use to you anyway. You
                    don't know how to read it.
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well... now we have the time, maybe
                    you can teach me.
          
                              ELI
                    Maybe. Get some sleep.
          
          She lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes.
          She just lies there, watching him.
          
          EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the
          FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.
          
          The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge
          gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.
          
          The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew
          them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's been here.
          
          Redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
          bodies and back onto the road. Two sets of tracks.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    The girl's with him.
          
          He moves back to the cars.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                    Move out!
          
          The other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half-
          eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I said move out!
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN
                    I heard this guy's protected
                    somehow, some... power from up
                    above. That there ain't nothing on
                    this earth can touch him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's just a man. You put a bullet
                    in him, he'll go down like any
                    other. I don't want to hear no more
                    of this superstitious horseshit!
          
                                                                 82.
          
          
          Hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The
          cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the
          abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out
          buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town.
          
          Solara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her
          surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You say you've been walking for
                    twenty-five years. Have you ever
                    considered that you might be lost?
          
                                 ELI
                    No.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But how can you know? How can you
                    know this is the right way?
          
                              ELI
                    I told you. My path has been laid
                    out before me.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Yeah, but laid out by who?
          
                              ELI
                    By Almighty God.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Well if this God guy's so mighty,
                    how come it's taking you so long to
                    get where you're going? Doesn't he
                    know the way?
          
          Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.
          
                              ELI
                    You want to stay on this road with
                    me, don't ever let me hear you take
                    his name in vain like that again.
          
          Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Sorry.
          
          Eli resumes walking.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
                              ELI
                    God has a reason for everything
                    being the way it is. It's not
                    always apparent to us. But it is
                    his plan nonetheless.
          
                              SOLARA
                    So, is he talking to you right now?
                    Telling you where to go?
          
                              ELI
                    It's not like that. It's kinda hard
                    to explain. I'm guided by faith.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't know what that word means.
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it.
          
                              ELI
                    It means you know something even
                    though you don't know it.
          
          Solara thinks about this, shakes her head.
          
                              SOLARA
                    That doesn't make any sense at all.
          
                              ELI
                    It doesn't have to.
          
          They walk on.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.
          
          Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact.
          
          The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
          
          Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I don't get it. It looks almost...
                    normal. Like nothing ever happened.
                    How can it still be out here?
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Maybe we should look inside. There
                    might be food.
          
          BEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun.
          
                              ELI
                    Stay behind me.
          
          They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
          
          Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
          
          They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This is weird.
          
                              ELI
                    Yeah.
          
          Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.
          
                              ELI
                    Shit.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What?
          
          A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.
          
          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
          
          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
          
          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
          
          Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.
          
                                                                 85.
          
          
          They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Who are you?
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Eli. This is Solara.
                    We're travelers, that's all. We
                    don't mean you any harm.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    You cut my padlock. I saw you.
                    Trying to break into our house.
          
                              ELI
                    I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody
                    lived here. We thought it was
                    abandoned, like all the rest.
          
          This seems to annoy the man.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Take a look around you. Look at
                    this yard. Does it look abandoned
                    to you?
          
          Clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful
          means at his disposal.
          
                              ELI
                    No, sir. I... like what you've done
                    with the place.
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    What's your business here?
          
                              ELI
                    No business. We're sorry to have
                    troubled you. If you'll let us down
                    we'll happily be on our way.
          
          The wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    George, look at them! They're not
                    robbers or road agents! One of
                    them's just a girl!
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Seen that before. Oldest trick in
                    the book.
          
                                                                   86.
          
          
                              ELDERLY WOMAN
                    Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them
                    down!
          
          The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.
          
          The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the
          noose from their ankles.
          
                                ELDERLY WOMAN
                    I'm so sorry about my husband. We
                    so rarely get visitors these days,
                    he's suspicious of everybody.
                         (BEAT)
                    I'm Martha and this is my husband
                    George. Would you care for some
                    tea?
          
          Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this?
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          It's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.
          
          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
          
          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.
          
                              MARTHA
                    I'm afraid we don't have any cake
                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.
          
          She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Please.
          
          They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.
          
                                                                 87.
          
          
                              MARTHA
                    How do you like it?
          
                              ELI
                    It's.. uh...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's very good.
          
          Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips.
          HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer.
          
                              ELI
                    Have you always lived here?
          
                              MARTHA
                    For almost forty years now. This
                    home is our pride and joy, isn't
                    it, George?
          
          George just grunts. Not interested in conversation.
          
                              MARTHA
                    We refused to leave, even during
                    the troubles. We said, didn't we
                    George, we said if we're going to
                    die anywhere, we're going to die
                    right here, in our own home.
          
                              ELI
                    I don't understand how you've
                    survived out here this long.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Well, George is something of a
                    handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
                    a lot of work on the place, making
                    it safe. We may be old, but we're
                    resilient. We've had more than a
                    few who've tried to take this place
                    from us. Haven't we, George?
          
                              GEORGE
                    Yes. Yes we have.
          
          He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and
          beckons Eli and Solara to come look.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard.
          Solara is horrified by what she sees.
          
                                                                 88.
          
          
          The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD. Maybe twenty human
          graves dug shallow into the earth. Some were dug long ago,
          others look like they're very recent.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Are these... graves?
          
                              MARTHA
                    Of course. It would be uncivilized
                    not to bury them. We're not
                    barbarians.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Plus, it's good for the soil.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Come on back inside. I think I
                    might be able to rustle up some
                    sandwiches.
          
          George and Martha go back inside, leaving Eli and Solara
          gazing at the little graveyard.
          
                              ELI
                    We have to get out of here.
          
                              SOLARA
                    They look so sweet... I would never
                    have believed they were killers.
          
                              ELI
                    They're worse than that.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                               ELI
                    They didn't just kill these people.
                        (BEAT)
                    They ate them.
          
          Solara is stunned.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    They what?
                              ELI
                    There's a disease in the outland.
                    Spread by eating human meat. It
                    affects the brain. Dementia, loss
                    of motor function. Did you notice
                    the old woman's hands shaking?
                    She's got it. They've both got it.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh my God...
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously.
          He's still carrying that shotgun.
          
          Martha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN.
          
                              MARTHA (O.S.)
                    I found some meat for those
                    sandwiches! Are you hungry?
          
                              SOLARA
                    No! Thank you!
          
                              ELI
                    We really must be going.
          
                               GEORGE
                    So soon?
          
          An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.
          
                              ELI
                    Yes, I'm afraid so.
          
          As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to
          tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for
          him. A tense BEAT.
          
          Martha emerges from the kitchen.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Are you sure you won't stay?
          
                              ELI
                    Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
          
          Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli
          opens the door and escorts Solara outside.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden
          path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS.
          
          THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the
          horizon in a hazy cloud of dust.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.
          
                                                                 90.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Are you sure?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I recognize the cars.
          
                              ELI
                    Back inside.
          
          Eli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the
          doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          George follows them back in, furious.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What did you bring upon us?
          
                              MARTHA
                    George? What's wrong?
          
                              GEORGE
                    A whole convoy of armed
                    degenerates, that's what's wrong!
                    Coming here for them! And they led
                    them right to us!
          
          Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain.
          Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.
          
          The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
          them, locking and loading weapons.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Oh no they don't...
          
          She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha, what are you doing?
          
                              MARTHA
                    I finally got this house just the
                    way I want it. I'm not going to let
                    anybody tear it apart!
          
          She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
          Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
          
          A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
          Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.
          
                                                                 91.
          
          
          She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her
          shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a
          post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Where did you get all this stuff?
          
          George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Took `em off them who came looking
                    to take the place from us. Built up
                    quite the stash over the years.
          
          He offers a .44 MAGNUM to Solara.
          
                              GEORGE
                    You know how to fire a gun?
          
                              SOLARA
                    My daddy showed me once.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Just like riding a bike.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I never rode a bike.
          
          George sighs, turns instead to Eli.
          
                              GEORGE
                    How about you, you know how to-
          
          Eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel.
          Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Never mind.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge steps forward, raises a BULLHORN.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We know you're in there! Come on
                    out with your hands up and your
                    weapons on the deck and nobody
                    needs to get hurt.
          
          SILENCE. No sign of activity inside the house.
          
          Redridge turns back to his men. Their hands trembling. They
          didn't sign up for this, and they're not ready for it.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          Redridge turns back to the house. Into the bullhorn:
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    All right, look. I'm gonna make it
                    easy on y'all. Bring out the girl
                    with the book.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli is crouched beneath the window. George and Martha have
          taken up positions at other windows, peering out.
          
                              REDRIDGE (O.S.)
                    That's all we want. The girl and
                    the book. The rest of you's can go
                    your way.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are we going to do?
          
          BEAT as Eli thinks.
          
                              ELI
                    Hand me my pack.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Redridge waits. Still no sign of a response. His nervous
          gunmen exchange worried looks.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #2
                    They ain't comin' out. They-
          
          Redridge raises his hand to silence him. Looks up as an
          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
          
          A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
          
          Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
          
          He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.
          
                                THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY
          
          It's a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE. The small red light on top of
          the unit ILLUMINATES WITH A BEEP. Armed.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Holy shi...
          
                                                                    93.
          
          
          He drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back
          toward the vehicles.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Get down! Everybody get down!
          
          He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE
          MINE EXPLODES, SHATTERING EVERY WINDOW OF EVERY VEHICLE. The
          lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES,
          cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
          
          Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming
          wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.
          
          MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the
          vehicles' armor. The gunmen cower behind cover.
          
                                REDRIDGE
                      Damn you, return fire!
          
          Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE. Inspired by his
          example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
          BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.

          Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60. Screaming at
          the top of her lungs, loving every minute of it.
          
                                MARTHA
                      Come and get it, you god-damn sons
                      of mother-fucking bitches!
          
          George and Eli also open fire from their windows,
          periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire.
          
          Solara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing.
          
                                ELI
                      It's all right. We're going to be
                      all right. Trust me.
          
          MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head.
          
                                ELI
                      You remember what I told you about
                      faith?
          
          She nods.
          
          Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the
          enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return
          fire impacts around him.
          
                                                                 94.
          
          
                              ELI
                    We're going to get out of this
                    alive. Both of us. I know.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Because God told you?
          
                              ELI
                    Because God told me.
          
          Amidst all the chaos and gunfire, George has been listening
          to this exchange.
          
                              GEORGE
                    What about us?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    He didn't mention you.
          
          BEAT. George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. Six of them dead
          now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from
          inside the house. They're losing.
          
          Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the
          trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.
          
          He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing
          through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE
          HOUSE in a fiery explosion.
          
          INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.
          
          Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his
          arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.
          
                              GEORGE
                    Martha? Martha!
          
          He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
          kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.
          
          George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.
          
                                                                    95.
          
          
          Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
          
          George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Redridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover.
          George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    We got any more of those RPGs?
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3
                    That was it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Screw this.
          
          Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns
          the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the
          butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE.
          
                                 REDRIDGE
                    Get clear!
          
          The gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE
          HOUSE, engine roaring. CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE.
          
          INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM.
          He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE
          LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to
          a stop.
          
          More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
          winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
          WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
          and moves through the smoke.
          
                                 ELI
                    Solara?
          
                                 SOLARA (O.S.)
                    Eli!
          
          He finds her in the smoke. She embraces him.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you all right?
          
                                                                 96.
          
          
                                SOLARA
                    I'm fine.
          
          As the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE
          WALL BY THE MINIVAN. His body crushed. Dead.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Oh God...
          
                              ELI
                    Come on. We're going out the back.
                    We're running.
          
          As he helps her to her feet, we hear the sound of MOVEMENT
          THROUGH THE RUBBLE.
          
          They turn around. The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE, passing
          through the smoking hole left by the minivan.
          
          Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
          COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Go ahead and try it, holy man. You
                    ain't that fast.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and
          marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles.
          
          Eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. Redridge
          faces him and points a pistol at his head.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Where's the book?
          
          BEAT. Eli doesn't answer. Redridge cocks the pistol.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    I ain't playing.
          
          Redridge stares him down. Eli just stares right back. Totally
          unflappable. Redridge motions to his men.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Check the pack.
          
          The gunman carrying Eli's pack opens it up and tips its
          contents out onto the ground. The ghillie suit, battery, some
          old canned goods, other odds and ends. No sign of the book.
          
                              CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4
                    It ain't here.
          
                                                                 97.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    It's gotta be.
          
          Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli, going through his
          pockets. Finds nothing. He opens Eli's coat and checks the
          inside pockets. Digs around deep inside.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Hello, what have we here?
          
          And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN. Yanks his hand out to
          reveal ELI'S RAT, TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH.
          
          Redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off
          him, but it won't let go. His hand is bleeding badly.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
          
          He finally manages to shake it free. It hits the floor dazed.
          Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot, reducing it to a bloody
          smear in the dirt. Eli lowers his head in sadness.
          
          Redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at Eli furiously.
          Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the
          muzzle tight against his forehead.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    If you don't got the book, what
                    fucking use are you?
          
          His finger tightens on the trigger.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Wait!
          
          She breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward
          Redridge. Reaches inside her dress and PRODUCES THE BIBLE.
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's here! I've got it! Please
                    don't kill him.
          
                                ELI
                    Solara...
          
                              SOLARA
                    It's just a book, Eli. No book is
                    worth giving up your life for.
          
                              ELI
                    You're wrong.
          
                                                                   98.
          
          
          Satisfied, Redridge takes the book. Runs his hand over the
          leather cover, gazes admiringly at the gold-embossed cross.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    You did good, sweetheart. Your
                    daddy would be proud. He knew you'd
                    come through for him.
          
          Solara looks at Eli guiltily. She feels terrible.
          
                              SOLARA
                    He said he would hurt my mom. If I
                    didn't help him.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                        (SMILING)
                    Daddy's little girl...
          
          Solara stands between him and Eli. Deadly serious now.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I want you to let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What?
          
                              SOLARA
                    You've got what you came for. You
                    don't need him. Let him go.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    He's killed a dozen of my men.
          
                              SOLARA
                    If you hurt him, I'm not coming
                    back with you. You'll have to drag
                    me kicking and screaming.
          
          Solara glares at Redridge. He sighs. He can tell she means
          it. It's not worth the aggravation. He turns back to Eli.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Take your shit and get out of here.
          
          Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes
          to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    No weapons.
          
          Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and
          walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara:
          
                                                                   99.
          
          
                              ELI
                    I told you we'd both live. Now do
                    you have faith?
          
          A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.
          
          Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
          vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.
          
          IN THE REARMOST VEHICLE
          
          Solara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as
          it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy.
          
          She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.
          
          She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.
          
          LATER
          
          Solara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her
          cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.
          
          And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at
          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come
          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.
          
          REDRIDGE'S VEHICLE
          
          The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.
          
                              DRIVER
                    What the hell...?
          
          Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then
          SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Stop, stop!
          
          The car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the
          rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is
          KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT.
          
          The door closes again, the engine revs and the car TURNS
          AROUND, racing back down the road in the direction it came.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    Shit. Turn around!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We ain't got the gas for it!
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    She's getting away!
          
                              DRIVER
                    We got the book! And we got barely
                    enough gas to make it back as it
                    is! We can't go chasin' her!
          
          BEAT. Redridge knows he's right.
          
                               REDRIDGE
                    Stupid little bitch...
                        (BEAT)
                    Drive on.
          
          The car moves on, following the rest of the convoy.
          
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
          
          Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
          wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to
          where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up.
          
          EXT. ROAD - DUSK
          
          Solara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Come on, come on...
          
          Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon.
          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.
          
          Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the
          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.
          
                                SOLARA
                    No... No!
          
          The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.
          
          ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.
          
          Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.
          
                                SOLARA
                    Eli! Eli!
          
          He doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking.
          
          She finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Eli...
          
                              ELI
                    Thought you'd gone back to town.
          
                              SOLARA
                    I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so
                    sorry.
          
                                 ELI
                    For what?
          
                              SOLARA
                    For what? I betrayed you! I gave
                    them the book!
          
                              ELI
                    You did what you believed you had
                    to.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You're not mad at me?
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ELI
                    I forgive you.
          
          She continues walking alongside him. Trying to process this.
          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.
          
          She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of
          atonement.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Here. I thought you might still
                    need this.
          
          Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to
          him. He takes it and slings it over his shoulder.
          
                                 ELI
                    Thank you.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What are you going to do now?
          
                              ELI
                    Same as always. Keep heading west.
          
                              SOLARA
                    Why? I mean, you don't have the
                    book any more.
          
                                                                  102.
          
          
                              ELI
                    But I still have my faith.
          
          They walk on together, into the sunset.
          
          EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and
          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.
          
          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of
          grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's that?
          
          Eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass.
          
                              ELI
                    It's grass. It used to grow all
                    over the place.
          
                              SOLARA
                    How come it's here?
          
                              ELI
                    I don't know. Less poison in the
                    air this near to the ocean, maybe.
          
          They keep walking. Eli groans, clutches his side. Does his
          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.
          
                              SOLARA
                    What's wrong?
          
                              ELI
                    Nothing. Just a cramp.
          
          EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
          
          They walk on through the night. Eli stops and sniffs the air.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    What?
          
                              ELI
                    Do you smell that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    Smell what?
          
                              ELI
                    Salt in the air. We're close to the
                    ocean. We're almost there.
          
                                                                103.
          
          
          EXT. CALIFORNIA ROAD - DAWN
          
          They keep on along the road. A shallow uphill incline. They
          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.
          
          THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
          
          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
          
          Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed,
          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.
          
                               ELI
                    Come on.
          
          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way south across the bridge, side-
          stepping the fractures in the road.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO RUINS - DAY
          
          Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
          Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's
          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
          
          They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.
          
          Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.
          
                              ELI
                    Watch your footing. Step where I
                    step.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
          
          More buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing
          more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the
          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.
          
          The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.
          
                              SOLARA
                    This... this is the world before?
          
                                                                104.
          
          
                              ELI
                    What's left of it.
          
          They keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAY
          
          Once a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing
          the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The
          celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped
          at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.
          
          Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His
          breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.
          
          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY
          
          A dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound
          of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all.
          
          Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end.
          The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a
          RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's
          sheared-off edge.
          
          Eli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you see that?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I see it. Is that it?
          
                                 ELI
                    That's it.
          
          Reveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to:
          
          ALCATRAZ ISLAND
          
          Looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated.
          The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It
          feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli
          has sought for so many years.
          
          A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          EXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It
          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY
          
          Eli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked.
          As they inspect it for a possible way to enter:
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Who goes there?
          
          They look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
          in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Identify yourselves!
          
          In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on
          them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands.
          
                              ELI
                    My name is Elijah Stone. I have a
                    message for your boss. I need you
                    to tell him that I have a King
                    James Bible in my possession.
          
          BEAT.
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Remain where you are! Do not
                    attempt to move or you will be
                    fired upon!
          
          Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear
          the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.
          
          The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:
          
                              ALCATRAZ GUARD
                    Be prepared to surrender any
                    weapons at the gate!
          
          BEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON
          MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron.
          
          Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.
          
                                                                106.
          
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS
          
          As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
          HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi-
          official militia. But every bit as deadly.
          
          Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take
          Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.
          
                              SOLDIER
                    They're clean.
          
          The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN
          wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed
          jacket and tie. Professorial, academic.
          
          He approaches, shakes Eli's hand vigorously - very excited.
          
                              THIN MAN
                    Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor
                    Lombardi. I'm the curator here.
          
                              ELI
                    Elijah Stone.
          
                                 SOLARA
                    Solara.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Solara. What a delightful name. Is
                    that by any chance Shakespearean?
          
                              SOLARA
                    I, uh, I think it's Japanese.
          
                                 LOMBARDI
                    Wonderful.
          
          He turns back to Eli.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Is it true what they tell me? You
                    have a King James Version?
          
                              ELI
                    Been carrying it with me for twenty-
                    five years.
          
          Solara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to
          contain his excitement.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    My goodness. I can't tell you how
                    exciting this is. Well, come, come!

                              LOMBARDI (cont'd)
                    I'll give you the nickel tour and
                    then we can all sit down and take a
                    look at it.
          
          He leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings.
          
          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Redridge's remaining vehicles drive back into town and come
          to a halt outside the theater. Redridge emerges from his car,
          carrying the bible. Walks up to the Palladium and enters.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAY
          
          What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked
          floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
          around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Yes, we've been doing this for some
                    time now. Collected over thirty
                    thousand volumes from generous
                    donors all across the nation. We
                    even have a printing press that we
                    hope to have operational soon.
          
          Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books.
          She's never seen anything like it.
          
                              SOLARA
                    You turned the whole prison into a
                    library?
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Well, not exactly. We're more like
                    a storage facility. We're holding
                    these books here in trust, if you
                    like. When society gets back on its
                    feet and no longer needs us to
                    preserve these volumes, they'll be
                    here waiting.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must ask you, how did you hear
                    about us? We've been doing
                    everything we can to get the word
                    out, but we always like to know
                    where our benefactors come from.
          
                              ELI
                    I was sent here by God.
          
          Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
                               LOMBARDI
                    Is that right? Well, it's good to
                    know we're getting such high-
                    profile referrals these days.
                        (BEAT)
                    I must say, I am so excited that we
                    finally have a King James. You
                    know, we have a Talmud here, we
                    have two Korans, we even have that
                    Scientology book. But never a
                    Christian bible, until now. I
                    honestly believed it was the one
                    book I'd never see again, after
                    what happened...
          
          BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    May I ask what condition it's in?
          
                              ELI
                    It's a little beat-up. But it'll do
                    the job.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Well, then. What say we take a look
                    at it?
          
          Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara,
          interested to know where this is going to go next.
          
          Eli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side.
          
                              ELI
                    Is there someplace we could sit?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Of course. Right this way.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Redridge appears. Carnegie looks at him eagerly.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Did you get it?
          
          Redridge holds the bible up proudly. Carnegie beams.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    Show me.
          
          Redridge hands it over. Carnegie sits back in his chair,
          running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    The new world begins here...
          
          He opens the book and looks inside.
          
          BEAT. And then he looks up at Redridge, confused.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    What the fuck is this?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Eli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room
          tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby.
          
                              ELI
                    Do you have something you can write
                    with?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
          
          He pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Could you please bring us some
                    writing paper?
          
          The guard nods and moves toward the door. As he does so:
          
                              ELI
                    Bring a lot of it.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his
          complexion ashen. Like he's just been slapped in the face.
          
                              REDRIDGE
                    What? What is it?
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the
          cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi.
          
                              ELI
                    Are you ready?
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    What exactly am I writing?
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
                              ELI
                    Pay close attention and write down
                    every word exactly as I say it.
          
          Eli removes his goggles. Solara can't believe what she sees.
          
          His eyes are pale, milky-white, dead. TOTALLY BLIND.
          
                              ELI
                    The First Book of Moses called
                    Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In
                    the beginning God created the
                    heavens and the earth. Verse two.
                    The earth was without form, and
                    void; and darkness was on the face
                    of the deep. And the spirit of God
                    was hovering over the face of the
                    waters. Verse three. And God said,
                    "Let there be light," and there was
                    light.
          
          Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
          
          Carnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits
          open on the desk before him.
          
          A BRAILLE BIBLE.
          
          Claudia is ushered in by a guard.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    What's wrong?
          
          He rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You told me once that you know how
                    to read this. This blind language.
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Well, a long time ago, when I was a
                    little girl...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    You're going to read it for me.
                    Every word. And I'm going to write
                    it down. Start at the beginning.
          
          As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia
          opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
          lettering.
          
                                                                111.
          
          
          For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint
          smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,
          eagerly clutching the writing materials.
          
                               CLAUDIA
                    I'm sorry. It's been so long. I
                    don't remember. I don't remember
                    any of it.
          
          Carnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him,
          threatening to explode...
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    God fucking dammit!
          
          He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
          Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
          but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
          out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
          auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats.
          
          As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
          
                              CLAUDIA
                    Bill, is there something-
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    Just go. Just get out of my sight.
          
          He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly
          turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
          
          INT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT
          
          Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been
          filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
          
          Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up
          with Eli's recitation.
          
          Solara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat
          covering her to keep her warm.
          
          Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite.
          He looks paler now than ever. Close to death.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
                    the strength and the conviction to
                    complete the task you entrusted to
                    me. Thank you for guiding me
                    straight and true, through the many
                    obstacles in my path.

                    And for keeping me resolute when
                    all around seemed lost.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - PRE-DAWN
          
          The prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn.
          
          Solara crosses the yard. She looks more mature somehow.
          Determined and strong. She carries with her ELI'S SWORD - and
          something else, tucked under her arm.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for your protection and
                    for your many signs along the way.
          
          She stops in a nondescript corner of the yard.
          
          At her feet is a SHALLOW MOUND OF DIRT. At the head of the
          mound, a SIMPLE TOMBSTONE.
          
          She kneels and places a SINGLE FLOWER on the grave.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Lit only by the pale moonlight, barely enough to see by.
          
          Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia,
          wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, careful
          not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.
          
          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          
          Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, searching
          blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats.
          
          She finds Eli's bible in some litter strewn on the floor.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the good that I have
                    done. For whatever light you were
                    able to shine into the darkness of
                    this world through me.
          
          Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs her
          fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can barely
          see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The joy.
          
          EXT. ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - DAWN
          
          As Solara kneels by the grave, we see now that she wears
          Eli's SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT around her neck.
          
          The tombstone reads:
          
                                                                113.
          
          
                               HERE LIES ELIJAH STONE
                                DIED AUGUST 21, 2048
                            FAITHFUL SERVANT TO THE LORD
                                AND FRIEND TO SOLARA
          
          She unsheathes Eli's sword, plants it in the ground before
          his grave. Takes the BOOK from under her arm and opens it up.
          
          It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's original
          transcription and printed on the prison press.
          
          She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
          over Eli's grave. We don't hear what she says.
          
          As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible, LOMBARDI
          appears behind her.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    You know, you don't have to leave.
                    You're welcome to stay here with
                    us. You'll be safe.
          
                               SOLARA
                    Thanks.
          
          She stands, pulling Eli's sword from the earth.
          
                              SOLARA
                    But I gotta do what I gotta do.
          
                              LOMBARDI
                    Where will you go?
          
          BEAT. Solara looks at the sword, her fingers playing across
          its hilt. The blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun.
          
          There is a determined, purposeful look in her eye.
          
                               SOLARA

          EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAWN
          
          The sun rises through the fog on the horizon.
          
          The great iron gates grind open. Solara emerges from inside
          the prison, steps out onto the island rock.
          
          She is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots.
          Eli's old pack across her back. Hair tied in a neat pony
          tail. Atop that, Eli's ragged fur hat.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for the friend I made.
          
                                                                114.
          
          
          In her hand she clutches a copy of the newly-printed bible.
          Eli's sword slung over her shoulder.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Please watch over her as you
                    watched over me.
          
          MONTAGE as Solara walks back along Fisherman's Wharf...
          through the San Francisco rubble... across the Golden Gate
          bridge...
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    Thank you for allowing me finally
                    to rest. I'm so very tired. The
                    time of my departure is at hand and
                    now I surrender my soul into your
                    care, at peace in knowing that I
                    have carried out your will. That I
                    have done right with my time on
                    this earth.

          ...and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the
          desert wasteland. She looks up and down the road, then turns
          and heads toward the sun on the horizon. Headed east.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have fought the good fight. I
                    have finished the race.
          
          As she walks away into the sun, her lonely silhouette on the
          road reminds us of Eli as we saw him so many times before.
          
                              ELI (V.O.)
                    I have kept the faith.

          until she consumed by the rising sun and we

               MUSIC. TITLES.

               EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

               The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across 
               heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- 
               racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING 
               TRAWLER.

               FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

               A HUMAN CORPSE.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- 
               three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence 
               of death --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- Jesus, look at him --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- what? -- you never saw a dead man 
                         before? --

                                     SAILOR #3
                         -- look, look he was shot --
                              (nudging the body --)

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- don't, don't do that --

                                     SAILOR #2
                         -- he's dead, you think he cares? --

                                     SAILOR #1
                         -- so have some respect -- it's a --
                              (stopping as --)

               THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- 
               the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --

               THE MAN begins to breathe.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT

               A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- 
               SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN 
               down --

               THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the 
               door as --

               GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical 
               kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot 
               soul.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here 
                         somewhere -- give me a minute -- get 
                         some blankets -- get some blankets 
                         on him --
                              (finding the kit --)
                         -- here we go -- here it is --

               GIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as --

                                     THE CAPTAIN
                         Giancarlo.
                              (Giancarlo turns back --)
                         We pick him up? Okay, we have to 
                         pick him up. But that's as far as it 
                         goes.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         He needs a doctor.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't 
                         care. We've wasted two hours on this 
                         shit already. You do what you can, 
                         but we're not going back.
                              (pure steel now)
                         You understand me?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to the rest of them)
                         Let's get back to work!

               GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a 
               pint of rum he's got stashed and --

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS

               Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings 
               overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- 
               words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

               GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting 
               away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet 
               wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

               Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK -- 
               TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out 
               olive jar.

               Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE 
               MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- 
               tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at 
               all, and as it comes free --

               THE MAN'S HAND SLAMS down onto GIANCARLO'S and we SMASH CUT 
               INTO A --

               FIRST PERSON POV -- we are staring up at --

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're awake. Can you hear me?
                              (we're blinking --)
                         You've been shot. I'm trying to help 
                         you.
                              (we're trying to find 
                              our voice --)
                         You were in the water. You've been 
                         shot. It's okay now.

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (switching to English)
                         You're American. I thought so. From 
                         your teeth -- the dental work --

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're on a boat. A fishing boat. 
                         Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.
                              (he smiles)
                         It's the cold that saved you. The 
                         water. The wounds are clean. I'm not 
                         a doctor, but the wounds, it looks 
                         okay. It's clean.

                                     THE MAN
                         How did I get here?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You we're lost at sea. They pulled 
                         you out.
                              (we say nothing)
                         Who are you?
                              (still nothing)
                         You were shot -- two bullets -- in 
                         the back. You understand me?
                              (we try to nod)
                         Who are you?

               Long dead pause.

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

               The Trawler plows through heavy seas.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

               GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- 
               busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 
               THE MAN's hip.

               THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like 
               hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right 
               now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the 
               walls -- haunted --

                                     THE MAN
                         What if it doesn't come back?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (still working that 
                              tube)
                         I told you. You need to rest.

               Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense 
               of all this.

                                     THE MAN
                         I can read. I can read that sign on 
                         the door. I can count. I can talk...
                              (focusing now --)
                         What are you doing?

               GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

                                     THE MAN
                         What is that?

                         skin.
                              (turning back --)
                         You have a bank in Zurich.
                              (waiting)
                         You remember Zurich?

                                     THE MAN
                         No.

               GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? 
                         I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, 
                         it's not for me to be involved, okay?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't remember Zurich.

               GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the bottle --)
                         You drink rum?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He 
               turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped 
               against a locker.

               THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- 
               now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first 
               time, he smiles.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring 
               at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- 
               trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on 
               the steam and --

               The whole thing explodes.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY

               THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still 
               bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing 
               himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping 
               that it will hold some answer for him.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN 
               hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers 
               for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off 
               and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- 
               still setting it up, as we --

               INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

               One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing 
               before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at 
               himself.

               And then he speaks.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect French)
                         I don't know who I am. Do you know 
                         who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

               And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just 
               beading on his forehead.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect Dutch)
                         Tell me who I am. If you know who I 
                         am, please stop fucking around and 
                         tell me.

               No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?

               And what else is inside there?

               EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY

               SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but 
               healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting 
               healthy.

               EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN

               A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.

               INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME

               THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling 
               some cash from his pocket --

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the money)
                         It's not much, but it should get you 
                         to Switzerland.

                                     THE MAN
                         I won't forget this.

               GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and --

               INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

               The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT.

                                     TICKET AGENT
                         Una sola via?

                                     THE MAN
                         Si. One way. Una sola via.

               EXT. TGV -- DAY

               A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow- 
               capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...

               INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY

               ...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- 
               normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to 
               the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking 
               at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into 
               darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

               EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

               ...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER 
               SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.

               INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African 
               ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in 
               some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a 
               translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is 
               NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (he speaks english)
                         ...no, no, no -- the time is not 
                         right, my enemies are too strong. 
                         I'm telling you to wait for this, 
                         you understand? I'm telling you this, 
                         and I'm making a warning to all those 
                         peoples out there that think that my 
                         powers have become so weak that they 
                         can play with me as they wish. You 
                         will see -- I will tell you when the 
                         evidence is clear. Then you will 
                         have a story. My old friends will 
                         hear about themselves.
                              (stopping, freezing 
                              on that image, and --)

               MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in 
                         Paris the day before yesterday. I'm 
                         sure most of you have a passing 
                         knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of 
                         you on the African desks have worked 
                         with him over the years. Some of you 
                         very closely...

               TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in 
               detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but 
               the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a 
               sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

                                     MARSHALL
                         ...He was an irritation before he 
                         took power. He was a problem when he 
                         was in power. And he's been a disaster 
                         for us in exile.
                              (the tape --)
                         Wombosi likes to send us messages 
                         through the European media. This is 
                         an interview we pulled down from a 
                         local German television station in 
                         Dresden. We've been getting these 
                         little broadsides every couple of 
                         months. He knows this -- he knows 
                         that -- he's writing a book about 
                         the Agency's history in Africa -- 
                         he's going to name names. It's 
                         basically a shakedown...

               ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest 
               otherwise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This interview -- and I'll make the 
                         tape available for anyone who wants 
                         it -- he goes on to claim that he 
                         has just survived an assassination 
                         attempt. He says it's us. He says 
                         he's got proof.
                              (beat)
                         The overwhelming negative 
                         ramifications of this should be 
                         obvious.
                              (hard and dry)
                         The Director wants to know if there 
                         is any possible shred of truth in 
                         this accusation.

               Long pause. No hands go up.

               INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

               THE MAN wandering through the terminal. Passing A PIZZA PLACE 
               closing up for the night.

               THE MAN checks his funds. Just enough for one cold slice.

               EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT

               THE MAN walking aimlessly.

               EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly 
               but this will have to do until morning.

               Just settling in, when --

                                     ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
                              (authority German)
                         Can't you read the signs?

               THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         On your feet. Let's go. Right now.

               THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         The park is closed. There's no 
                         sleeping in the park.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         Let's see some identification.

               THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         Come on. Your papers. Let's go.

                                     THE MAN
                         I've lost them. I've...
                              (German now)
                         My papers. They are lost.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                              (not sympathetic)
                         Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (pulling his nightstick)
                          -- come on -- hands up -- up --

               THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up 
               to pat him down --

                                     THE MAN
                         -- look, I'm just trying to sleep 
                         okay? --
                              (German again)
                          -- I just need to sleep --

               ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with 
               the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last 
               thing he'll remember because --

               THE MAN is in motion.

               A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off 
               guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat 
               and --

               COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but 
               THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single 
               fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

               COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to 
               fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just 
               unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- 
               down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood 
               spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

               COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- 
               struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down -- 
               like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- 
               COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

               THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's 
               got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the 
               edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (gasping, pleading)
                         -- no -- please God no -- please 
                         don't -- please no -- my Go

               -- stopping as --

               THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --

               This fight is over.

               THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops 
               at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did 
               he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it 
               just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- 
               holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done 
               a million times before...

               This is something he definitely knows how to do.

               And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off 
               into the darkness --

               INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY

               A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled 
               and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within 
               the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like 
               a suite.

               Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for 
               communications. A couple for research. People are at their 
               posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. 
               This is a place under siege.

               ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. 
               He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading 
               toward the boss's little office at the back --

               TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square 
               jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air. 
               Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.

                                     CONKLIN
                              (looking up)
                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Abbott wants to talk.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Tell him we're busy.

                                     ZORN
                         I tried.

               INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It 
                         looks like rain and I don't have a 
                         thing to wear.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I don't know what we're talking about.

                                     ABBOTT
                         We're talking about Marseille. We're 
                         talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And 
                         I'm asking you if this abortion in 
                         Marseille has anything to do with 
                         Treadstone.
                              (silence)
                         Was this Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're asking me a direct question?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I thought you were never going to do 
                         that.

               Silence. Pressure drop.

                                     ABBOTT
                         They're putting together an agency 
                         oversight committee. They're going 
                         to look through everyone's budgets. 
                         Treadstone is a rather sizable line 
                         item in my ledger.
                              (beat)
                         What am I going to do about that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You'd want to make that go away. 
                         You'd want to remind them that 
                         Treadstone is a training organization. 
                         That it's all theoretical. You'd 
                         want to sign off on that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         And what if I couldn't do that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. 
                         And you'd have to explain how you 
                         let me get this far.
                              (silence)
                         Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, 
                         does it?
                              (Abbott staring)
                         We'll clean up the field. You clean 
                         up your budgets.

               EXT. ZURICH -- DAY

               Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.

               GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on 
               this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO 
               GUARDS unlocking the front door and --

               THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking 
               for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --

               INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

               Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Can I help you?

               THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place.

                                     THE MAN
                         I'm here about a numbered account.

               THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                              (instant English)
                         If you'll just enter your account 
                         number here I'll direct you to the 
                         appropriate officer.

               THE MAN takes the pen, as we --

               INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

               A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the 
               Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.

               THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine. 
               Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him? 
               What if it's not?

                                     BANK GUARD #1
                         They've been waiting your hand, sir...

               THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his 
               open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

               THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave 
               of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

               INT. BANK HALLWAY -- DAY

               THE MAN being led by A THIRD GUARD to a special elevator.

               INT. DEEPER INSIDE THE BANK -- DAY

               Elevator doors open. THE MAN steps out. MR. APFEL -- anal 
               Zurich banker -- waiting there.

                                     APFEL
                         Good morning, sir. I assume you're 
                         here about your box.

                                     THE MAN
                         ...yes...
                              (what now?)
                         The box.

               APFEL nods. Gestures down the corridor --

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

               Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting 
               there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX 
               before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind 
               him.

               THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him. 
               This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.

               THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-
               up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's 
               license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason 
               Bourne.

               THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding 
               them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to 
               believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason 
               Bourne.

                                     BOURNE
                         My name is Jason Bourne.
                              (sounds good)
                         Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason 
                         Bourne, nice to meet you.

               BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's 
               Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb. 
               Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.

               BOURNE setting these things aside.  Lifting the top tray.  
               Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A 
               very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...

               FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with 
               his photo inside. Five different names. Three different 
               Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a 
               piece of card stock that says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

               And a bar code. 
               Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.

               And...

               There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in 
               place. And no passport. This card reads:

               NAME: John Michael Kane 
               NATIONALITY: U.S.A. 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France 
               There's a signature sample. 
               And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

               BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

                                     BOURNE
                         Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I 
                         live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.

               But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for 
               one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The 
               gun...

               Suddenly, it's all fucked up.

               BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's 
               a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing 
               one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...

               The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT OUTER AREA -- DAY

               BOURNE is done. Handing the box back to THE DEPOSIT GUARD --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm trying to think how long it's 
                         been since I was here.

                                     DEPOSIT GUARD
                         I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.

               EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS

               BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's 
               walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.

               BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- 
               turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --

               BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- 
               but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking 
               this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --

               BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse 
               starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a 
               cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from 
               behind him --

               It's just an ambulance.

               BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- 
               there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- 
               she's staring at him and --

               BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay 
               small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

               THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling 
               her radio and --

               BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing 
               himself not to run -- glancing back and --

               THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- 
               he's got his radio out and --

               FINALLY TO --

               BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --

               EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

               Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing 
               guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people 
               coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as 
               he heads for the entrance.

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

               The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant 
               on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a 
               marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in 
               open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American 
               tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for 
               visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem.

               BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. 
               What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, 
               and the incident in the park, then the bank...

                                     MARIE (O.S.)
                         -- no, this is not my current address. 
                         It was my current address two days 
                         ago when I started standing in line 
                         outside --

               A NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy. 
               Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because 
               this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode.

                                     MARIE
                         -- and so now I lost my apartment, I 
                         have no address, and I have no visa, 
                         and you keep telling me how much 
                         help you cannot give me!

               A CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights.

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna 
                         have to ask you to keep your voice 
                         down.

                                     MARIE
                         All the papers -- all the papers 
                         they asked for -- I brought all the 
                         papers --

                                     CLERK
                         Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you 
                         entered into a fraudulent marriage 
                         in an effort to circumvent the 
                         immigration laws of the United States --

                                     MARIE
                         You only know that because I told 
                         you!
                              (she's incredulous)
                         Ask the case officer -- find his 
                         name -- it's on the papers -- I told 
                         him all this myself! --
                              (tearing through the 
                              papers now --)

                                     CLERK
                         -- it's not the source of the 
                         information that's important here --

               BOURNE on line. Fear meter rising by the minute.

               BOURNE'S POV

               Scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- A TURKISH 
               MAN almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a 
               DESK CLERK -- TWO AMERICAN BACKPACKERS that have lost their 
               passports -- MARIE still in the midst of her madness -- A 
               SECURITY CAMERA high on the wall capturing everything -- 
               lots of data -- too much going on and --

                                     MAN ON LINE (O.S.)
                              (from behind him)
                         You're up.

               BOURNE comes to. Shit. It's his turn.

               A WOMAN CLERK waving him forward. BOURNE trying to think -- 
               what the fuck is he doing? -- what's he gonna say? -- now 
               he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly 
               face, he came to the wrong place --

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                              (cold shit)
                         You're a U.S. Citizen?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.
                              (pause)
                         I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Well, either you are, or you aren't.

                                     BOURNE
                         Right.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         You have your passport?

                                     BOURNE
                         I have a passport. I've got...
                              (the bag there, but...)
                         Actually, it's a little complicated.

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Do you have your passport, sir?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, maybe I should just...

                                     WOMAN CLERK
                         Sir, you waited on line.

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, I know...

               But he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the 
               window, the room -- he's out of here --

               INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY -- DAY

               BOURNE on the move -- hustling back toward the lobby -- trying 
               to snag a view out to the street -- there's a window just 
               ahead and --

               BOURNE'S WINDOW POV -- ZURICH COPS -- outside -- on the street -- 
               half-a-dozen of them lingering around the entry gate and --

               BOURNE stalled for a moment -- options dwindling -- he can't 
               go back to the passport office -- he can't go out the front 
               and --

               The lobby looks tough -- there are two other points of entry 
               into the main building, but they're both guarded by MARINES 
               and METAL DETECTORS --

               As he gets closer -- it gets worse --

               A ZURICH POLICE INSPECTOR near the door, in deep conversation 
               with TWO MARINES and THE EMBASSY SECURITY OFFICER and --

               BOURNE trying to burrow through the human traffic -- trying 
               to get to THE LARGER OF THE TWO ENTRY GATES -- this one the 
               farthest from the front door and the passport office corridor, 
               and it's the most crowded -- A COUPLE PEOPLE lined up here -- 
               waiting for one of THE THREE MARINES STAFFING THIS POST to 
               check their bags and pass them through a metal detector and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)
                         -- stop! -- stop right there! --

               BOURNE turns back -- as does everyone else in the lobby --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                              (from across the lobby)
                         -- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag -- 
                         stop right there! -- hands up! --

               BOURNE glancing back -- ONE OF THE GATE MARINES BEHIND HIM -- 
               the guy's raising his M-16 --

                                     GUN MARINE
                         -- you heard him -- let's move it! -- 
                         down -- let's go! --

               BOURNE nodding -- total compliance -- starting to drop -- 
               but only starting, because now --

               He's swinging the backpack and --

               THE GUN MARINE -- nailed -- blind-sided -- no chance and --

               BOURNE -- all motion -- all forward -- all perfect -- vaulting 
               the metal detector even as he pulls ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON 
               LINE around to shield his back and --

               ANOTHER GATE MARINE -- right there -- trying to grab him -- 
               making his move -- BOURNE -- almost an afterthought -- his 
               boot -- like a knife -- out of nowhere -- SNAP! -- the guy's 
               arm just shattered and --

               THE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM -- 
               they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby 
               and --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                         -- no -- no -- hold your fire! --

               BOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away 
               from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the 
               backpack and --

                                     SOMEONE SCREAMING
                         -- he's got a gun! -- he's got a 
                         gun! --

               And he does -- BOURNE with the M-16! -- coming up with it -- 
               coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches 
               for an escape route and THE GUN -- it's like a magic wand of 
               hysteria --

               PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY -- SCREAMING -- diving away -- everyone 
               dropping for cover and --

               BOURNE -- bailing -- on the run -- sprinting down a hallway -- 
               tossing away the M-16 as he sprints into the building --

               ARMED MARINES all piling in -- ready to rock but there's no 
               one to shoot -- no target --

                                     SECURITY CHIEF
                         -- check the closets! -- get those 
                         back doors covered -- there's a 
                         kitchen back there -- go! -- go! -- 
                         go!

               TWO MARINES -- scanning the windows -- looking down and --

               MARINE POV -- all clear -- no way he went down there and --

               EXT. U.S. CONSULATE BUILDING WALL -- DAY

               BOURNE still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's 
               no choice -- he has to go down --

               BOURNE finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching 
               down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --

               BOURNE hesitates. Does he know how to do this or not? Stalled 
               for a moment, then...

               BOURNE starts climbing down. And this is all one shot. No 
               cutaway. No cheating.

               We are watching a master at work...

               Handhold to a drain pipe. Swinging to a better ledge.

               Dropping to an air-conditioner. Grabbing a window frame just 
               before the air-conditioner gives way. Teetering there. Now 
               he's on the fourth floor.

               Below, there's an open window on the third floor. Struggling 
               to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight 
               of the bag, and as he does --

               THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the 
               open window. Now he's got to go all the way.

               Timing his next move and --

               He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe 
               and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting 
               to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- 
               the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --

               BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one 
               last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough 
               to slow his fall and --

               Letting go for the last fifteen feet and --

               EXT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY

               A DOZEN MARINES -- pumped-up and listening to --

                         -- we're gonna go room by room until 
                         we find him -- so let's get teamed 
                         up --

               EXT. AN ALLEYWAY NEAR THE U.S. CONSULATE -- DAY

               MARIE storming away. Pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined 
               and --

                                     MARIE
                              (German)
                         Motherfucking sonsofbitches!
                              (a new problem --)

               A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little 
               red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich 
               parking ticket on the windshield.

               MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the 
               shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces 
               on the ground and stomping on them and then --

                                     MARIE
                              (looking up --)
                         What are you looking at?

               BOURNE standing across the car -- on the passenger side --

                                     BOURNE
                         I need a ride.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                         I need a ride out of here.

                                     MARIE
                         Oh, Jesus...
                              (backing away and --)

                                     BOURNE
                         Please. I don't want to scare you.

                                     MARIE
                         It's a little late for that.

                                     BOURNE
                         I've got a situation here and --

                                     MARIE
                         Get the fuck away from my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'll give you ten thousand dollars 
                         to drive me to Paris.

                                     MARIE
                         Great. You know what? I'll give you 
                         ten gazillion dollars to get the 
                         fuck away from me before I start 
                         screaming my head off.

                                     BOURNE
                         You don't want the police any more 
                         than I do.

               BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car 
               into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it.

                                     MARIE
                         Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         Get me out of here. Please.

               MARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               VIDEO PLAYBACK -- FULL FRAME -- fast forward -- a speeding 
               blur of images from a surveillance camera outside the Zurich 
               bank -- it's two days worth of footage -- they're scanning 
               for Bourne's arrival and --

                                     CONKLIN
                         go -- keep going -- go...wait -- 
                         stop -- you went past it --

               COM TECH #1 working the console. Freezing the image. Punching 
               it up. There it is -- BOURNE leaving the bank with the red 
               bag.

                                     CONKLIN
                              (staring at the monitor)
                         It's him. My God, it's really him...

               ZORN the phones across the room. COM TECH #2 at his console --

                                     COM TECH #2
                         -- we got a cross-ref ready to go 
                         here, sir, we're running hotel, 
                         airline, train, and medical variables, 
                         anything else you'd like?

                                     CONKLIN
                         No...
                              (still staring at 
                              Bourne)
                         Go ahead. Run it.
                              (coming to --)
                         Let's get a map, let's get a grid 
                         map on Zurich.

                                     ZORN
                              (holding the phone)
                         Sir...

               CONKLIN up from the console. ZORN waiting for him --

                                     CONKLIN
                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Zurich police are looking for an 
                         American with a red bag. Apparently 
                         he put two cops in the hospital last 
                         night.

               Silence. Like the floor just fell away. So heavy.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What the fuck is he doing?

                                     ZORN
                         Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying 
                         to send us a message.

                                     CONKLIN
                         It doesn't matter now. We've just 
                         got to be the first ones there.
                              (decision time)
                         Get everybody up. I want them all 
                         activated.

                                     ZORN
                         All of them?

               A moment between them. CONKLIN all steel here now.

                                     CONKLIN
                         You heard me.

               EXT. BARCELONA RESIDENTIAL BOULEVARD -- DAY

               Establishing shot. A grand house. PIANO MUSIC over this -- 
               someone butchering a piece by Haydn and --

               INT. BARCELONA GRAND HOUSE MUSIC ROOM -- DAY

               Meet THE PROFESSOR. He's a piano teacher. Late fifties. 
               Deceptively fit. He's sitting here, listening to a NINE- 
               YEAR-OLD STUDENT struggle through the music.

               And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --

               INT. HAMBURG CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               A boring, marathon business meeting. FIFTEEN MIDDLE MANAGERS

               Bald. Fifty. He looks dumb and piggy. Anything but. Sitting

               And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --

               EXT. A ROMAN CAFE -- DAY

               Meet CASTEL. He's thirty-five. Slender. Clean-cut. Easy to

               And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --

               EXT. A ROAD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ZURICH -- DAY

               The little red car parked. MARIE pacing around. BOURNE poring 
               over a map spread out over the hood.

                                     MARIE
                         So what's in Paris?

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to go home.

                                     MARIE
                         For twenty thousand dollars.

               BOURNE looks back from the map.

                                     BOURNE
                         I said ten thousand.

                                     MARIE
                         You have blood on your pants.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.
                              (beat)
                         Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.

                                     MARIE
                         No. No, that was too easy --
                              (pacing away --)

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait up --
                              (after her now --)
                         -- just wait up --

                                     MARIE
                         -- get the fuck out of here -- all 
                         this money, this crazy offer, I mean 
                         give me a fucking break with this, 
                         this is --
                              (stopping because--)

               BOURNE just grabbed her. Both of them shocked that he's done 
               this. He immediately pulls back.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I want a ride to Paris.
                              (wide open now)
                         That's all I want. I swear.

                                     MARIE
                         You swear?
                              (cold here)
                         That's great. I feel so much better 
                         now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want anything but a ride. 
                         All I want to do is go home.

               Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him.

                                     MARIE
                         You could buy a car for twenty grand. 
                         You could buy this car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't want to go alone. I want you 
                         to drive me to Paris. Like we're a 
                         couple. Like we're a couple and we're 
                         travelling together. That's all we're 
                         doing.

                                     MARIE
                         And I don't get hurt. I get twenty 
                         thousand dollars and I don't get 
                         hurt.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't hurt you.

                                     MARIE
                         What if I say no?

                                     BOURNE
                         Then I'll find another ride.

               EXT. ROME STREET -- DAY

               to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in --

               CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a 
               stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books 
               piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs.

               QUICK TIME CUTS

               CASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of 
               books. Taking the top book off. Opening it.

               INSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An 
               LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his 
               password and --

               CASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner.  
               Pulling away the top pile and --

               A METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening 
               it. An empty tray on top and --

               CASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking 
               out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets. 
               All of this goes into the empty tray and --

               CASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and --

               THE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom 
               compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're 
               looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the 
               Zurich safe-deposit box.

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo. 
               And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his 
               photo. Five different names. Four different countries. Each 
               one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that 
               says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE: 
               A BAR CODE: 
               Two Italian. Two Spanish. A Portuguese.

               CASTEL going for the Portuguese passport and --

               EXT. ALPS HELICOPTER SHOT -- DAY

               The little red car driving through The Alps.

               INT. THE RED CAR -- DUSK

               BOURNE staring out the window. MARIE driving. Long silence 
               until --

                                     MARIE
                         Just so you know, if you're gonna 
                         burn me on the money, you might as 
                         well kill me.
                              (Bourne looks over)
                         I was supposed to have this car back 
                         three days ago. It's not my car.

                                     BOURNE
                         I know that.

               MARIE staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in 
               time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck --

                                     MARIE
                         Shit --
                              (trying to settle)
                         Can I tell you how much you're 
                         freaking me out? Okay? Because you 
                         are -- you're completely freaking me 
                         out.

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry. Really. What do you want 
                         me to do?

                                     MARIE
                         I don't know. Smile. Sneeze. 
                         Something. You've got a bag full of 
                         money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it, 
                         I don't know...
                              (the radio)
                         What kind of music do you like?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BOURNE
                         Listen to what you want.

                                     MARIE
                              (out of nowhere)
                         Who pays twenty thousand dollars for 
                         a ride to Paris?

               There it is. And she wants an answer --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know. I don't know who I am.

                                     MARIE
                         Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

                                     BOURNE
                         No. No, I mean, I really don't know 
                         who I am. I can't remember anything 
                         earlier than two weeks ago.
                              (it's not flying)
                         I'm serious.

                                     MARIE
                         What? Like amnesia?

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, go ahead... put the radio on...

                                     MARIE
                         Amnesia?
                              (total incredulity)
                         You're saying you don't remember 
                         anything that happened before two 
                         weeks ago?

                                     BOURNE
                         That's what I'm saying.

                                     MARIE
                              (German)
                         Give me a fucking break.

               BOURNE staring at her. She's furious. She's downshifting -- 
               she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a 
               blind turn, as we --

               EXT. ZURICH BANK -- DAY/DUSK

               APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner 
               into a quiet side street and --

               Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM 
               walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely 
               noticing Apfel as they get closer and --

               As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue -- 
               he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --

               APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary 
               exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street 
               and --

               MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and 
               as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

               INSERT -- THE CELLPHONE -- MANHEIM'S HANDS working to retract 
               a syringe into the device and --

               MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...

               INT. PARIS MORGUE -- NIGHT

               Not the best morgue in town. Cold tile. A wall of freezers. 
               Death lighting. Now add some color. Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in 
               the flesh.

               Meet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children -- 
               two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole 
               crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES 
               are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy.

               THE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These 
               guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The 
               guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE. 
               Into it. Too into it.

               TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's 
               clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the 
               freezer lockers...

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                              (French)
                         Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...

               And he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see 
               it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible. THE 
               MORGUE BOSS barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly 
               as possible.

               DEAUVAGE -- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his 
               boss --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the fuck out of my way --
                              (pushing Deauvage 
                              aside --)

               WOMBOSI moves to the freezer box. Stares down. As if it were 
               nothing. He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse. And now 
               he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling 
               around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling 
               around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding --

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (turning to Deauvage --)
                         It's not him.

               DEAUVAGE looking pale as WOMBOSI slams shut the freezer.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (quiet hard fury)
                         So who's crazy now?

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars. 
               A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.

               INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT

               WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted.

               INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT

               It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet 
               tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two 
               at the bar and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got 
               the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk -- 
               the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's 
               been showing it to her --

               And he's got her attention now.

                                     MARIE
                         And you have no idea -- not a clue -- 
                         what came before that?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         When you think of it, before the 
                         ship -- before you wake up on the 
                         ship, what do you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Nothing. It's just not there.

                                     MARIE
                         Well, this is great.
                              (she sits back)
                         I'm sick of myself and you have no 
                         idea who you are.

                                     BOURNE
                         I kept trying things, I thought if I 
                         could find all the things I could 
                         do, I could --

                                     MARIE
                         -- you could put it together --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- which was okay for a while, I was 
                         okay with it...
                              (hesitating now)
                         But then -- there's all these other 
                         things -- all these other things I 
                         know how to do -- and this -- this 
                         stuff from the bank and...
                              (suddenly flat out --)
                         I think something bad happened.

                                     MARIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     MARIE
                         Sounds like you were in an accident 
                         or something.

                                     BOURNE
                         I was shot twice in the back.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so you're a victim.

                                     BOURNE
                         There was a gun. Who has a safe 
                         deposit box with a gun and all this 
                         money and all these passports?

                                     MARIE
                         Lots of people have guns. You're 
                         American. Americans love guns.

                                     BOURNE
                         I fought my way out of an embassy.  
                         I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- 
                         I went out the window and I was doing 
                         it -- I just did it. I knew how to 
                         do it.

                                     MARIE
                         People do amazing things when they're 
                         scared.

                                     BOURNE
                         Why do I? -- I come in here -- 
                         instinctively -- first thing I do -- 
                         I'm looking for the exit -- I'm 
                         catching the sightlines -- I know I 
                         can't sit with my back to the door --

                                     MARIE
                         You're paranoid. You were shot. It's 
                         natural.

               She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can tell you the license plate 
                         numbers of all three cars out front. 
                         I can tell you that the waitress is 
                         left-handed and the guy at the counter 
                         weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds 
                         and knows how to handle himself. I 
                         know that the best, first place to 
                         look for a gun is the cab of that 
                         grey truck outside. I know that at 
                         this altitude I can run flat out for 
                         half a mile before I lose my edge. I 
                         knew that you were my first, best 
                         option out of Zurich? How do I know 
                         all that? How can I know all that 
                         and not know who I am? How is that 
                         possible?

               Long dead pause.

                                     MARIE
                         God, you're not kidding, are you?

                         Abbott. He knows about the embassy.

               EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT

               A drone barn. Practically on the runway.

               INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM 
               laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying 
               there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been 
               like this.

               Just waiting.

               ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His 
               fresh credentials. And a photo of Jason Bourne.

               INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off 
               the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in 
               Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty 
               children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau 
               riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic. 
               It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat-
               out strange and menacing.

               It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry 
               all that through this next series of quick shots --

               Littered with toys. Children's crap everywhere. BODYGUARD 
               #3. Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African 
               cloth.

               WOMBOSI THRONE ROOM DOORS

               DEAUVAGE -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing 
               set of doors. He's trying to stay awake. Reading a spy 
               thriller.

               FINALLY TO

               WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM

               And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his 
               throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting 
               there by himself. A king without a country.

               Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a 
               bottle of Jack Daniels.

               Stewing.

               EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN

               Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE 
               alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.

               And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment. 
               Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap. 
               He looks around and --

               MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread. 
               A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been 
               washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.

               BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.

                                     MARIE
                         I needed a break.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where are we?

                                     MARIE
                         We're about an hour away.

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't believe I slept.

                                     MARIE
                         You were tired. Here...
                              (bread and soda --)
                         For twenty-thousand I like to throw 
                         in breakfast.
                              (he takes it)
                         So what do you dream about?

                                     BOURNE
                         I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm 
                         asleep and I can't wake up.
                              (he takes a hit from 
                              her smoke and coughs --)
                         I don't think I smoke.

               Another silence. She's watching him.

                                     MARIE
                         You ever think maybe you have a 
                         family?

                                     BOURNE
                         I thought about it. I don't know.

               She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?

                                     MARIE
                         I guess it's like Christmas every 
                         day for you, huh?

               INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's 
               smiling -- really alive and fresh and --

               CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture --

                                     ABBOTT
                         Who is she?

                                     ZORN
                         Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- 
                         six. Born outside Munich. Father was 
                         a welder. He died in '91. We don't 
                         have the mother. There might be a 
                         step-sister, we're trying to track 
                         that down.
                              (apologetic)
                         It's tough. She's a wanderer. She 
                         pops up on the grid here and there 
                         but... I mean, the last time she 
                         paid an electric bill in Europe was 
                         '94. No taxes. No steady employer. 
                         She's got three arrests. Two 
                         shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one 
                         in Germany. And she actually did 
                         three months in an Italian detention 
                         center for credit card fraud.

                                     ABBOTT
                         No political affiliations?

                                     CONKLIN
                         She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's 
                         a great one.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm assuming we're exploring that 
                         possibility.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We're exploring every possibility.
                              (tighter by the moment)
                         We are in pursuit. How much more do 
                         you want me to tell you?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Pursuit would indicate that you know 
                         exactly where he is.

                                     CONKLIN
                         No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly 
                         where he is.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes, well, I think we need some fresh 
                         eyes on this problem. I'm bringing 
                         in some people from upstairs.

               CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We've been down here for two weeks 
                         banging our heads against the wall. 
                         We've been sleeping down here. We 
                         just got our first lead fourteen 
                         hours ago, and now? -- now that we 
                         finally have something to work with -- 
                         you want to bring planning personnel 
                         down here?
                              (real steam)
                         I'd rethink that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I want a second opinion.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This is an operations desk.

                                     ABBOTT
                         I'm not asking.

               EXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY

               MARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass --

                                     BOURNE
                         Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...

                                     MARIE
                              (looking over)
                         That's it? Is that it?

               AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold.

                                     BOURNE
                         Four-fifty. That's the address...

                                     MARIE
                         Looks familiar?

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (staring back as they 
                              pass --)
                         No. Go around. Keep going...

               MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she 
               does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it 
               all in --

                                     MARIE
                         Where?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.

               MARIE angles into an alleyway. Cuts the engine.

                                     MARIE
                         So this is it, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess.

               Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.

                                     MARIE
                         I should go.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't remember any of this.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               He turns back. She's staring at him.

                                     BOURNE
                         Sorry. The money, right?

               Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack. 
               He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She 
               takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being 
               disappointed. Fighting it.

                                     MARIE
                         Okay, so...

                                     BOURNE
                         Thanks for the ride.

                                     MARIE
                         Anytime.

               Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, I don't know what's up there.

                                     MARIE
                         You got me pretty fucking curious.

                                     BOURNE
                         Look, you could come up. Or you could 
                         wait if you want. I could go check 
                         it out. You could wait.

                                     MARIE
                         Nah...
                              (hide the pain)
                         With you, I mean, you'd probably 
                         just forget about me, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         How could I forget about you?
                              (he smiles)
                         You're the only person I know.

               MARIE smiles. We've never seen it before. Worth waiting for.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT

               BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments. 
               One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it 
               is.

               J. Bourne.

               BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again. 
               Nothing.

                                     MARIE
                         I guess you're not home.

               BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to 
               get into it, when --

                                     CONCIERGE (O.S.)
                              (from the shadows 
                              inside --)
                         Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...

               THE CONCIERGE is sixty. Plump and proper.

                                     CONCIERGE
                              (opening the door --)
                         Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was 
                         wondering -- I haven't seen you --

                                     BOURNE
                         Here I am.

               THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen 
               him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like 
               here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.

                                     BOURNE
                              (he tries a smile)
                          I seem to have lost my key.

               THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         I've been ringing your bell. It's 
                         good you were away. We had some 
                         trouble with the hot water. It's 
                         been repaired.

                                     BOURNE
                         Great. We could use a shower.
                              (they look like shit --)
                         It was a long drive.

               THE CONCIERGE steps aside and --

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key 
               now.

               Turning it. And the door opens...

               Nothing...

               No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.

               INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond 
               that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely 
               impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.

               WE'RE MOVING NOW

               THE LIVING ROOM

               BOURNE and MARIE exploring.

                                     MARIE
                         It's big.

               BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.

                                     MARIE
                         This is like a real apartment.
                              (she likes it)
                         This is really yours?

                                     BOURNE
                         I guess so.

               MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to 
               soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he 
               passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become 
               familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --

               THE BEDROOM

               MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and 
               simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...

               MARIE opening an armoire...

               Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling 
               better by the moment as we go to --

               THE KITCHEN

               Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE 
               picking up a frying pan.

                                     BOURNE
                         This is my frying pan.
                              (and then --)
                         This is my spoon.
                              (trying harder)
                         I'm Jason Bourne and this is my 
                         kitchen.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One 
               toothbrush.

               AN OFFICE STUDY

               There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in 
               his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference 
               materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime 
               law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.

                                     MARIE
                         This is your office?
                              (from the doorway)
                         God, you live like a monk...

                                     BOURNE
                         All this stuff -- it's all about 
                         boats.
                              (looking up)
                         I think I'm in the shipping business.

                                     MARIE
                         See. It's starting to come back, 
                         yeah?
                              (he sort of nods)
                         You mind if I take a bath?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go ahead.

               MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a 
               moment. Dealing with it.

               And then he sits down in a chair.

               BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's 
               all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches 
               his eye and --

               INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the 
               dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.

               BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out 
               a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No 
               keyboard. Now he's really confused and --

               INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the 
               playback button and --

                                     PHONE MACHINE
                         "You have no messages."

               BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and 
               then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker 
               phone -- and then hitting redial and --

               THE PHONE stars dialing...

               RINGING and...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...

               BOURNE quick grabbing the receiver. Taking it off speakerphone 
               and --

                                     BOURNE
                         ...yes -- oui -- uh...

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.  
                         How can I direct your call?

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         Yes, sir...
                              (switching to English, 
                              thinking that's his 
                              problem --)
                         How can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason 
                         Bourne.

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, please...
                              (a long pause, and 
                              then --)
                         I'm afraid, I have no one by that 
                         name registered, sir.

                                     BOURNE
                         D'accord... Merci.
                              (about to hang up--)
                         Un moment -- un moment --

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         -- sir? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- hang on -- I need you to check 
                         another name for me -- hang on -- un 
                         moment, s'il vous plait --

               BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where 
               is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --

               There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of 
               card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

                                     BOURNE
                              (reading it)
                         Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael 
                         Kane?

                                     OPERATOR/PHONE
                         One moment, sir.

               BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots. 
               Checking the temperature.

               THE OFFICE STUDY

               Bourne still on hold. And then --

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                              (a new voice suddenly)
                         Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes, I'm here...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You call about Monsieur Kane? John 
                         Michael Kane?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes. Is he there?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         You are a friend of his?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I have some very bad news for you, 
                         sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to 
                         tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has 
                         passed away almost two weeks ago...

               Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he 
               interprets the silence as grief...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         There was an accident. On the 
                         motorway. Apparently, he was killed 
                         instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry 
                         to be the one to tell you this...

                                     BOURNE
                         ...I understand...

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         ...we actually, we were unaware for 
                         several days that this had happened. 
                         When they came for his things, it 
                         was made known for us, you see?

                                     BOURNE
                         Who? Who came?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         His brother. You know his brother?

                                     BOURNE
                         Right. Yes. Of course.

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         It's very bad this. Terrible sad. 
                         Such a young man.

                                     BOURNE
                         Do you -- his brother -- do you have 
                         a phone number?

                                     MANAGER/PHONE
                         I think not...
                              (quick French to 
                              someone in the office 
                              there --)
                         No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. 
                         He was here very briefly.

               BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even 
               goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane 
               is dead. And he had the passport.

               Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This 
               is bad. Danger.

               THE MASTER BATHROOM

               MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --

                                     MARIE
                              (calling out to him --)
                         She wasn't kidding about the water. 
                         It's freezing.

               THE OFFICE

               BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.

                                     BOURNE
                         Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...
                              (moving out of the 
                              office --)
                         Maybe it takes a while to get all 
                         the way upstairs.

               THE KITCHEN

               BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an 
               act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But 
               ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. 
               Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding 
               it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On 
               the move again, now --

                                     BOURNE
                         Yeah, it's cold in here, too...
                              (calling to her as he 
                              goes --)
                         Let's give it another minute.

               BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- 
               every breeze -- everything carries information.

               Standing still. Taking it all in.

               Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that 
               face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and 
               bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a 
               large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple 
               furniture.

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly --)
                         -- omigod! --
                              (she's behind him --)
                         -- what're you? -- no -- no --

               MARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing 
               there with the knife in his hand and --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not 
                         like that --

                                     MARIE
                         -- please -- Jason -- omigod --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- quiet -- quiet --

               MARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment --

               BOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- 
               motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down!

               MARIE hesitating and --

               BOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb 
               from a lamp beside him and --

               MARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off --

               BOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- 
               putting his foot on a chair in front of him and --

                                     MARIE
                         ...what are you doing?...

               BOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- 
               get under the window -- go! --

               MARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- 
               she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- 
               looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? --

               BOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- 
               over her head -- into that frosted window and --

               As she ducks down --

               As it SHATTERS --

               EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE

               PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic 
               weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and --

               THE FROSTED WINDOW peppered with holes and --

               MARIE on the floor as THE WINDOW SHATTERS above her and --

               CASTEL -- he's in the airshaft! -- hanging from an abseil 
               rope -- but off guard -- FIRING BLIND -- strafing the 
               apartment and --

               BOURNE kicking that chair across the room and --

               CASTEL reacting -- instinct -- moving target --

               THE CHAIR just strafed to shit and --

               BOURNE rolling away and --

               CASTEL -- he's coming in -- last pieces of window frame 
               CRASHING AWAY as he swings into the apartment and --

               MARIE -- right below him -- shit raining down as he flies in 
               and --

               BOURNE throwing the knife and --

               CASTEL -- turning -- too late -- the knife catching him in 
               the neck and --

               BOURNE -- in motion -- attacking and --

               CASTEL -- knife impaled in his neck -- clawing for it with 
               one hand -- trying to get off a shot and --

               APARTMENT WALL -- PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- gunfire 
               tearing wildly around the room and --

               BOURNE -- full-stop -- kicking the gun -- kicking it up -- 
               ROUNDS TEARING ACROSS THE CEILING and --

               MARIE -- SCREAMING NOW -- trying to crawl away and --

               CASTEL -- no chance -- off balance -- BOURNE -- his open 
               palm driving up into CASTEL'S JAW -- the body wants to fall 
               backward, but BOURNE has the guy's arm in his free hand -- 
               jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and --

               THE GUN CLATTERING FREE across the floor and --

               BOURNE -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into CASTEL'S 
               GUT -- and then down -- his foot -- down into CASTEL'S KNEE, 
               shattering it and --

               CASTEL is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring 
               blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone 
               torn through his pant leg above the knee and --

                                     MARIE
                         omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? -- 
                         what're you doing? --
                              (incoherent fear and 
                              confusion, German 
                              and English and--)
                         -- what is he? -- what've you? -- 
                         omigod -- what is this? --

               BOURNE ignoring her -- grabbing the guy's backpack --

                                     MARIE
                         -- what're you doing? -- Jason, 
                         please, tell me what's happening!

                                     BOURNE
                         Open it --
                              (tossing Castel's 
                              backpack behind him --)
                         -- do it -- what's he got in there?

               CASTEL -- eyes wild -- tries to make his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who are you?
                              (kicking him down--)
                         -- who are you?

               CASTEL -- crablike against a wall -- bloody hands leaving a 
               mess as he struggles to get to his feet --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- who are you? -- tell me who you 
                         are -- who sent you? --
                              (bearing down)
                         -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT 
                         TO TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT! --

               CASTEL -- staring back -- eyes wild -- mouth shut -- his 
               expression -- is it terror or pure steel? --

                                     BOURNE
                         WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

                                     MARIE
                              (suddenly from behind)
                         ...omigod, no...

               MARIE -- the guy's backpack -- something in her hand -- and 
               as freaked out as she was a moment ago -- this is worse --

                                     BOURNE
                         What? -- what? --
                              (attention split --)
                         -- what is it?

                                     MARIE
                         ...this is my picture... he's got my 
                         picture --
                              (holding it up, in 
                              horror --)
                         -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- 
                         this... this... this is yesterday --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- where does this come from? --
                              (to Castel)
                         How do you have my picture?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie, just --
                              (waving her back --)
                         -- just stay there! -- just --

                                     MARIE
                         -- he's got my picture! -- this is 
                         yesterday! -- this is me! --
                              (out of control now --)
                         -- where did you get my picture? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- let me do this, okay? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- 
                         he's got my picture --
                              (just apoplectic --)
                         -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- 
                         he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- 
                         look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- 
                         omigod --

               Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (muffled but urgent)
                         Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's 
                         going on? Is everything all right in 
                         there?
                              (-- and she keeps 
                              banging and --)

               MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding 
               and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just 
               impossible and --

               Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- 
               unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and --

               BOURNE bracing himself but --

               CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing 
               the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely 
               nowhere -- except --

               THE WINDOW

               CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and --

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- 
               sixty feet above the street --

               Falling and falling and...

               IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and --

               INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

               THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- 
               checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the 
               red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and --

                                     THE CONCIERGE
                              (still outside the 
                              door--)
                         --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- 
                         you give me no choice -- I'm calling 
                         them right away! --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- 
                         where are your shoes? -- Marie --

               MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the 
               picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just 
               happened --

                                     MARIE
                         He's dead isn't he?

                                     BOURNE
                         Marie -- look at me -- there's no 
                         time for this --

                                     MARIE
                         He went out the window -- why? -- 
                         why would someone do that?

                                     BOURNE
                         -- we can't stay here -- I can't 
                         stay here -- it's not safe here --

                                     MARIE
                         He came to kill us.

                                     BOURNE

                         here -- but we have to go now --

                                     MARIE
                         You knew he was coming.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.

                                     MARIE
                         I trusted you.

                                     BOURNE
                         You're wrong. I didn't know.

                                     MARIE
                         I don't trust anybody and I trusted 
                         you!

                                     BOURNE
                         I didn't know this would happen.

                                     MARIE
                         He had my picture! He knew I was 
                         here! He came here to kill us!

                                     BOURNE
                         And where is he now?
                              (that gets her quiet)
                         You believe what you want, but I'm 
                         telling you the truth -- I never 
                         would have brought you here if I 
                         thought it was dangerous.

                                     MARIE
                              (totally overwhelmed)
                         Oh, Jesus...

                                     BOURNE
                         You stay -- if you want, you stay -- 
                         it's okay -- it's better -- maybe 
                         it's better -- I don't know --
                              (starting to back 
                              away --)
                         But I can't stay here. I can't.

                                     MARIE
                         But the police --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- there's no time --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll explain it --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- how? --

                                     MARIE
                         -- there's two of us -- we'll tell 
                         them -- we'll just --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- forget it --

                                     MARIE
                         -- we'll tell them what happened --

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know what happened!
                              (huge here)
                         I don't know who he is! I don't know 
                         what he wants! I don't even know who 
                         I am! The only thing I know is that 
                         if I stay here, I'm never gonna find 
                         out!

               BOURNE -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it 
               on -- just about to make his move --

               She's standing there. Just utterly swamped. Lost.

                                     BOURNE
                         Come with me.
                              (she turns back, he's 
                              waiting --)
                         I can get us out of here. I know it. 
                         Then we can think. Then we can work 
                         it out. We'll explain it then.  Once 
                         we're safe.
                              (rock solid)
                         I can protect you.

               EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

               A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and 
               people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE 
               running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND 
               OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and --

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND

               THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away 
               from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris --

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- DAY

               THRONE ROOM DOORS flying open -- WOMBOSI exploding out into 
               the hallway --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this 
                         far -- out a body in the grave -- 
                         another body! -- no! -- this isn't 
                         over -- these people are not finished -- 
                         nothing will make them finish until 
                         they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi -- 
                         until I'm the one in the box! --

               SIX KIDS -- TWO WIVES -- THREE BODYGUARDS -- all startled by 
               this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia --

                                     WOMBOSI

                         -- he's sleeping! -- this man is 
                         sleeping at his post! --
                              (kicking the chair 
                              out from under him --)
                         -- I've had men killed for this! --
                              (but he's still moving --)
                         -- you think these people? -- these 
                         people who come for me -- you think 
                         they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- 
                         they spend all the day -- all the 
                         night -- all time thinking about how 
                         to put Wombosi in that box! --
                              (he's just gonna keep 
                              going, and we're 
                              into--)

               A MASSIVE ONE-TAKE TRACKING SHOT

               DEAUVAGE on his feet -- racing to follow -- KIDS scattering 
               out of the way -- THE WIVES completely unfazed and --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- there is no box for Wombosi! -- 
                         they don't have a box that can hold 
                         me! -- I know these people -- I know 
                         they never sleep! -- I know they 
                         never stop! -- they never stop until 
                         the knife is at their throat! --
                              (suddenly distracted --)
                         -- what is the window? -- this window 
                         is open! -- who leaves this open! --
                              (before Deauvage can 
                              possibly respond --)
                         -- this is a war, you fool! -- you 
                         think these people are like you? -- 
                         you think this is stupid people? -- 
                         careless people? -- these people see 
                         an open window, they reach in with a 
                         big hand and grab your heart until 
                         you die! --
                              (still rolling as--)

               WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO THE POOL

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- and it won't just be me! -- they 
                         don't just want Wombosi now! -- they 
                         want my babies -- they want my 
                         children! -- and I say no! --
                              (grabbing Deauvage --)
                         -- you leave that window open again, 
                         you better pray they kill me --

                              his ear in the 
                              distance and now 
                              he's trying to get 
                              there --)

                         this is a fortress now! Are we clear 
                         with this?

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         Yes, sir. All clear.

               WOMBOSI stops to look at DEAUVAGE. In the background, we can 
               hear A CHILD CRYING by the pool --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         This man is out there. Kane is out 
                         there. And they pretend he's dead. 
                         That means he's coming back.

               WOMBOSI moving quickly now and WE'RE STILL TRACKING -- taking 
               him into --

               THE POOL AREA

               FORTY KIDS going nuts in the water. ONE KID crying. WOMBOSI 
               like a shot -- picking the kid up -- drying his tears -- 
               making a funny face -- getting a smile as --

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment 
               up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER 
               working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. 
               ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from --

               MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An 
               eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence.

                                     BOURNE/TAPE
                         "Kane. John Michael Kane."

                                     OPERATOR/TAPE
                         "One moment, sir."

               MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         He's not lying. He's very highly 
                         stressed, but he's not lying. He's 
                         confused. He's aggressively searching 
                         for a way out of the chaos. This 
                         conversation, the video from the 
                         consulate -- the body language, vocal 
                         pattern -- it's my sense he's really 
                         lost here.
                              (beat)
                         I think he snapped.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Is that a medical term?

               She turns. Battle lines drawn.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You want clinical terminology? It's 
                         called, "conversation hysteria."
                              (to Abbott now --)
                         I don't know exactly how you train 
                         these people. I'm not sure I want to 
                         know. I'll take a guess there's some 
                         extremely rigorous behavior 
                         modification going on here.

               Silence. The idea dangling for a moment.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Let's assume that's true.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         You can only wind people so tight. 
                         Even machines break down.

                                     CONKLIN
                         This unit has an unblemished record 
                         of success.

                                     MRS. DOYLE
                         Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.

               they can't. Too many people passing by --

                                     CONKLIN
                         That was two hours -- two hours to 
                         get a second opinion -- and nothing 
                         changes. He's loose. He's out of 
                         control. It's very clear what needs 
                         to happen.
                              (point blank)
                         I have work to do.

                                     ABBOTT
                         What if he is working for someone 
                         else? What if he turned?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Turn? To who? Where does he turn? 
                         What does he have to offer? He's got 
                         nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece 
                         of equipment for crissake. Where's 
                         he gonna turn?

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT

               Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked 
               kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE 
               PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT

               HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in 
               this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking 
               wet.

               A new hair color.

               A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and 
               wonder.

               And then she smells something. Smoke...

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And 
               the smoke is coming from...

               HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE 
               holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- 
               bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just 
               before it burns his fingers and --

               BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's 
               holding out her passport --

               He looks at her. Big moment.

                                     BOURNE
                         No.
                              (he won't do it)
                         You know who you are. You know what 
                         that's worth? That's everything.
                              (pause)
                         I can't live like this. I can't do 
                         anything until I know who I am. 
                         Believe me, you don't want what I 
                         have.

               He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His 
               shoulder.

               BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. 
               Doesn't know how to react.

               MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he 
               hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's 
               taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- 
               both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- 
               he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's 
               overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this 
               happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's 
               pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you 
               know the rest...

               INT. CDG AIRPORT -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris.  Coming through the terminal 
               as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --

                   ...................................................

               HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY

               HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the 
               phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the 
               place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."

               And so begins, the investigation...

               Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or 
               Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene 
               could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're 
               not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene 
               is not finished.

               The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne 
               would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he 
               was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever 
               "social engineering" needs doing.

               Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. 
               Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.

               Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan 
               rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a 
               hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks 
               very much different than we've ever seen her before.

               She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the 
               desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some 
               sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel 
               to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- 
               gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne 
               waiting and --

                   ...................................................

               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY

               Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's 
               on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not 
               being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! -- 
               she's got the hotel record in hand --

                                     MARIE
                         You stayed there five times in the 
                         past six months. But I didn't have 
                         time -- I could only get the bill 
                         from the last stay -- you were there 
                         for two days. Some room service -- 
                         there's half a dozen phone calls 
                         here so that's someth--

                                     BOURNE
                              (cutting her off)
                         Who paid the bill?

                                     MARIE
                         It's a company... MPG Capital.

               INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY

               Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled 
               up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there 
               staring.

                                     MARIE
                         This can't be it.

               She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a 
               piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful 
               and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking 
               the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a 
               rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the 
               glass door --

               And as he's doing this, we're hearing --

                                     TELEPHONE VOICE (OVER)
                              (British, female)

                                     BOURNE'S VOICE (OVER)
                         Hey, how are you. I'm trying to reach 
                         Richard? Is he there.

               We're watching the MPG LOGO emerge and seeing BOURNE and 
               MARIE react, as we hear --

                                     TELEPHONE VOICE
                         I'm afraid there's no Richard here.
                              (continuing into --)

               INT./EXT. SHITBAG PARISIAN PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's 
               got a pad and paper. This is all business.

                                     BOURNE
                         Well, where are you? Where am I 
                         calling?

                                     TELEPHONE VOICE

                         The company's located in Southampton, 
                         but --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- this is a tire dealership, right?

                                     TELEPHONE VOICE
                         No sir, this is a navigational chart 
                         registry. I'm afraid you have the 
                         wrong number.

               Dial tone. BOURNE making a note. And as he does --

               TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number two --

                         help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         Hey, so this is the Marina, right?

                                     NEW VOICE
                         Yes, sir. Can I help you?

                         This is the one in Marseille, right?

                         hours ago. Even if they stayed in

                         conditioned -- they're built to 
                         disappear. You give him another day 
                         to run and we may never find him.

                         This doesn't go upstairs.

               CONKLIN left hanging. ABBOTT clear on this one.

               and quite shocked to see...

                         Thanks.

               BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this...

                         Well...
                              (really thrown)
                         I must admit, when my assistant told 
                         me you were here I was, really -- I 
                         was quite -- I was surprised.

                                     BOURNE
                         Really.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We thought you were gone for good.

                                     BOURNE
                         Did you?

                         Well, I mean it's a tough business, 
                         isn't it? Cutthroat.

               A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.

                                     RAWLINS
                              (finally)
                         Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- 
                         but definitely at the high end of 
                         competitive -- when we didn't hear 
                         back from you, we did some re-analysis 
                         of the numbers, and honestly, we'd 
                         really like a chance to do a bit 
                         better.
                              (pitching now)
                         I'm assuming you're still in the 
                         market. It's the same vessel?

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     RAWLINS
                         We just picked up a job quite like 
                         the one we were bidding for you. 
                         Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- 
                         five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think 
                         we learned a few things that might 
                         allow us to make our proposal for 
                         your job, as I said, a bit more 
                         competitive.

                                     BOURNE
                         Okay.

               Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...

                                     RAWLINS
                         Was it the break-in?

                                     BOURNE
                         Excuse me?

                                     RAWLINS
                         We also thought we hadn't heard from 
                         you -- we've had a bit of a publicity 
                         nightmare, people have been talking.
                              (the meat)
                         Our offices were broken into -- 
                         vandalism mostly -- shortly after we 
                         last spoke.

                                     BOURNE
                         I hadn't heard.

               RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.

                                     RAWLINS
                         Let me get you a new copy of the 
                         proposal.

                                     BOURNE
                         That'd be great.

               INT. A CAFÉ NEAR LA DEFENSE -- DAY

               BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a 
               payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.

               BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and 
               literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting 
               closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a 
               list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in 
               the past...

                                     MARIE
                         I found it.
                              (standing there)
                         It took six calls.
                              (she's creeped out)
                         I found Kane. I found the body.

                                     BOURNE
                         Let's go --
                              (already standing --)
                         We got to get away from this phone.

               INT. PARIS MORGUE FRONT DESK -- NIGHT

               THE TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS watching BOURNE put down a hundred 
               dollar bill. MARIE standing a little off -- she will not be 
               comfortable in the morgue.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                              (picking up the cash)
                         What was the name again?

                                     BOURNE
                         Kane. John Michael Kane.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's number 121.

                                     BOURNE
                         I want to see the body.

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         Our boss could come back. We're not 
                         supposed to.

               BOURNE pulling out another hundred and --

               MORGUE FREEZER ROOM

               It's showtime. MARIE back by the door. BOURNE right on it. 
               ATTENDANT #1 pulling open the freezer and...

               BOURNE sags. ATTENDANT #1 looking baffled.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               INSERT -- FREEZER #121 -- it's empty.

                                     MORGUE BOSS (O.S.)
                              (from behind them --)
                         What the hell's going on here?

               Here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk?

                                     ATTENDANT #1
                         This guy, he came to see the American, 
                         but the body, it's missing.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         They came last night.  His brother.

                                     ATTENDANT #2
                         It's not in the book.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         Who are these people?
                              (now English to Bourne)
                         Who are you? What's going on here?

                                     BOURNE
                         Where did this body go?

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         I said, someone came last night --
                              (big attitude now)
                         Look, this isn't a carnival -- people 
                         call and they make an appointment 
                         and they follow the rules -- everyone 
                         signs in and out -- this is a serious 
                         place -- serious work -- it's not 
                         just to come in whenever you like --

                                     BOURNE
                              (like a shot)
                         Shit, we didn't sign in.

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         So get the hell out of here.

                                     BOURNE
                         Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In 
                         fact, I insist on it. Where's the 
                         book? I gotta sign in --
                              (off and running now --)

               Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --

               FRONT DESK AREA

               BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --

                                     BOURNE
                         Is this it? --
                              (the book)
                         -- this is it, right? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- slow down -- you can't just take 
                         the book like that --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- 
                         no problem -- just let me find the 
                         page --
                              (then quick to Marie)
                         -- honey, why don't you wait for me 
                         outside, okay? --

               MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's 
               doing --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- we have rules here, this is a 
                         very serious place -- I'm the one 
                         who decides who gets in here, okay? --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- what do I? -- I put the name of 
                         the person I came to see? --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- this is serious business down 
                         here and we cannot have people coming 
                         and going --

                                     BOURNE
                         -- here we go -- I found it --

               But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out 
               of the book --

                                     MORGUE BOSS
                         -- what are you? -- what are you 
                         doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped 
                         the book! -- you stupid fucki--
                              (no chance to finish 
                              this, because --)

               BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor 
               hit him. And fast.

               And that shuts up the room.

               THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss --

               BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door --

               EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

               Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE 
               struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning 
               in -- he's close -- he's hardening --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing? --
                              (he's scaring her)
                         -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...

               BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security 
               brochures -- scanning them as he walks --

                                     MARIE
                         -- I don't know what you're doing 
                         and you're scaring me -- what are 
                         you looking for? -- what just happened 
                         in there? --

                                     BOURNE
                         Nykwana Wombosi.
                              (he stops, holding up 
                              the brochure --)

                                     MARIE
                         What is that?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty 
                         million dollar yacht. He's the proud 
                         owner of an Alliance Security package.
                              (handing her the 
                              brochure --)
                         He also paid a visit to the morgue 
                         to see John Michael Kane.
                              (the ripped-out page --)

                                     MARIE
                         What does that mean?
                              (but he's walking 
                              again --)
                         Jason, what does that mean?
                              (she's trying to catch 
                              up, but he's walking 
                              really fast --)
                         Jason, please... who is he?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.
                              (he's not turning 
                              back again --)

                                     MARIE
                         So what are we doing?

                                     BOURNE
                         Go back to the hotel.

               MARIE just stops. Reeling.

               BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and --

               INT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT?

               ABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see --

                                     ZORN
                         They found him. They found Bourne.

               ABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Where?

                                     ZORN
                         You better come in.

               EXT. L'ETOILE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR -- A MOTORCYCLE -- screaming through traffic 
               and --

               INT. WOMBOSI'S SECURITY ROOM -- NIGHT

               VIDEO MONITOR -- there's BOURNE -- staring up and --

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         Jesus fuck, what is this?

               VIDEO MONITOR -- different angle -- more clandestine -- but 
               same deal -- there's BOURNE just standing there and --

                                     ABBOTT

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               BOURNE live. On the street. Bathed in a streetlight. Staring 
               up at a security camera.

               Total hero moment.

               I'm here. I'm waiting. I know you're watching.

               EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               Confusion to say the least -- WOMBOSI -- pistol in hand -- 
               moving as fast as he can through the clutter -- KIDS 
               scattering as he follows DEAUVAGE -- racing for THE SECURITY 
               ROOM --

               THE PROFESSOR on the speeding cycle -- closing in fast and --

               EXT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND -- NIGHT

               BOURNE standing there as the FRONT GATE opens. The moment. 
               The big deep breath. He's walking in --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               Uglier by the second -- desperation madness --

                                     ABBOTT
                         -- he went inside! --

                                     CONKLIN
                              (to Abbott)
                         -- if we can get a clean shot --

                                     ABBOTT
                         -- inside the house? --

                                     CONKLIN
                         -- that's what they're trained for -- 
                         just a surgical strike.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Forget it.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What do you want to do?

                                     ABBOTT
                         We don't know what we're into!

                                     CONKLIN
                         We're in the shitter, man! Pick your 
                         poison. Maybe he's in there to finish 
                         the job. Maybe he's working for 
                         Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV 
                         together. Every possibility sucks -- 
                         we've got to move!

               INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 giving BOURNE a serious pat down.

                                     BOURNE
                         Is he here?

               DEAUVAGE doesn't answer -- spinning BOURNE around -- they're 
               really going over him --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN on his feet -- ABBOTT beet red -- this is getting 
               loud --

                                     CONKLIN
                         You don't have the stones for this. 
                         You people come down here and wink 
                         and whisper and we send these guys 
                         out and get it done. And you're clear. 
                         And the guys upstairs get what they 
                         want. And the whole bunch of you are 
                         so stuffed on deniability it's coming 
                         out of your ears.
                              (gauntlet)
                         Well, you know what? You're here 
                         now. What do you want to do?

               ABBOTT just shaking his head no.

               And CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's 
               the button -- and he's pressing it and --

               THE PROFESSOR in position -- roof of the house next door -- 
               hum -- hum -- hum --

               It's the E-PHONE PAGER -- he's just been activated and --

               INT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               BOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE 
               and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as 
               he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to 
               the gallows --

               THE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and --

               WOMBOSI on the throne.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Come in.
                              (an imperial gesture)
                         Please...

               BOURNE steps up to the plate.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Did you bring investment advice for 
                         me tonight? It was tax shelters, 
                         wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.

                                     BOURNE
                         MPG Capital.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I think investment advice from a 
                         dead man, it's a bad idea.
                              (beat)
                         How does it feel to be dead?

                                     BOURNE
                         It's a lot more stressful than I 
                         thought.

               KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying 
               to scoot them out but --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         -- no -- no, let them in! -- let 
                         them in.
                              (to the kids)
                         Come in -- on y va -- come in...
                              (to Bourne)
                         I think everyone wants to see the 
                         dead man.

               BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         What do you do?
                              (on his feet now --)
                         You get an appointment with me? You 
                         make sure it's on the boat? You come 
                         visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit 
                         investment package. You drink my 
                         water -- eat my bread -- play with 
                         my children -- and what? -- two nights 
                         later you come back and you put this 
                         death --
                              (slamming something 
                              down onto the throne --)
                         -- you put this in my engine room!

               There is A BOMB on the throne now.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         So this is a different kind of 
                         meeting.
                              (steam building)
                         Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? 
                         One dead man to another.

               BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away 
               his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the 
               shirt --

               BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You see this?
                              (calling to Deauvage --)
                         I told you my shot was better!

                                     DEAUVAGE
                         He went in the water -- how did he 
                         live?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         No, no no...
                              (and he means this --)
                         This is a strong killer. This is a 
                         crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah...
                              (circling)
                         To make a killer that looks like 
                         you? This young? This face?
                              (he means this)
                         It's bloody fucking amazing.

               BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- 
               the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who do you think sent me?

                                     WOMBOSI
                         I know who sent you. I don't know 
                         why.
                              (this could get 
                              physical at any moment 
                              now --)
                         I learned many, many things from the 
                         CIA. Many things. I learned the way 
                         they think.
                              (beat)
                         Was the bomb on my boat supposed to 
                         go off or not?

               BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...

                                     WOMBOSI
                         You didn't set the bomb. Why?

               BOURNE not sure -- about any of it --

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Was this a game or a fuck up?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         Get the kids out!

               He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- 
               they're gone.

                                     WOMBOSI
                         And the door.

               DEAUVAGE closing the doors and as he does --

               THE PROFESSOR ATTACKS...

                   ...................................................

               THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN

               It's a shootout.

               The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the 
               bodyguards.

               Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

               No children are harmed.

               As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will 
               find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he 
               will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but 
               hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still 
               sitting there on the throne.

               There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

               This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive 
               action sequence just around the corner.

               So Bourne escapes. Physically he's just weary. Emotionally 
               he's fucked.

               All of that happens and we cut to --

                         anywhere. I'm shutting this down.

                         You're not doing shit. You're so 
                         scared you can't even think.

                         responding. Get out of my way.

               CONKLIN splits and --

               INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

               It's really late. BOURNE enters the room. MARIE in the corner. 
               Smoked out. Cried out. Lifed out.

               Silence. Not a word.

               His shirt is torn to shit. He scraped-up -- blood here and 
               there. He moves past her into --

               THE BATHROOM

               His hands shaking as he tries to wash them. He bags it.

               THE ROOM

               BOURNE comes out. And there's a long silence until --

                                     MARIE
                         It doesn't matter who you were before. 
                         It's who you want to be. That's all 
                         that matters.
                              (is he listening?)
                         We have this money. We have what we 
                         have. I had nothing before and now, 
                         I don't know, maybe I have more, 
                         maybe it's nothing, but...
                              (he looks over)
                         I say we leave here. We leave this 
                         place. We go until we can't go 
                         anymore.

                                     BOURNE
                         You could do that?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes. That's who I want to be.

               BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they 
               lay in bed. Just laying there.

               INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

               THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds. 
               Ignoring his pager. He's slipped off the grid.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN

               BOURNE and MARIE packing up to hit the road. Together.

                   ...................................................

               DOUG'S ROUGH DRAFT OF THE BIG ACTION SEQUENCE

               INT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- LOBBY -- DAY

               MARIE dropping off the key. Hope hangs in the air --

                                     CLERK
                         xxxxxx...

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               BOURNE enters. He's got the black duffel. Car keys.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they're headed for the door. Something doesn't feel 
               right for BOURNE -- and then he notices --

                                     BOURNE
                         Stop where you are.

                                     MARIE
                         What?

               Bourne turns back to the CLERK.

                                     BOURNE
                         Where's the dog?

                                     CLERK
                         My husband's out looking for him.

                                     BOURNE
                         He run away often?

                                     CLERK
                         That old beast? Miss his breakfast? 
                         Not a chance.
                              (returning to cleaning)
                         It's always something, right?

               Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different --

                                     BOURNE
                         Get in the basement.

                                     CLERK
                         What?

                                     BOURNE
                              (to Marie)
                         Get everyone down in the basement.

               Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning --

                                     CLERK
                         What the hell're you talking about?

                                     BOURNE
                         You're in danger. All of you. I have 
                         no time to explain.

                                     CLERK
                         Wait a minute --

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm sorry.

               -- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her 
               purse, clearing out of the room. Slamming the door behind 
               her -- click -- it's locked.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, 
               coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a 
               gun --

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it? Who's out there?

               And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer.  A box of 
               shells. Filling his pockets.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't let that happen.

               And he is moving down the small hallway.  Away from the front 
               door -- towards the back door under the stairs.

               EXT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- COURTYARD -- DAY

               THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of 
               the house -- coming hard -- and --

               The small courtyard is empty -- but now the ALARM is going 
               off -- and BOURNE turns back to MARIE -- races to grab her 
               as --

               RATATATAT -- The FRONT DOOR -- WINDOWS -- ARE SHREDDED and -- 
               here comes the PROFESSOR.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               And now they are running, across this little courtyard. To a 
               wall -- BOURNE is up, on it -- reaching down for MARIE -- 
               grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as --

               ABM!!! The PROFESSOR SHOOTS.

                                     BOURNE
                         Go!

               MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES 
               BACK TWICE -- RATATAT -- The WALL IS SHREDDED. BOURNE takes 
               off running -- reloading on the fly.

               Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a 
               WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to 
               explain -- he turns back --

               The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES 
               TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this 
               distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but -- 
               the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face 
               now -- RATATAT --

               BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching 
               MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER 
               POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --

               RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a 
               small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF -- 
               sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --

               A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a 
               large window -- and it's open. And they step through and 
               find themselves --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- BATHROOM -- DAY

               They close the window behind them -- catch their breath --

                                     MARIE
                         Did we lose them?

               BOURNE shakes his head. Tucks the gun under his coat.

                                     MARIE
                         Who is it?

                                     BOURNE
                         We have to keep moving.

               And now he is opening the door -- they step into --

               INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

               STARTLED KITCHEN WORKERS stare as BOURNE and MARIE calmly 
               walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door of 
               the empty restaurant. Quiet.

               And then they open the door to the street and --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- COMMERCIAL STREET -- DAY

               The first thing we notice is noise. The street is burgeoning 
               with life. The second thing we notice are SIRENS. POLICE 
               CARS approaching. BOURNE and MARIE head down the street, 
               blending in.

               Up ahead -- TWO POLICE CARS snaking through traffic. BOURNE 
               steers them off this crowded street.

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- QUIET STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are hurrying down this street when -- 
               BAM -- The PROFESSOR comes out of a building -- across and 
               down the street. No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's 
               FIRING.

               BOURNE tackles MARIE to the ground behind a car. RATATAT -- 
               The PROFESSOR is literally shredding it. And now BOURNE is 
               moving --

                                     MARIE
                         What are you doing?

               And BOURNE is on the offensive. BAM! BAM! Moving towards the 
               PROFESSOR who is ducking behind cars on the other side.

               They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each 
               other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends 
               of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two 
               flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now --

               THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed.

               THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive 
               into --

               INT. SMALL EPICERIE -- DAY

               And the PROFESSOR shreds the store as BOURNE attemps to fire 
               back. SHIT flying everywhere in here -- hard to see and -- 
               The PROFESSOR is advancing on them -- cops are no match for 
               his fire power. They move to the back -- kick open a door --

               INT. HIGHWALLED COURTYARD -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE cross this small courtyard, the PROFESSOR 
               is right on their heels. CRASH through a door -- and now 
               they are in --

               INT. SMALL SWEATSHOP -- DAY

               COUPLE of ASIAN WOMEN sewing in here. One MAN in charge -- 
               and BOURNE and MARIE charging through -- the MAN about to 
               say something -- but now the PROFESSOR is on their tail and --

               INT. SMALL AFRICAN SHOP -- DAY

               Making god knows what in here -- vats of something. Small 
               grouping of workers -- BOURNE shutting the door behind him -- 
               it's shredded with BULLET HOLES. BOURNE and MARIE racing to 
               the next door as -- BAM -- the PROFESSOR kicks the door open -- 
               BOURNE about to fire -- but there is a WOMAN right behind 
               the PROFESSOR! Can't do it -- turns to run as -- RATATATAT --

               The PROFESSOR FIRES as BOURNE and MARIE dive into --

               INT. LIVE POULTRY SHOP -- DAY

               And now CHICKEN feathers are flying everywhere -- the glass 
               at the front of the door is shattering. BOURNE and MARIE 
               make it through the gauntlet.

               EXT. BELLEVILLE -- STREET -- DAY

               And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into 
               his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the 
               car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their 
               car on and --

               BY MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And --

               THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas -- 
               they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires, 
               shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE 
               PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him -- 
               forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around 
               a TRUCK and they are free.

               INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE looking back nervously -- so far all over --

               ON THE STREET

               The PROFESSOR looking around. PEOPLE staring at him -- covered 
               in blood -- the COP racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for 
               long because the PROFESSOR is firing at him and --

               Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift 
               walk and now he's past the truck -- and --

               A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious -- 
               going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR 
               swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean 
               and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

               The PROFESSOR grabs the bike and takes off -- SHOOTING at 
               TWO POLICE CARS just racing to the scene and we are into --

               EXT. BELLEVILLE BLVD -- DAY

               HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving 
               because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster -- 
               much better armed.

               INT. MARIE'S CAR

               BOURNE driving. MARIE looking back -- seeing the PROFESSOR 
               gain on them --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And -- THE PROFESSOR FIRES -- SHREDS the back off their car --

                                     MARIE
                         Give me the gun --

               And now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window.

                                     BOURNE
                         Wait 'till he's close.

               BOURNE swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street -- 
               slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection 
               and --

               IN THE INTERSECTION

               CARS coming the other way, BOURNE just makes it through -- 
               the PROFESSOR tries to squeeze through -- skidding and --

               CRACK! The PROFESSOR hits the front of a car sideways on his 
               bike -- he is THROWN clear through the intersection, right 
               into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

               He gets up, grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike 
               and now we see --

               EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND PARIS -- DAY

               COPS are mobilizing -- swarming into this area and --

               BACK TO THE CAR CHASE --

               BOURNE and MARIE pick up a few cops on their tail -- shed 
               all of them -- the last car goes into an EXPLOSIVE FLIP -- 
               the PROFESSOR is now right behind them. And now we are into --

               CRAZY CAR CHASE WITH COPS RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL

               BOURNE, MARIE and the PROFESSOR leave a trail of totaled 
               cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally 
               saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we 
               are into --

               CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS

               MARIE'S CAR and the MOTORCYCLE can pass where the police 
               cars cannot. BOURNE may be able to shed the cops, but not 
               the PROFESSOR. And now one quick move and they are --

               EXT. QUAI -- DAY

               Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS 
               pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --

               The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over.  
               Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --

               MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The 
               PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE -- 
               she's totally exposed but --

               THE PROFESSOR -- his BIKE is SPOUTING GAS -- one of the 
               pellets nailed his tank.

               BOURNE AND MARIE --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

               THE PROFESSOR --

               No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the 
               barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and -- 
               BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone -- 
               the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police 
               cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their 
               side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and --
               BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies 
               down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them -- 
               the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike 
               sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and 
               BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.

               And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE

               SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street 
               they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running 
               out of options and in the background --

               THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars 
               and up ahead --

               THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns. 
               Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a 
               metro staircase -- only way out and --

               THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down 
               below.

               THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on 
               his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna 
               stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --

               THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car -- 
               BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it 
               crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.

               THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set 
               of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles -- 
               people diving out of their way and --

               AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked 
               out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out -- 
               head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a 
               lot more dangerous and --

               THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up 
               escalator -- people diving out of the way as --

               BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly -- 
               there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades 
               keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.

               UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep 
               staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --

               THE METRO PLATFORM

               The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down 
               the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them 
               and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side -- 
               travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for 
               long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They 
               skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED 
               STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the 
               platform -- take off running.

               THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but 
               it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.

               BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform -- 
               gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the 
               steps -- but here come --

               THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the 
               ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --

               BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and 
               there is only one option --

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off 
               the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN 
               STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into 
               the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the 
               button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching 
               the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's 
               racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of 
               the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE 
               PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off 
               the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks 
               but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating 
               towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing 
               into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train 
               in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks.

               IN THE LAST METRO CAR

               The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in -- 
               wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows.  
               And --

               IN THE FIRST METRO CAR

               BOURNE and MARIE finally getting a breather. BOURNE keeps 
               looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted. Finally --

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground 
               and as the train hits daylight -- we see the PROFESSOR 
               directly behind BOURNE on the other side of the glass and --

               CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming 
               his head into the metal as --

               BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the 
               PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --

               BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks 
               it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we 
               have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim 
               bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the 
               PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing 
               there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --

               A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated -- 
               the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks 
               like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --

               BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him -- 
               MARIE wields the shot gun.

                                     MARIE
                         xxxxxx

                                     BOURNE
                         xxxxxx

               And BOURNE takes the gun from her -- standing there -- 
               reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it --

                   ...................................................

               INT. MOVING METRO CAR -- DAY

               THE PROFESSOR sitting there. Like a dummy. Like a puppet 
               that's been propped up. He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged 
               with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood 
               flowing fast --

                                     BOURNE
                         Who else is coming?

               THE PROFESSOR staring up at the gun. Stunned. Doomed. Mouth 
               dry. Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos.

                                     BOURNE
                         I won't ask again.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I work alone. Like you...
                              (confused beat)
                         ...we always work alone.

                                     BOURNE
                         What do you mean?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Who are you? Rome? Paris?
                              (Bourne is just staring --)
                         Treadstone... both of us... I was 
                         warned but...

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...which one are you?...

               BOURNE lowering the weapon -- head swimming --

                                     BOURNE
                         Paris. I live in Paris...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...headaches... you have that... I 
                         get such bad headaches...

                                     BOURNE
                         Yes.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...it's a problem...

               He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

                                     BOURNE
                         Treadstone.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...or in a car... when it's dark... 
                         something with the headlights...
                              (circuits exploding)
                         ...pills, right? Treadstone had those 
                         pills...

                                     BOURNE
                         What is Treadstone?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...what did you do?... you must've 
                         really fucked up...

                                     BOURNE
                         I think so.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...someone said caffeine -- for a 
                         headache... doesn't seem...

                                     BOURNE
                         What do they want me to do?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         ...they won't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         Why?

               THE PROFESSOR -- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless --

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Look at this...
                              (all the blood --)
                         ...least you have a woman....

               And he's gone. Like that. Sitting there. And BOURNE looks 
               paralyzed too. Kneeling there. Stalled out.

                                     MARIE
                         Jason...

               BOURNE doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound -- 
               this pulsing hum -- BOURNE reaching into THE PROFESSOR'S 
               POCKET and --

               INSERT -- THE E-PHONE PAGER -- covered in blood -- hum -- 
               hum -- hum -- BOURNE'S HAND wiping at the blood that covers 
               the display --

               BOURNE staring at it. Very familiar to him.

                                     MARIE
                         We've got to go.

               INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

               BOURNE and MARIE racing back through the cars -- away from 
               the scene of the crime and --

               EXT. ABOVE-GROUND METRO PLATFORM -- DAY

               THE SHATTERED TRAIN pulling into the station -- doors opening -- 
               SCREAMS ECHOING through the station from up the platform and --

               BOURNE and MARIE getting off the last car and --

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY NEAR THE PLATFORM -- DAY

               Two minutes later. BOURNE and MARIE -- exhausted -- beat -- 
               Everything all at once --

                                     BOURNE
                         Take this.

               She turns. He's holding the locker key.

                                     BOURNE
                         Take it.

               But she doesn't move.

                                     MARIE
                         And that's it?

                                     BOURNE
                         If you're lucky.
                              (it's hanging there)
                         Take it.
                              (beat)
                         There's enough in there to make a 
                         life. Any life. Just get out now. 
                         Get low. Stay low.
                              (beat)
                         Take it.

               She takes it. Staring at him. Simply refusing to cry.

                                     MARIE
                         What was I thinking, right?

                                     BOURNE
                         I can't protect you anymore.

                                     MARIE
                         What about you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I'm gonna find the end of this.
                              (beat)
                         I can't protect you.

               MARIE takes one last look. And she's running --

               BOURNE hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and 
               then he pulls out THE E-PHONE PAGER. And it's pulsing like 
               crazy.

               BOURNE flips open the shell. There's a keypad in there.

               Holding it. Like a missing organ.

               INT. THE ZURICH AIRPORT MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

               Remember MANHEIM? He's still there waiting. And his pager 
               goes off, and --

               INT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               A safehouse -- CONKLIN filling a burn bag -- racing -- 
               everything's going --

               EXT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

               CONKLIN done with the dirty work -- out into the street --

               As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar 
               sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --

               He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below --

               Holy shit -- there's one of his E-PHONE PAGERS --

               He goes down -- picks it up --

               And now --

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

               CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? What've you done? Do 
                         you have any idea? Any conception? 
                         What you've destroyed? Do you have 
                         any idea how much time and work -- 
                         how many people have their lives 
                         wrapped up in this?

               So now you know.

                                     BOURNE
                         Are you Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Am I Treadstone? Me?
                              (peering at him closely 
                              now --)
                         What the hell're you talking about?

               BOURNE showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?

                                     BOURNE
                         What did you do to me?

                                     CONKLIN
                         What did I do? I spent thirty million 
                         dollars on you. I spent three years 
                         finding you -- four years training 
                         you --
                              (incredulous)
                         What did I do?
                              (staring now)
                         What in the name of God have you 
                         been doing, Jason?

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         They're right about you, aren't they? 
                         You're fried.
                              (on it now)
                         You really don't know what's going 
                         on, do you?

                                     BOURNE
                         I know you've been trying to kill 
                         me.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Of course. We had to try. We didn't 
                         know what was wrong.
                              (warming to this --)
                         We didn't know you were in trouble.

                                     BOURNE
                         So now you know.

                                     CONKLIN
                         So it's time to go home.

                                     BOURNE
                         That's all I get?

                                     CONKLIN
                         We'll make you better. We can put 
                         the pieces back. We can do that.

                                     BOURNE
                         I don't think so.

                                     CONKLIN
                         We have to go home, Jason.

                                     BOURNE
                         Jason Bourne is dead.

                                     CONKLIN
                         There never was a Jason Bourne.
                              (that gets him)
                         You have to come with me. It's the 
                         only way. We can give it back to 
                         you...

                                     BOURNE
                         Keep it.
                              (and he's walking --)

                                     CONKLIN
                         Jason...
                              (trying to follow --)
                         They can't let you go...

                                     BOURNE
                         That'll be their second worst mistake.

               And with that, BOURNE scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing -- 
               CONKLIN just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE walking away -- faster and faster --

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE NEARBY -- NIGHT

               MANHEIM -- A CAR PARKED IN THE DARKNESS -- sitting alone 
               with his briefcase. Opening it. There's his gun.

               BOURNE -- walking -- deeper into the darkness and --

               MANHEIM -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm -- 
               steady -- methodical and --

               BOURNE -- walking and --

               MANHEIM -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly -- 
               deep in the shadows and --

               BOURNE -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just 
               ahead and --

               MANHEIM -- raising the gun and --

               THE CAMERA SPINS TO HIS TARGET AND --

               IT'S CONKLIN! -- just climbing back up from the Quai --

               MANHEIM -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt --

               CONKLIN -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body 
               dropping like a stone beside his car.

               MANHEIM walks over. Looks down. Point blank -- phftt -- that 
               makes it four and --

               INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT and ZORN alone in the dark. As a red light begins 
               pulsing on the console.

               That red light means Conklin's dead.

               After a moment, ZORN moves to the console and shuts the light 
               off.

               EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

               BOURNE still walking. And he's just gonna keep on going, as 
               we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MARSHALL at the head of the table. A cadre of INTEL HONCHOS.

                         The Treadstone project has actually 
                         already been terminated. It was 
                         designed primarily as a sort of 
                         advanced game program...

               ABBOTT in the hot seat. ZORN right there beside him.

                                     ABBOTT
                         ...We'd hoped it might build into a 
                         good training platform, but quite 
                         honestly, for a strictly theoretical 
                         exercise, we thought it was far too 
                         expensive. The cost-benefit ratio 
                         was just too high. It's been all but 
                         decommissioned at this point.

                                     MARSHALL
                         All right, what's next?

               ZORN handing ABBOTT the next hundred pages.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar 
                         is a joint, DOD, communications 
                         program that we really feel has good 
                         traction to it.

               ABBOTT is just gonna go on and on and on.

               EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD -- DAY

               Gorgeous Summer day. A SCOOTER RENTAL SHACK near the beach.

               SIX MONTHS LATER

               MARIE coming out of the shack with two helmets. Handing them 
               to A HAPPY COUPLE waiting there on their scooters.

               THE HAPPY COUPLE rides off.

               MARIE turns back and --

               There's BOURNE. A new look. A smile.

                                     MARIE
                         Can I help you?

                                     BOURNE
                         This your store?

                                     MARIE
                         Yes.

                                     BOURNE
                         Think I could rent a scooter?

                                     MARIE
                         You have ID?

                                     BOURNE
                         Not really.

               Beat. He smiles.

                                     MARIE
                         It's not a problem.

               Her turn to smile. And we...

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Epic beauty: cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky 
               fringed with pink, as if the clouds were a lid too small for 
               the earth; a cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in 
               deep green grass; and the blue lochs, reflecting the sky. We 
               hear a voice, husky, Scottish...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         I will tell you of William Wallace.

               EXT. MACANDREWS FARM - DAY

               A farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a Scottish valley. 
               Riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are 
               Scottish noblemen in full regalia: eye-popping tartans, 
               sparkling chestplates. Even the horses are draped in scarlet. 
               Behind each nobleman rides a single page boy.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Historians from England will say I 
                         am a liar. But history is written by 
                         those who have hung heroes.

               Another noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear 
               down the road, converging on the barn.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         The King of Scotland had died without 
                         a son, and the king of England, a 
                         cruel pagan known as Edward the 
                         Longshanks, claimed the throne for 
                         himself. Scotlands nobles fought 
                         him, and fought each other, over the 
                         crown. So Longshanks invited them to 
                         talks of truce. No weapons, one page 
                         only.

               The nobles eye each other cautiously, but the truce holds.

               They enter the barn, with their pages...

               EXT. SCOTTISH FARM - DAY

               Nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and 
               barn and outbuildings of a well-run farm. The farmer, MALCOLM 
               WALLACE, and his nineteen-year-old son JOHN, both strong, 
               tough men, are riding away from the farm. They hear hooves 
               behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Among the farmers of that shire was 
                         Malcolm Wallace, a commoner, with 
                         his own lands and two sons: John...

               We FAVOR JOHN WALLACE, the nineteen-year-old sitting easily 
               on his horse, beside his father...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...and William.

               WILLIAM, a skinny eight-year-old riding bareback, catches up 
               to his father and older brother.

                                     FATHER
                         Told ya to stay.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I finished my chores. Where we goin'?

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit 
                         when the truce was over.

               They ride on, over the lush hills.

               EXT. THE MACANDREWS FARM - DAY

               The horses are all gone; the place looks deserted. UP ON THE 
               HILL we see the three Wallaces, looking down.

                                     FATHER
                         Stay here.

               He means William. He and his elder son spur their horses.

               AT THE BARN - DAY

               The Wallaces ride up, looking around.

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews!... MacAndrews!?

               Malcolm finds a pitchfork, John the woodpile axe...

               INT. THE BARN

               POV from within as the door opens and a widening block of 
               sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. Malcolm and John 
               Wallace step in, and are shocked to see...

               POV THE WALLACES

               Hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty Scottish 
               noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted 
               by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding.

               Malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger; 
               John still grips the axe as he follows his father through 
               the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see 
               the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs...

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews.

               A SHUFFLE; John spins; William has entered the back door.

                                     JOHN
                         William! Get out of here!

                                     WILLIAM
                         Why would MacAndrews make so many 
                         scarecrows?

               Before his father and brother can think of anything to say, 
               William, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of 
               the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. It's too solid; 
               he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly --

                                     WILLIAM
                         R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!...

               He turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged 
               man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction, 
               and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men 
               begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and 
               older brother to fight their way to him.

                                     FATHER
                         William! William!

               Then, worst of all, William sees the pages, boys like himself, 
               hanged in a row behind their masters!

               Finally his father and brother reach William and hug him 
               tight. There in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the 
               hanged nobles, Malcolm Wallace grips his sons.

                                     FATHER
                         Murderin' English bastards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLACE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               The cottage looks peaceful, the windows glowing yellow into 
               the night. From outside the house we see John rise and close 
               the shutters of the kitchen, where men are gathered. We PAN 
               UP to the upper bedroom window...

               INSIDE THAT BEDROOM

               Young William is in nightmarish sleep. He mumbles in smothered 
               terror; he twitches. We see

               HIS NIGHTMARE

               In the blue-grays of his dream, William stands at the door 
               of the barn, gazing at the hanged knights. We WHIP PAN to 
               their faces, garish, horrible... Then one of the heads moves 
               and its eyes open! William wants to run, but he can't get 
               his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated 
               tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...

                                     GHOUL
                         Will--iam...!

               WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing 
               back his tears and panic.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               A dozen strong, tough farmers have huddled. Red-headed 
               CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while 
               his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Wallace is right! We fight 'em!

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         Every nobleman who had any will to 
                         fight was at that meeting.

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         So it's up to us! We show them we 
                         won't lie down to be their slaves!

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         We can't beat an army, not with the 
                         fifty farmers we can raise!

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         We don't have to beat 'em, just fight 
                         'em. To show 'em we're not dogs, but 
                         men.

               Young Wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the 
               stairs. He sees his father drip his finger into a jug of 
               whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop.

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         They have a camp here. We attack 
                         them at sunset tomorrow. Give us all 
                         night to run home.

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               Malcolm and John have saddled horses; they are checking the 
               short swords they've tucked into grain sacks when William 
               comes out of the barn with his own horse.

                                     MALCOLM
                         William, you're staying here.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I can fight.

               These words from his youngest son make Malcolm pause, and 
               kneel, to look into William's eyes.

                                     MALCOLM
                         Aye. But it's our wits that make us 
                         men. I love ya, boy. You stay.

               Malcolm and John mount their horses and ride away, leaving 
               William looking forlorn. They wave; he waves back.

               EXT SCOTTISH HILLS, NEAR THE WALLACE FARM - DAY

               It's strangely quiet, until William and his friend HAMISH 
               CAMPBELL, a red-headed like his father, race up the hillside 
               and duck in among a grove of trees. Breathless, gasping, 
               they press their backs to the tree bark. William peers around 
               a tree, then shrinks back and whispers...

                                     WILLIAM
                         They're coming!

                                     HAMISH
                         How many?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Three, maybe more!

                                     HAMISH
                         Armed?

                                     WILLIAM
                         They're English soldiers, ain't they?

                                     HAMISH
                         With your father and brother gone, 
                         they'll kill us and burn the farm!

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's up to us, Hamish!

               Hamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Not yet! Here he comes, be ready!

               They wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the 
               grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling 
               rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter 
               as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes 
               down on their play.

               EXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN

               The boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky.

                                     HAMISH
                         Wanna stay with me tonight?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I wanna have supper waitin'.

                                     HAMISH
                         We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Aye, we'll get 'em.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               William's face appears at the window, looking toward

               THE DISTANT HILLS

               of trees and heather, where there is no sign of life.

               INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

               William has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two 
               steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he 
               is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still 
               all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside 
               the stew, and moves up the stairs.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

               The house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

               William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, 
               and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops 
               at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed 
               bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, 
               also unrumpled.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted 
               candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the 
               hogs, while he glimpses something coming.

               THE BOY'S POV

               An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is 
               Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers 
               glance up at William, their faces grim...

               From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors 
               have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart 
               stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where 
               more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the 
               ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt 
               of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         William... Come down here, lad.

               William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... 
               but the bodies are still there.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The 
               undertaker arrives in his hearse.

               INT. THE SHED - DAY

               On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is 
               preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the 
               head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.

               Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and 
               brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but 
               what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.

               William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to 
               him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.

               The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the 
               blood. But the wounds remain.

               EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY

               CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We 
               INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see 
               the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, 
               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as 
               the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes 
               into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.

               The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.

               The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's 
               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but 
               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.

               Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his 
               youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a 
               beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her 
               own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of 
               death and might suck her parents in too.

                                     PRIEST
                         ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.

               With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, 
               pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment 
               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.

               The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so 
               shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its 
               way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a 
               way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a 
               Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and 
               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.

               William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue 
               eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.

               Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill 
               above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, 
               he looks like the grim reaper.

               The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches 
               in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE 
               WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, 
               permanently furious.

                                     PRIEST
                         You must be the relative of the 
                         deceased... William, this is your 
                         Uncle Argyle.

               Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William.

               William stares up at this frightening figure. They are 
               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a 
               dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are 
               approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...

                                     ARGYLE
                         You were wise to hurry.

               The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down 
               from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque.

                                     LEADER
                         Someone dead from this household?

                                     ARGYLE
                         We just had a funeral, isn't that 
                         what it means in England as well?

                                     LEADER
                         What it means in England -- and in 
                         Scotland too -- is that rebels have 
                         forfeited their lands. We were 
                         ambushed last night. But the Scots 
                         dragged their dead away.

                                     ARGYLE
                         My brother and nephew perished two 
                         days ago, when their hay cart turned 
                         over.

                                     LEADER
                         Then we'll just have a peek at the 
                         wounds.
                              (to his men)
                         Dig 'em up!

                                     ARGYLE
                         They've been sanctified and buried 
                         in the holy rites of God's church, 
                         and any hand that disturbs them now 
                         takes on eternal damnation. So please -- 
                         do it.

               Outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of 
               the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Funeral's over. Go home.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               William and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle 
               has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Not that spoon, that one's for soup. 
                         Dip away from you. And don't slurp.

               Argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy.

                                     ARGYLE
                         We'll sleep here tonight. You'll 
                         come home with me. We'll let the 
                         house, and the lands too; plenty of 
                         willing neighbors.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't want to leave.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Didn't want your father to die either, 
                         did ya? But it happened.

               Argyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Did the priest say anything about 
                         the Resurrection? Or was it all about 
                         Judgment?

                                     WILLIAM
                         It was in Latin, sir.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak 
                         Latin? We have to fix that, won't 
                         we?
                              (beat)
                         Did he give the poetic benediction? 
                         The Lord bless thee and keep thee? 
                         Patris Benefactum et --
                              (beat)
                         ...It was Malcolm's favorite.

               INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands 
               awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand 
               and crawls into bed.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good night, Uncle.

               Argyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, 
               leans down over William... and with great tenderness the 
               grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Argyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds 
               the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks 
               at the handle, like a cross. He whispers...

                                     ARGYLE
                         "The Lord bless thee and keep thee..."

               Tears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks.

               INT. THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM

               Once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking 
               at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled 
               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William 
               gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his 
               father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they 
               smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches 
               to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding 
               hand.

               William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother 
               move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are 
               there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads 
               into the nooses, and hoist themselves up.

               William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and

               HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM

               tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still 
               grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               William moves down to the room where his uncle would be 
               sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- 
               but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to

               THE KITCHEN

               But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a 
               strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He 
               moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the 
               window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a 
               candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out 
               his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT

               William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound 
               of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the 
               moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he 
               realizes this, then forces himself on.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               William moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are 
               buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the 
               farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- 
               and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient 
               Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody 
               known to us as "Amazing Grace." Uncle Argyle has heard them 
               and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the 
               torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances 
               down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William 
               whispers...

                                     WILLIAM
                         What are they doing?

                                     ARGYLE
                         Saying goodbye in their own way -- 
                         in outlawed tartans, with outlawed 
                         pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

               The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each 
               whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to 
               William, and half to himself...

                                     ARGYLE
                         Your Daddy and I, we saw our own 
                         father buried like this, dead from 
                         fighting the English.

               William takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift 
               it.

               Slowly, Argyle takes the sword back.

                                     ARGYLE
                         First learn to use this.

               He taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Then I will teach you to use this.

               With an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It 
               glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging 
               in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising 
               towards the stars...

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               William and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has 
               a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as 
               if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does 
               glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - ROYAL WEDDING - DAY

               Amid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords, with 
               gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Twelve years later, Longshanks 
                         supervised the wedding of his eldest 
                         son, also named Edward, who would 
                         succeed him to the throne.

               LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of 
               the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly 
               legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's 
               nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct 
               cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line 
               of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         As bride for his son, Longshanks had 
                         chosen a relative of his rival, the 
                         king of France.

               GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty 
               moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her 
               blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her 
               hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control.

               She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men 
               surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and 
               goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         It was widely whispered that for the 
                         Princess to conceive, Longshanks 
                         would have to do the honors himself. 
                         That may have been what he had in 
                         mind all along.

               The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's 
               veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince 
               Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted 
               by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new 
               Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes 
               that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Having seen to his obligations to 
                         provide for a successor, Longshanks 
                         set about his fondest business -- to 
                         crush Scotland, and turn his power 
                         against France...

               CLOSE - A MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES

               Longshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Scotland! Scot-land!

               We are in the --

               INT. ROYAL ENGLISH PALACE - DAY

               Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the 
               outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly 
               afraid of him.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         The French will grovel to anyone 
                         with strength! But how will they 
                         credit our strength when we cannot 
                         rule the whole of our own island?!

               He punches the map, then sees the Princess enter softly.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Where is my son?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to 
                         come in his stead.

               Longshanks' eyes expand in fury; it is frightening to see.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         I sent for him -- and the little 
                         coward send you?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         Shall I leave, M'lord?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         If he wants his queen to rule, then 
                         you stay and learn how! I will deal 
                         with him.

               He spins back toward his generals. Ignored, the princess 
               settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Nobles are the key to the Scottish 
                         door. Grant their nobles land here 
                         in England. Give our own nobles 
                         estates in the north. Make them too 
                         greedy to oppose us.

               One OLD ADVISOR speaks up hesitantly.

                                     OLD ADVISOR
                         Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant 
                         to relocate. New lands mean new taxes, 
                         and they are taxed already for our 
                         war in France.

               Longshanks glares at him, but takes the point. The wheels 
               grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the Princess, 
               he is inspired.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an 
                         old custom. Grant them prima noctes, 
                         "First night." When any common girl 
                         inhabiting their lands is married, 
                         our lords shall have sexual rights 
                         to her on the night of her wedding. 
                         That should fetch just the kind of 
                         lords we want in Scotland.

               INT. PRINCE EDWARD'S ROYAL APARTMENTS - DAY

               The prince and a muscular young friend, PHILLIP, are stripped 
               to the waist and fencing. They pay no attention to the

               KNOCK, or to the Princess as she enters. She watches them -- 
               they are dancing more than fencing. Edward loses his sword; 
               it clatters to the polished floor. He looks up at his wife, 
               as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is it?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         You directed me to report to you the 
                         moment the king's conference was 
                         ended.

                                     EDWARD
                         So I did! And what was so important 
                         about it?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Scotland. He intends --

               But Edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of 
               their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He intends to grant --

               Edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shut up, would you! How can I 
                         concentrate?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...His majesty was quite keen that 
                         you should understand --

                                     EDWARD
                         All so very boring! He wants me to 
                         learn to fight too, so let me do it!

               For an instant, anger flares into her eyes. She glances at 
               Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes 
               and starts to back out. But Edward has noticed.

                                     EDWARD
                         Stop there.

               She stops, but does not raise her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Do you disapprove of Phillip?

               He lifts his hand and draws his friend Phillip to his side.

               Still the Princess does not lift her eyes.

                                     PRINCESS
                              (barely audible)
                         No, M'lord.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!

               She lifts her eyes. But she could not brace herself enough 
               for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's 
               bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men 
               glistening with sweat and sexual excitement.

               The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, my flower, do you understand?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Yes. I had thought that... I was 
                         loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I 
                         may be excused, M'lord.

                                     EDWARD
                         You may.

               She starts to leave, as quietly as she came. But her husband 
               calls after her.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal 
                         responsibility to breed. And I assure 
                         you, when the time comes, I shall... 
                         manage.

               She closes the door softly, on her husband and his lover.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Now in Edinburgh were gathered the 
                         council of Scottish nobles...

               ESTABLISHING COUNCIL - DAY

               The picturesque heart of Scotland, with its CASTLE on a fairy 
               tale plateau above the Firth of Forth.

               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY

               The nobles are gathered around a huge table. They rise at 
               the entrance of young ROBERT THE BRUCE, a handsome young 
               man, full of intelligence and power.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Among these was Robert, the 17th 
                         Earl of Bruce, a leading contender 
                         for the crown of Scotland.

               Robert strides to his seat in the center of the table, and 
               the others settle in respectfully. MORNAY, another young 
               warrior, gives him a bow, as does CRAIG, a grizzled noble.

                                     CRAIG
                         Young Robert, we are honored --

                                     ROBERT
                         My father hears that Longshanks has 
                         granted prima noctes.

                                     CRAIG
                         Clearly meant to draw more of his 
                         supporters here.

                                     MORNAY
                         The Balliol clan has endorsed the 
                         right, licking Longshanks' boots so 
                         he will support their claim to the 
                         throne. If we make a show of 
                         opposition, the commoners will favor 
                         us.

                                     ROBERT
                         It is too soon to step out alone. My 
                         father believes we must lull 
                         Longshanks into confidence, by neither 
                         supporting his decree nor opposing 
                         it.

                                     CRAIG
                         A wise plan. And how is your father? 
                         We have missed him at the council.

                                     ROBERT
                         He strained his leg so that it pains 
                         him to ride. But he sends his 
                         greetings -- and says that I speak 
                         for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.

               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

               Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families 
               have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy 
               bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of 
               cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of 
               smoked fish.

               And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, 
               battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.

               Riding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a 
               man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, 
               his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled 
               power. He looks dangerous.

               And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.

               He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he 
               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the 
               scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing 
               handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the 
               traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing 
               William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters 
               of marriageable age.

               Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older 
               now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William 
               dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English 
               SOLDIERS shoves William from behind.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Hey boy! You hunt this bird?

               William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.

                                     SOLDIER
                         It's against the law for Scots to 
                         own bows. You shot this bird?

               His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the 
               bird and begin to search it for evidence.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I hit it in the head. With a rock.

               They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture 
               wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return 
               of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground.

               Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.

               The farmers watch him come.

               Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not 
               to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young 
               woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long 
               ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her 
               back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a 
               wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, 
               maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William 
               notice her too.

               William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to 
               the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Miz MacDougal. You look well.

                                     FARM WOMAN
                         ...William? It's William Wallace, 
                         back home! -- Have you met my 
                         daughter?

               The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to 
               her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright 
               as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But 
               then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand 
               and gives her a respectful bow.

               He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like 
               a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He 
               sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember 
               each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes 
               downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.

               They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about 
               to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth 
               at Williams' feet.

               He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, 
               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's 
               way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle 
               the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him 
               off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Hamish?

               It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put 
               off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.

                                     HAMISH
                         Test of manhood.

                                     WILLIAM
                         You win.

                                     HAMISH
                              (blocks him)
                         Call it a test of soldiery, then. 
                         The English won't let us train with 
                         weapons, so we train with stones.

                                     WILLIAM
                         The test of a soldier is not in his 
                         arm. It's here.

               He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to 
               show William something in his palm.

                                     HAMISH
                         No. It's here.

               With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's 
               jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, 
               MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders 
               here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands 
               over William, waiting for him to get up.

                                     WILLIAM
                         A contest, then.

               William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in 
               diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to 
               the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are 
               the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run 
               and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the 
               field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I still say this is no test. A 
                         catapult can throw a stone farther 
                         than a man can.

                                     HAMISH
                         That depends on the man.

               Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the 
               line. He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone 
               flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet.

               People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Can you do it when it matters? As it 
                         matters in battle? Could you crush a 
                         man with that throw?

                                     HAMISH
                         I could crush you like a roach.

               William walks to the dent made by Hamish's throw.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Then do it. Come, do it.

               Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts 
               the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands 
               calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.

                                     HAMISH
                         You'll move

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will not.

               Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.

                                     FARMER STEWART
                         That's not fair!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         He's tired, he should get a longer 
                         run.

               William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a 
               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.

               Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and 
               heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's 
               head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. 
               William never flinches. The people cheer.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Brave show!

               Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.

                                     HAMISH
                         I threw longer than last time!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         An ox is strong, but not clever.

                                     HAMISH
                         An ox is stupid enough to just stand 
                         in one place.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's not the point.

               William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and 
               turns and hurls the rock he holds! It whistles through the 
               air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That is.

               Everybody cheers and laughs! They surround William.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         A fine display, young Wallace!

               William takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and 
               tosses the cold liquid into Hamish's face; he wakes, and, 
               his eyes uncrossing, accepts William's hand, pulling him up.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good to see you again.

                                     HAMISH
                         I should'a remembered the eggs.

               Grinning, they embrace. MUSIC plays, the dancing begins.

               William walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes 
               Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Would you honor me with a dance?

               She's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance.

                                     GIRL
                         You've taken over your father's farm?
                              (beat)
                         They say he died long ago. Fighting 
                         the English.

                                     WILLIAM
                         He died in an accident, with my 
                         brother. Their cart turned over.

               The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily 
               armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, 
               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In 
               the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, 
               in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.

                                     NOBLEMAN
                         I have come to claim the right of 
                         prima noctes. As the lord of these 
                         lands, I will bless this marriage by 
                         taking the bride into my bed on the 
                         first night of her union.

               Stewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward.

                                     STEWART
                         No, by God!

               The horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who 
               see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to 
               the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance.

                                     NOBLEMAN
                         It is my noble right.

               Even unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride 
               intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She 
               moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, 
               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. 
               Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's 
               courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more 
               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a 
               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is 
               leering at her. William Wallace sees this too.

               The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins 
               to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the 
               food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, 
               standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.

               EXT. THE WALLACE FARMHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

               The farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. William stands at 
               the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, 
               through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice.

               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

               A thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain.

               A hand KNOCKS on the door, and MacClannough opens it to find 
               William, on a horse! MacClannough frowns.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good evening, sir. May I speak with 
                         your daughter?

               Mrs. MacClannough shoulders up beside her husband, and Marion 
               appears behind her scowling parents.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Marion... Would you like to go for a 
                         ride on this fine evening?

                                     MOTHER
                         The boy's insane!

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's good Scottish weather, Madam, 
                         the rain is fallin' straight down.

                                     MOTHER
                         She absolutely may not, she'll -- 
                         Marion!

               Marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she 
               runs out to hop up behind William, and they gallop away.

               THE RIDE - MAGIC HOUR

               William and Marion race along the heather, up and down hills, 
               through swollen streams. The rain stops, as the sun sets; 
               the Scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty.

               William stops the horse and they look out over it all 
               together. He speaks, without turning to face her.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Your father doesn't like me, does 
                         he?

                                     MARION
                         It's not you. He dislikes that you're 
                         a Wallace. He just says... the 
                         Wallaces don't seem to live for very 
                         long.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Thank you for accepting.

                                     MARION
                         Thank you for inviting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll invite you again, but your mother 
                         thinks I'm crazy.

                                     MARION
                         You are. And I'll come again.

               He lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just 
               doesn't want the moment to end. Finally he spurs the horse.

               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT

               They reach the door. William hops off the horse and reaches 
               up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they 
               look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open 
               so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss.

                                     MOTHER
                         Marion, come in!

               He walks her closer to the door. They turn and look at each 
               other again. She waits for him to kiss her...

                                     MOTHER
                         Marion, come in!

               She still hesitates; he isn't going to kiss her. She starts 
               in, but he grabs her hand. And into it he puts something he 
               has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. He hops 
               on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away.

               She stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he 
               left her. She unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, 
               the one she gave him years before.

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               William is re-thatching the roof of his barn, when he hears 
               riders approaching, and looks down to see that it is 
               MacClannough, backed by Campbell and Hamish. Uh-oh.

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         Young Wallace --

                                     WILLIAM
                         Sir, I know it was strange of me to 
                         invite Marion to ride last night. I 
                         assure you, I --

                                     CAMPBELL
                         MacClannough's daughter is another 
                         matter. We come to fetch you to a 
                         meeting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         What kind of meeting?

                                     CAMPBELL
                         The secret kind.

               William goes back to repairing his roof.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Your father was a fighter. And a 
                         patriot.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I know who my father was. I came 
                         back home to raise crops. And, God 
                         willing, a family. If I can live in 
                         peace, I will.

               Campbell shakes his head and reins his horse away, with 
               Hamish. MacClannough lingers.

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         If you can keep your intention to 
                         stay out of the troubles, you may 
                         court my daughter. If you break your 
                         intention, I'll kill you.

               MacClannough rides away. William sits down on the roof, and 
               looks out at the graves of his father and brother.

               EXT. MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT

               Outside the half-timbered house, William stands in the shadows 
               of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper 
               window. Marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the 
               vines, dropping into William's arms.

               Giggling, suppressing laughter, they run to the trees...

               SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - NIGHT

               Hand in hand through the heather they run, silhouettes along 
               a ridge, their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight, 
               the Scottish wind whipping through their hair.

               They stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice, overlooking 
               a loch gleaming in the moonlight. So beautiful it's sacred.

                                     MARION
                         You've been here before?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly 
                         dreams I don't want. I started riding 
                         at night to fill up my mind so that 
                         when I did sleep I'd dream only of 
                         the ride and the adventure.

                                     MARION
                         Did it work?

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. You don't choose your dreams. 
                         Your dreams choose you.

               He looks at her. They kiss suddenly, so long and hard that 
               they tumble into the heather, rolling, devouring each other.

               Through their passion...

                                     WILLIAM
                         I want... to marry you!

                                     MARION
                         I... accept your proposal!

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'm not just saying it!

                                     MARION
                         Nor I!

                                     WILLIAM
                         But I won't give you up to any 
                         nobleman.

                                     MARION
                              (stopping)
                         You scare me.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't want to scare you. I want to 
                         be yours, and you mine. Every night 
                         like this one.

                                     MARION
                         This night is too beautiful to have 
                         again.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will be with you, like this. 
                         Forever.

               They kiss again...

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY

               Marion moves through the market. English soldiers admire her 
               as she walks. She stops, looking at white lace and cloth.

               William casually passes, poking a note in her basket. Subtly 
               she withdraws his note, and reads:

               INSERT - HIS NOTE

               Tonight. By the trees.

               EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Marion slips out of the house and runs to the trees, where 
               William waits with horses. She fetches a bundle she's stashed 
               in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off.

               EXT. RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CHURCH - NIGHT

               The church is at the base of the precipice, beside the loch.

               INT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT

               This ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by 
               the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, 
               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The 
               village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is 
               waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as 
               William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer.

               Marion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she 
               made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches 
               her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this 
               moment.

               Together, the two lovers turn to the priest.

                                     PRIEST
                         You have come to pledge, each to the 
                         other, before Almighty God.

               From within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth 
               woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand 
               to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will love you my whole life. You 
                         and no other.

               From her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered 
               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those 
               years ago.

                                     MARION
                         And I you. You and no other. Forever.

               The Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're 
               too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest 
               intones holy phrases...

                                     PRIEST
                         Agus bhayd lauch... The Lord bless 
                         and keep thy love, now and forever.

               The lovers kiss. As they break their embrace, a figure 
               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door 
               of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the 
               Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.

                                     PRIEST
                         I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him 
                         me'self. A weddin' needs pipes.

               The piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive 
               chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into 
               each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges 
               into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE

               William and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, 
               where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their 
               honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their 
               love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn.

               She waves from her window, as William rides away, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VILLAGE OF LANARK - DAY

               It's Market Day in the village, busy with Highlanders, 
               merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like 
               jugglers and fortune tellers. Marion moves along a table 
               full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging 
               baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his 
               beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks 
               up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she 
               remembers to conceal it. He moves up beside her.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I've missed you.

                                     MARION
                         Shush. It's only been a day.
                              (beat)
                         And it's seemed like forever.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Tonight then.

                                     MARION
                         My parents are growing suspicious! I 
                         can't keep meeting you every night!

               Playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, 
               pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their 
               wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Then when?

                                     MARION
                         ...Tonight!

               Tucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling.

               ANGLE - DRUNKEN ENGLISH SOLDIERS - BY AN ALE CASK - DAY

               They spot Marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful.

               The soldiers smirk at each other; as Marion passes, one of 
               them grabs her wrist. It's the soldier with the scar, the 
               one who's been staring at her.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Where are you going... lass?

                                     MARION
                         Let go.

               A second drunken SOLDIER pipes up.

                                     SOLDIER #2
                         Why don't you marry my friend here? 
                         Then I'll take the first night!

               The scarred soldier pulls Marion into his big arms; she shoves 
               him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to 
               the laughter of his friends. Then he snatches her again and 
               kisses her hard on the lips.

               She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw 
               blood from his mouth. Tasting the trickle, he slings her 
               down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over 
               her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale 
               public gang rape. As the townspeople try to move in the three 
               soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, 
               keep them townspeople back.

                                     SOLDIER #1
                         Bitch, who do you think you are?

               He slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, 
               comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and 
               is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed!

               It takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what 
               just happened, and in that instant William is on them. He 
               wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant 
               to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and 
               slinging the howling soldier into his comrades.

               Two of the soldiers leap at William, swinging their short 
               swords; William ducks, knocking their ale cask into their 
               knees; William lifts the whole table where they were sitting 
               and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.

                                     MARION
                         William!

               She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now 
               bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William 
               with a knife. William sidesteps the first thrust, snatches a 
               leg from the shattered table and crushes the man's skull.

                                     MARKET WOMEN
                         Wallace Wallace! William Wallace!

               But there's no time for celebration. There's blood and ale 
               everywhere, and the fallen soldiers are yelling...

                                     FALLEN SOLDIER
                         Rebels! Help!

               MORE SOLDIERS hear the call and come running, reinforcements 
               converging from all over the village.

                                     VILLAGE FOLKS
                         Run, William! Run!

               Will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws 
               Marion up onto its back. He slaps the horse's rump and it 
               plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes. William 
               darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of 
               his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!

               William pauses out in the central street of the village, 
               just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts 
               into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; 
               William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval 
               town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts.

               As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down 
               at his mangled soldiers. The one with the ruptured arm is 
               lying in agony.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         What happened?

                                     SOLDIER
                         ...girl.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         What girl?!

                                     SOLDIER
                         ...on horse.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         The girl on the horse! Stop her!

               The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and 
               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's 
               trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even 
               narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom...

               But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there 
               behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden 
               thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall.

               Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught 
               on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward 
               again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching 
               and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.

               WILLIAM

               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the 
               river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've 
               lost him. Thinking Marion's made it too, William heads deeper 
               into the trees.

               IN THE TOWN, MARION

               recovers; her dress has torn free! She starts to get up; but 
               the soldiers' pikes appear over her, and the magistrate leers.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         So this is the little whore he was 
                         fighting for.

               EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY

               William moves into the shelters of the trees, expecting to 
               see Marion. He doesn't. He listens; only the rustling of the 
               wind through the treetops.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Marion!

               Nothing, except the wind.

               INT. ROYAL MAGISTRATE'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an 
               oak staff behind her elbows. She and two dozen soldiers are 
               in the tavern the English have commandeered.

               The Magistrate is a battlescarred veteran, a brutal pragmatist 
               angry with his CORPORAL.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         One Scot buggers six of us? Hell to 
                         pay when that gets round.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Burn the village.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         But he is free. You never catch 'em 
                         in the Highlands.

               He studies Marion, her mouth now stuffed with burlap. He 
               notices the strip of cloth around her neck, and touches the 
               weave curiously.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Clans weave that cloth in their own 
                         patterns.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         So why is this strip concealed?
                              (beat)
                         He fought for you, eh?

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               The Magistrate and his men bring Marion into the village 
               center, and tie her to a post of the well. The townspeople 
               don't want to be near the soldiers, but they hang on the 
               fringes of the square, too curious to pull away.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         An assault on the king's soldiers is 
                         the same as assaulting the king!

               He looks down at Marion, her mouth bound, her eyes defiant.

               He jerks out his dagger and slices Marion's throat!

               Her eyes spring open like a doe's; then she sags, dead. The 
               townspeople are speechless; even some of the soldiers are 
               shocked. The Magistrate turns calmly to his men.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Now. Let this scrapper come to me.

               LONG SHOT - EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY

               From a distance, we see Hamish approaching the grove, the 
               same one where he and William played as boys. Hamish moves 
               reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, 
               William appears, hurrying out to him.

               We STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously 
               for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells 
               him something that makes William step backwards...

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY

               At a barrier across the main road into the center of the 
               village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully 
               armed -- bows, pikes, swords. They hear A HORSE'S SNORT...

               THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE

               He has stopped, rock still. The soldiers hush; there is 
               something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the 
               twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery.

               Wallace raises his sword, screams... and charges!

               EXT. VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT

               We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse 
               pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their 
               eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their 
               bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...

               The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch 
               his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as 
               Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's 
               more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly 
               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the 
               corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!

               The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his 
               horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's 
               back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a 
               wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder 
               but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two 
               men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.

               WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV

               He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, 
               barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; 
               the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next 
               chops down on his left side; every time he swings the 
               broadsword, a man dies.

               Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from 
               the village, follow in his wake.

               EXT. IN THE VILLAGE - DAY

               The Magistrate hears the APPROACHING SHOUTS. He and thirty 
               more of his men are barricaded around the village square.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Don't look surprised! We knew he'd 
                         bring friends!

               The see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads 
               down a side street.

               The Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go?

               Which way will he come from? And then they hear the horses, 
               and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The 
               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them.

               They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on 
               foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge!

               The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.

               The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues.

               Not far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters.

               He turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         No! I beg you... mercy!

               IN THE TOWN SQUARE

               As the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English 
               soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his 
               hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams 
               him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs 
               and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Please. Mercy!

               Wallace's eyes shift, falling on

               THE STAIN OF BLOOD

               Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, 
               the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street. Wallace 
               spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat 
               with the sword.

               ON THE OTHER SCOTS

               Silenced by what they've just seen and done. On old Campbell's 
               face is a look of reverence, and awe.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Say Grace to God, lads. We've just 
                         seen the coming of the Messiah.

               William staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees.

               And then not just the Scottish farmers but the townspeople 
               too begin a strange, Hi-Lo chant.

                                     CROWD
                         AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! AHHHHHH-UHHHHHH!

               William's wild eyes slowly regain their focus. And there in 
               the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he 
               gave to Marion, now stained with her blood. He lifts it, 
               crushes it in his hand, as the Highlanders chant for war.

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The villagers are still excited by what just happened; at 
               the blacksmith's forge, men tend to Campbell's wound...

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Pour it straight into the wound. I 
                         know it seems a waste of good whiskey, 
                         but indulge me.

               They obey, then take a glowing poker from the fire and run 
               it through Campbell's shoulder, where the arrow went. There 
               is a terrible SIZZLE, and Campbell reacts to the pain.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses, 
                         lads.

               Campbell looks down at his left hand. His thumb is missing!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now 
                         it's nothing but a fly swatter.

               Wallace is sitting alone nearby, staring at nothing. Hamish 
               moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder. Wallace looks at 
               his friend, and looks away; killing the Magistrate did not 
               bring Marion back.

               SHOUTS of alarm: ARMED MEN are coming! The farmers scramble 
               for their weapons, ready to fight; even Campbell jumps up; 
               but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more 
               farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could 
               find for weapons. Their leader is MacGREGOR.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         MacGregor -- from the next valley!

               MacGregor leads his men into the circle of rebels.

                                     MACGREGOR
                         We heard about what was happenin'. 
                         And we don't want ya thinkin' ya can 
                         have your fun without us.

                                     WALLACE
                         Go home. Some of us are in this, I 
                         can't help that now. But you can 
                         help yourselves. Go home.

                                     MACGREGOR
                         We'll have no homes left when the 
                         English garrison at the castle comes 
                         through to burn us out.

               They all look at Wallace.

               EXT. ENGLISH MILITARY STRONGHOLD - NIGHT

               Furious preparations: armorers pound breastplates, hone 
               spears, grind swords in a shower of sparks. The garrison is 
               led by BOTTOMS, the English lord who claimed the right of 
               prima noctes. Now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers.

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Gather the horses! Align the infantry!
                              (grabs a man)
                         Ride to the Lord Governor in Stirling.

               Tell him that I will hang five rebels for every good 
               Englishman killed! FORM FOR MARCH!

               The troops begin to scramble into the courtyard. At the same 
               time, the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the 
               keepers to open it. They pull up the chains and the heavy 
               gate rises. The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- 
               and is hit in the chest with an axe!

               The Scots, hidden just outside the gate, come pouring through, 
               led by Wallace! Arrows pick soldiers from their perches, 
               Scots drop over the wall; the surprise is so complete that 
               it's over almost without a fight. Lord Bottoms looks around 
               in confusion...

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Stop them... Don't let... Align...

               Scots drag Lord Bottoms off his horse; an arrow in a flexed 
               bow jabs right up to his eye, the archer ready to drive the 
               shaft through Bottom's eye socket and into his brain; but 
               Wallace's hand closes on the archer's fingers -- and Bottoms 
               sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is 
               none other than the Highland farmgirl he forced into his bed 
               on her wedding night. Beside her is her husband, holding a 
               scythe, red with English blood.

                                     WALLACE
                         On your way somewhere, M'lord?

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Murdering bloody bandit!

               The point of Wallace's sword jumps beneath the Lord's chin.

                                     WALLACE
                         My name is William Wallace. I am no 
                         bandit who hides his face... Find 
                         this man a horse.

               The green eyes of the defiled highland bride flash fire.

               William takes his hand from her bow and looks at her, grief 
               for Marion in his eyes; for the sake of that she does not 
               release the string.

                                     WALLACE
                         Give him a horse.

               Hamish extends the reins of the Lord's thoroughbred.

                                     WALLACE
                         Not this horse. That one.

               He nods to a bony nag hitched next to a glue pot.

                                     WALLACE
                         Today we will spare you, and every 
                         man who has yielded. Go back to 
                         England. Tell them Scotland's 
                         daughters and her sons are yours no 
                         more. Tell them Scotland is free.

               As the Scots cheer, Wallace throws Lord Bottoms onto the 
               nag's back and slaps the horse's rear. IT shambles away, 
               followed by the English survivors, as the Scots chant...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace, Wal-lace!...

               CLOSE - A GRAVESTONE - EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY

               The marker is carved with the name MARION MacCLANNOUGH, and 
               beneath her name A THISTLE is chiseled into the stone.

               Bagpipes wail like banshees and the Priest who married Marion 
               and William now mutters ancient prayers as her body, wrapped 
               in burial canvas, is lowered into the earth, under the sad 
               eyes of those who just fought in the battle.

               Opposite William stands old MacClannough; he stares across 
               the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his 
               eyes full of pain, and then staggers away.

               Wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. From 
               within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief 
               she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave 
               her. He places the strip over her heart, and as the 
               gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to 
               its spot over his own heart.

               EXT. LONDON PALACE - DAY

               Prince Edward is in his garden, playing the medieval version 
               of croquet with his friend. The Princess, ignored, sits 
               watching. Longshanks marches through the game, furious.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Scottish rebels have routed Lord 
                         Bottoms!

                                     EDWARD
                         I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, 
                         nothing more.

               Longshanks slaps his son, knocking him down among the colored 
               balls and wickets. Everyone gasps, stunned.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You weak little coward! Stand up!

               Longshanks jerks him to his feet.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         I go to France to press our rights 
                         there! I leave you to handle this 
                         little rebellion, do you understand? 
                         DO YOU?!

               Longshanks grabs his son by the throat.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         And turn yourself into a man.

               The king leaves. The friends of the humiliated Prince hurry 
               to him and lift him; as the Princess moves to him too...

                                     EDWARD
                         Get away from me!

               He slaps her! Her personal guards, Frenchmen in distinctive 
               uniforms, jump from their seats at the edge of the garden, 
               but the Princess raises a hand to show she needs no 
               assistance, and curtseys to Edward, who shouts --

                                     EDWARD
                         Convene my military council!

               As Edward marches off with his entourage, NICOLETTE, a 
               beautiful raven-haired Handmaiden, rushes to the Princess, 
               who is wobbly, hurt more than she let show. Nicolette whispers 
               to her in French, with subtitles...

                                     NICOLETTE
                         They say this Wallace killed thirty 
                         men to avenge the death of his woman. 
                         I hope your husband goes to Scotland. 
                         Then you'll be a widow.

               INT. BRUCE'S CASTLE - BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               Robert the Bruce is in bed with a young Nordic beauty with 
               vacant blue eyes. She drowses; but the lovemaking has not 
               defused the restlessness of Robert's spirit. He lies on his 
               stomach, turned away from her on the bed. Stirring, she kisses 
               his neck; but he doesn't respond.

                                     WOMAN
                         I wanted to please you.

                                     ROBERT
                         You did.

               But he is numb as she nuzzles him again. She sags back, and 
               he still stares away, lost in thought. Realizing her hurt, 
               he explains...

                                     ROBERT
                         In Lanark village, the king's soldiers 
                         killed a girl. Her lover fought his 
                         way through the soldiers and killed 
                         the magistrate.

               She looks at him blankly.

                                     ROBERT
                         He rebelled. He rebelled. He acted. 
                         He fought! Was it rage? Pride? Love? 
                         Whatever it was, he has more of it 
                         than I.

                                     WOMAN
                              (hurt)
                         You might have lied.

                                     ROBERT
                         I'm too arrogant to lie.

               CLOSE - ROBERT THE BRUCE

               On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.

               He follows a servant who carries a candle against the gloom.

               They reach a door, which the servant unlocks. Young Robert 
               takes the candle, and enters --

               A DARKENED ROOM

               Robert wills himself forward, and places the candle on a 
               table in the center of the room. A SHUFFLE in the dark; then 
               moving into the light is a LEPER whose once-noble features 
               are decaying with the disease. Isolated in his disfiguration, 
               he looks at his visitor -- his son -- with the eyes of the 
               condemned. Young Robert forces himself not to look away.

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         Father. A rebellion has begun.

                                     THE LEPER
                         Under whom?

                                     ROBERT
                         A commoner named William Wallace.

                                     THE LEPER
                         A commoner? So no one leads Scotland?

               The old man thinks, and points a half finger at his son.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You will embrace this rebellion. 
                         Support it, from our lands in the 
                         north. I will gain English favor by 
                         condemning it and ordering it opposed 
                         from our lands in the south. Whichever 
                         way the tide runs, we will rise.

                                     ROBERT
                         This Wallace. He doesn't even have a 
                         knighthood. But he fights with 
                         passion, and he is clever. He inspires 
                         men.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You admire him. Uncompromising men 
                         are easy to admire. He has courage. 
                         So does a dog. But you must understand 
                         this: Edward Longshanks is the most 
                         ruthless king ever to sit on the 
                         throne of England, and none of us, 
                         and nothing of Scotland, will survive 
                         unless we are as ruthless, more 
                         ruthless, than he.

               Young Bruce rises heavily, and moves to the door.

                                     THE LEPER
                         Press your case to the nobles. They 
                         will choose who rules Scotland.

               With a last long look at his father, Robert leaves.

               EXT. SCOTLAND - MONTAGE - DAY

               -- Troops ride through the countryside, intimidating and 
               questioning civilians; all refuse to talk.

               -- Wallace's house burns, as soldiers dig up the graves of 
               his father and brother, and scatter their bones to dogs.

               -- The English search through the woods, finding nothing.

               EXT. WALLACE LANDS - NIGHT

               William and Hamish ride, to see the damage. They find the 
               smoking ruins, and the defiled family graves.

                                     HAMISH
                         Ah, William... I am so sorry.

               William is struck by an awful, urgent thought...

               EXT. UNDERBRUSH NEAR MARION'S GRAVE - DUSK

               We open on Marion's grave, with the thistle-carved marker, 
               looking peaceful; but up the hill in the underbrush, English 
               soldiers wait in ambush. Edgy, they perk up at the sound of 
               muffled hoofbeats -- then their eyes bug as a cloaked figure -- 
               Wallace -- suddenly looms up behind them, galloping and 
               swirling fire! He hurls burning torches into the clustered 
               soldiers, setting some of them on fire!

               MEANWHILE, HAMISH has crawled to Marion's grave and is digging 
               frantically. The new dirt parts easily and he pulls the 
               shrouded body out, cringing with the effort.

               MORE SOLDIERS rush from behind the rocks at the far side of 
               the graveyard. Wallace charges them, driving them back. He 
               grabs the reins of Hamish's horse, hidden among trees, and 
               gallops to him.

               Hamish hands the shrouded body up to William and bounds into 
               the saddle of his own horse. They spur the horses and ride 
               away, William clutching Marion's shrouded body to his chest.

               EXT. SECRET GROVE ON THE PRECIPICE - NIGHT

               William dismounts, stretching the body gently on the ground.

               Hamish dismounts too, with the spade he used to dig up the 
               old grave. He sees the emotion on William's face.

                                     HAMISH
                         I'll wait... back there.

                                     WALLACE
                         Hamish, I... thank...

               Hamish puts a hand on his friend's shoulder, then quietly 
               leads the horses away. William starts to dig...

               LATER IN THE GROVE

               William sits looking at the new grave, covered with leaves -- 
               completely hidden. He touches his hand to the earth.

               EXT. WOODS - BY THE STREAM - NIGHT

               Hamish is waiting as William comes out of the grove. There 
               is nothing to say. They mount their horses and ride away, as 
               the MUSIC of William and Marion's love haunts us...

               EXT. WOODS - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Wallace and his inner circle hare huddled around a small 
               fire. Other highlanders guard the perimeters. Old Campbell 
               is lovingly honing the broadswords to razor edges and sharing 
               a whiskey jug with Hamish, who stares at the fire. Wallace 
               is using a stick to draw diagrams in the dirt.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         What're ya doin'?

                                     WALLACE
                         Thinking.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Does it hurt?

                                     WALLACE
                         What do we do when Longshanks sends 
                         his whole northern army against us? 
                         They have heavy cavalry. Armored 
                         horses, that shake the very ground. 
                         They'll ride right over us.

               At a loss, Wallace looks up at the sky. HE SEES: the trees 
               stretching into the night like spikes to skewer the stars.

                                     WALLACE
                         We make spears. A hundred spears. 
                         Fourteen feet long.

                                     HAMISH
                         Fourteen? --

                                     SENTRY (O.S.)
                         Volunteers coming in!

               They look to see a half dozen new volunteers being led in, 
               blindfolded. When the guides remove the blindfolds, the new 
               recruits see Wallace and rush to him, bowing.

                                     RECRUIT (FAUDRON)
                         William Wallace? We have come to 
                         fight and die for you!

                                     WALLACE
                         Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope.

                                     FAUDRON
                         I am Faudron! My sword is yours! And 
                         I brought you this tarta --

               As he reaches into his cloak, both Hamish and Campbell 
               instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck.

                                     SENTRY
                         We checked them for arms.

               Carefully, Faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf, and 
               replaces Wallace's tattered old one.

                                     FAUDRON
                         It's your family tartan! My wife 
                         wove it with her own hands.

                                     WALLACE
                         Thank her for me.

               A loud voice interrupts...

                                     VOICE
                         Him? That can't be William Wallace! 
                         I'm prettier than this man!

               They all look at a slender, handsome young man, STEPHEN, who 
               is talking to himself -- or more accurately, seems to listen 
               to some unheard voice, then answer it...

                                     STEPHEN
                         All right, Father, I'll ask him!
                              (to William)
                         If I risk my neck for you, will I 
                         get a chance to kill Englishmen?

                                     HAMISH
                         Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you 
                         converse with God Almighty?

                                     STEPHEN
                         In order to find his equal, and 
                         Irishman is forced to talk to God.
                              (quickly)
                         Yes, Father!...
                              (to Wallace)
                         The Almighty says don't change the 
                         subject, just answer the fookin' 
                         question.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Insane Irish --

               Stephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at 
               Campbell's throat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Smart enough to get a dagger past 
                         your guards, old man.

               Wallace jerks his sword to the Irishman's throat, and grins.

                                     WALLACE
                         That's my friend, Irishman. And the 
                         answer's yes. You fight for me, you 
                         kill the English.

               Stephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm 
                         the most wanted man on the Emerald 
                         Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald 
                         Isle of course, more's the pity.

                                     HAMISH
                         A common thief.

                                     STEPHEN
                         A patriot!

               Wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the 
               sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces.

               EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               A column of English light cavalry -- a hundred riders -- 
               moves through the picturesque beauty of the Highlands.

               English LORD DOLECROFT is in command, wearing a hat with a 
               pompous white plume. UP AHEAD, the English SCOUT sees five 
               Scots, including Hamish, walking out of the forest. The Scots 
               run; the Scout rides back to Dolecroft.

                                     SCOUT
                         Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west!

                                     DOLECROFT
                         They've blundered at last! After 
                         them!

               The English force charges off. Hamish and his men changed 
               direction but the English spot them crossing a hilltop and 
               ride after them. The Scots run for their lives; the English 
               horses gallop. The Scots run down one slope, up another; the 
               English follow, find their horses stumbling, and see...

                                     SCOUT
                         We're in a bog!

                                     DOLECROFT
                         Here, it's firm this way --

               But as they move toward the firm ground, fifty Scots appear 
               on the crest of the hill. Hamish leads them, smiling.

               Dolecroft wheels and looks to his rear; Wallace appears there, 
               with fifty more, and more Scots appear to the left and right 
               of the English, who are surrounded in the bog. Too late, 
               Dolecroft realizes his blunder. Wallace lifts his broadsword, 
               screams, and leads the charge...

               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - DAY

               The Scots are moving through deep woods; they are laden with 
               the booty they took from the English cavalry: extra weapons, 
               clothing, food -- and one man even wears the late Dolecroft's 
               plumed hat. Wallace is leading them, traveling with his heavy 
               sheathed broadsword across his shoulders.

                                     WALLACE
                         Stop here and rest.

               They collapse to the leaves and loam, greedily squeezing 
               water from sheep belly canteens.

               INT. STIRLING CASTLE - DAY

               LORD PICKERING, English commander, is handed news of the 
               disaster. He reads the message, and pales.

                                     PICKERING
                         Another ambush! My God! ...What about 
                         our infiltrator?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         He has already joined them, M'lord.

               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - NIGHT

               The moon is high above the Scots, encamped for the night.

               Most everyone is sleeping, but William sits leaning against 
               a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. Suddenly William freezes; a 
               shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty 
               feet ahead of him. Something about her is familiar -- and 
               then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, 
               cascading in the moonlight... It is Marion!

                                     WALLACE
                         Marion! Is... is it you?

               Joy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before 
               he touches her, as if she might evaporate.

                                     WALLACE
                         I'm dreaming.

                                     MARION
                         Yes, you are. And you must wake.

                                     WALLACE
                         I don't want to wake. I want to stay 
                         with you.

                                     MARION
                         And I with you. But you must wake.

                                     WALLACE
                         I need you so much! I love you!

                                     MARION
                         Wake up, William. Wake up!

                                     HAMISH'S VOICE
                         Wake up, William!...

                                     MARION/HAMISH
                         Wake up!...

               William clutches at Marion, but his arms can't enclose her.

               HE WAKES

               lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, 
               William's arms clutched empty to his chest.

                                     HAMISH
                         William! Hounds!

               Wallace jumps up, hearing the DISTANT BARKING that alarmed 
               Hamish. Stephen, the new Irish recruit, races up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We must run in different directions!

                                     HAMISH
                         We don't split up!

                                     STEPHEN
                         They used hounds on us in Ireland, 
                         it's the only way!

                                     WALLACE
                         He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide 
                         them and run!

               Shoving groups of men in different directions, Wallace then 
               takes off. His group is about a dozen; they race through the 
               woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. They stop and listen. 
               The BARKS are getting closer.

                                     WALLACE
                         Split again!

               Again they divide, and race in different directions.

               But no matter how they run and dodge, the BARKS grow nearer.

               We INTERCUT with the approaching of the dogs -- a large PACK 
               OF HOUNDS, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the 
               dogs, Lord Pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long 
               chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches.

               Wallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a 
               new direction. The hounds are relentless. Wallace's group is 
               down to Hamish, Stephen, and Faudron.

                                     WALLACE
                         No matter how we go, they follow. 
                         They have our scent. My scent.

                                     FAUDRON
                         Run! You must not be caught!

               Faster now, faster. The barks are getting very close.

               Wallace and his friends are starting to panic. The blood 
               beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. And we 
               MOVE IN on Wallace's eyes. He stops, gasping.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We can't stop!

                                     WALLACE
                         They've tricked us.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What's the crazy man saying, Lord?

                                     WALLACE
                         The dogs have a scent. My scent. 
                         Someone must have given it to them.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Who would do such a thing?

                                     WALLACE
                         Exactly.

               Wallace pulls out his dagger...

               THE DOGS

               bark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at 
               their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along.

                                     HANDLER
                         Be ready! We have them!

               The soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their 
               prisoners. They burst into the little clearing; the dogs 
               find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their 
               snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. The handlers must fight 
               furiously to tear the dogs from the body.

               Lord Pickering approaches the body and looks down. It is 
               Faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable -- with the 
               scarf he gave William, in place of William's own, tucked 
               into his shirt.

                                     LORD PICKERING
                         Damnation! Damnation!

               As Pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around.

                                     LORD PICKERING
                         After him! Get them going again!

                                     HANDLER
                         Their noses are drowned in new blood, 
                         they'll follow nothing now!

               And just as the realization hits Pickering that he can't 
               pursue Wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among 
               his men leans in from behind him to whisper...

                                     STEPHEN OF IRELAND
                         The Almighty says for you to give 
                         His regards to the Devil.

               Pickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as Stephen's dagger 
               slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. As 
               Pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, Stephen 
               has already run back into the trees.

               Pickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. Even 
               the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around 
               them. Then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus 
               of demonic, bloodcurdling yells --

                                     WALLACE/HAMISH/STEPHEN
                         ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!

               Three wild men tear out of the darkness from different 
               directions, their swords slashing. Pickering's men panic and 
               run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by 
               their torches, fell with them in all directions.

               Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are left alone in the heart of 
               the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves -- 
               and then laughing like hyenas!

                                     STEPHEN
                         I thought I was dead when ya pulled 
                         that dagger!

                                     WALLACE
                         No English lord would trust an 
                         Irishman!

                                     HAMISH
                         Let's kill him anyway.

               They laugh again; then Wallace's laughter leaks away, and he 
               stares into the trees, where he saw Marion in his dream.

               VARIOUS SHOTS - THE STORY SPREADS THROUGH SCOTLAND...

               Two men are talking in A VILLAGE...

                                     VILLAGER
                         ...and William Wallace killed fifty 
                         men! Fifty, if it was one!

               The same tale is exchanged by two farmers AT A CROSSROADS...

                                     FARMER
                         A hundred men! With his own sword! 
                         He cut a through the English like --

               The tale is repeated IN A TAVERN...

                                     DRINKER
                         -- Moses through the Red Sea! Hacked 
                         off two hundred heads!

                                     DRINKER #2
                         Two hundred?!

                                     DRINKER
                         Saw it with my own eyes.

               And the rumors are discussed even INSIDE THE PALACE GROUNDS 
               IN LONDON, where the Prince and his friends are trying on 
               elaborate attire presented them by fawning tailors, and the 
               Princess, ignored by her husband, strolls and chats with her 
               Handmaiden, Nicolette (in subtitled French).

                                     NICOLETTE
                         When the king returns he will bury 
                         them in those new clothes. Scotland 
                         is in chaos. Your husband is secretly 
                         sending an army north.

                                     PRINCESS
                         How do you know this?

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Last night I slept with a member of 
                         the War Council.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He shouldn't be telling secrets in 
                         bed.

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what 
                         a tongue is for.

               The Princess blushes, whacks her with her fan, and smiles.

                                     PRINCESS
                         This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He 
                         fights to avenge a woman?

                                     NICOLETTE
                         A magistrate wished to capture him, 
                         and found he had a secret lover, so 
                         he cut the girl's throat to tempt 
                         Wallace to fight -- and fight he 
                         did.

               The Princess is pained at such cruelty; Nicolette warms to 
               share the juicy gossip...

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Knowing his passion for his lost 
                         love, they next plotted to take him 
                         by desecrating the graves of his 
                         father and brother and setting an 
                         ambush at the grave of his wife. He 
                         fought his way through the trap and 
                         carried her body to a secret place! 
                         Now that is romance, Oui?

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...I wouldn't know.

               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

               A Highlander, a RUNNER, slips like a shadow up the hillside, 
               to a circle of ancient monoliths. There, hidden among the 
               stone pillars, he finds Wallace and his band resting.

                                     RUNNER
                         The English are advancing an army 
                         toward Stirling!

                                     WALLACE
                         Do the nobles rally?

                                     RUNNER
                         Robert the Bruce and most of the 
                         others will not commit to war! But 
                         word has spread and Highlanders are 
                         coming down on their own, by the 
                         hundreds -- by the thousands!

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Wallace rides down the road, followed by his band. As they 
               pass people on the road, the women, the children, all cheer.

                                     PEOPLE
                         Wallace! It's William Wallace! God 
                         bless Wallace and Scotland!

               At a crossroads, more of Wallace's men join them, in clusters. 
               One group carries something long, encased in wool covers. 
               Farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave 
               their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after 
               the riders. They put on their forbidden tartans, kiss their 
               wives and head off to fight.

               EXT. STIRLING FIELD - DAY

               Stirling Castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, 
               cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge.

               SCOTTISH NOBLES have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking 
               the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and 
               banners, and are attended by squires and grooms.

               The mists of morning shroud most of the field. But from the 
               opposite side of the bridge they hear the CLATTERING of a 
               huge army moving forward. LOCHLAN, a noble, gallops to Mornay.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         It sounds like twenty thousand!

                                     MORNAY
                         The scouts say it is ten.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         And we have but two!

               THE COMMON SCOTTISH SOLDIERS

               are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and 
               daggers. As through the mists they see the numbers arrayed 
               against them, a YOUNG SOLDIER tugs at a grizzled VETERAN.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         So many!

                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
                         The nobles will negotiate. If they 
                         deal, they send us home. If not, we 
                         charge. When we are all dead and 
                         they can call themselves brave, they 
                         withdraw.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         I didn't come to fight so they could 
                         own more lands that I could work for 
                         them!

                                     VETERAN
                         Nor did I. Not against these odds!

               He lowers his pike and starts to desert. At first one-by-one 
               and then in clumps, more highlanders follow.

               THE NOBLES see the desertion.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         Stop! Men! Do not flee! Not now! 
                         Wait until we have negotiated!

                                     MORNAY
                         They won't stop -- and who could 
                         blame them?

               Then, riding into the mob of men, comes Wallace, followed by 
               his friends. He's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms 
               bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather 
               shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, 
               Wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it.

               The entire Scottish army watches in fascination as Wallace 
               and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. The 
               soldiers whisper among themselves...

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         William Wallace?

                                     VETERAN
                         Couldn't be.

               The common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up 
               the hill to see the confrontation. As Wallace and his captains 
               reach the nobles, Stephen laughs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The Almighty says this must be a 
                         fashionable fight, it's drawn the 
                         finest people.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         Where is thy salute?

                                     WALLACE
                         For presenting yourselves on this 
                         battlefield, I give you thanks.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         This is our army. To join it, you 
                         give homage.

                                     WALLACE
                         I give homage to Scotland. And if 
                         this is your army, why does it go?

               Wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen 
               men, now frightened, ready to desert. We play this picture, 
               Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing 
               that has grown beyond anyone's imagination.

               He glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen.

               They've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.

                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
                         We didn't come to fight for them!

                                     SHOUTS FROM MOB
                         Home! The English are too many!

               Wallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent.

                                     WALLACE
                         Sons of Scotland!... I am William 
                         Wallace!

                                     SOLDIER
                         William Wallace is seven feet tall!

                                     WALLACE
                         Yes, I have heard! He kills men by 
                         the hundreds! And if he were here, 
                         he would consume the English with 
                         fireballs from his eyes, and bolts 
                         of lightning from his ass!

               Many laugh -- all get the point.

                                     WALLACE
                         I am William Wallace. And my enemies 
                         do not go away. I saw our good nobles 
                         hanged. My wife... I am William 
                         Wallace. And I see a whole army of 
                         my countrymen, here in defiance of 
                         tyranny. You have come to fight as 
                         free men. And free men you are! What 
                         will you do with freedom? Will you 
                         fight?

                                     VETERAN
                         Two thousand, against ten? We will 
                         run -- and live!

                                     WALLACE
                         Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and 
                         you will live, at least awhile. And 
                         dying in your bed many years from 
                         now, would you be willing to trade 
                         all the days from this day to that, 
                         for one chance to come back here as 
                         young men, and tell our enemies that 
                         they make take our lives, but they 
                         will never take our freedom?

               Down on the plain, English emissaries in all their regal 
               finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce.

                                     VETERAN
                         Look! The English comes to barter 
                         with our nobles for castles and 
                         titles. And our nobles will not be 
                         in the front of the battle!

                                     WALLACE
                         No! They will not!

               He dismounts, and draws his sword.

                                     WALLACE
                         And I will.

               Slowly, the chant begins, and builds...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! WAL-LACE!

               BAGPIPERS play, pulling the mob back into companies. But 
               through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy 
               army. Hamish, Campbell and Stephen move up beside William.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fine speech. Now what do we do?

                                     WALLACE
                         Bring out our spearmen and set them 
                         in the field.

               Campbell, Hamish and Stephen ride off. Mornay reins his horse 
               over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them 
               to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks.

               Wallace mounts up and rides out with the Scottish nobles to 
               meet the English contingent.

               OUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS

               meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. 
               CHELTHAM, head of the English contingent, glares at Wallace.

                                     CHELTHAM
                         Mornay. Lochlan. Inverness.

                                     MORNAY
                         Cheltham. This is William Wallace

                                     CHELTHAM
                         Here are the King's terms. Lead this 
                         army off the field, and he will give 
                         you each estates in Yorkshire, 
                         including hereditary title, from 
                         which you will pay him an annual --

                                     WALLACE
                         I have an offer for you.

                                     CHELTHAM
                         ...From which you will pay the King 
                         an annual duty...

               Wallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at Cheltham, whose 
               eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         You disrespect a banner of truce?!

                                     WALLACE
                         From his king? Absolutely. Here are 
                         Scotland's terms. Lower your flags 
                         and march straight to England, 
                         stopping at every Scottish home you 
                         pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred 
                         years of theft, rape, and murder. Do 
                         that, and your men shall live. Do it 
                         not, and every one of you will die 
                         today.

               Cheltham barks at the Scottish nobles...

                                     CHELTHAM
                         You are outmatched! You haven't even 
                         any cavalry! In two centuries no 
                         army has won without it!

                                     WALLACE
                         I'm not finished. Before we let you 
                         leave, your commander must cross 
                         that bridge, stand before this army, 
                         put his head between his legs, and 
                         kiss his own ass.

               The outraged Englishman gallops back to his lines.

                                     MORNAY
                         I'd say that was rather less cordial 
                         that he was used to.

                                     WALLACE
                         Be ready, and do exactly as I say.

               They return to the Scottish lines. Wallace dismounts where 
               his men are breaking out new 14-foot spears. Hamish, eyebrows 
               raised, looks expectantly at Wallace; Wallace nods.

                                     HAMISH
                         Wish I could see the noble lord's 
                         face when he tells him.

               LORD TALMADGE, AT HIS COMMAND POST

               The husky English commander's blood boils from Cheltham's 
               report. Before he can respond, they see WALLACE'S SPEARMEN 
               taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. Suddenly 
               the Scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the English!

                                     TALMADGE
                         Insolent bastard! Full attack! Give 
                         no quarter! And I want this Wallace's 
                         heart brought to me on a plate!

               Cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack...

               EXT. THE FIELD BELOW STIRLING CASTLE - DAY

               The English army moves forward toward the bridge. It's so 
               narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it 
               at any one time. The English heavy cavalry, two hundred 
               knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side.

               WITH WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

               Things look terrible. Stephen turns to William.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The Lord tell me He can get me out 
                         of this mess. But He's pretty sure 
                         you're fooked.

               ON THE ENGLISH SIDE

               Talmadge sees the Scots doing nothing.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Amateurs! They do not even contest 
                         us! Send across the infantry.

                                     GENERAL
                         M'lord, the bridge is so narrow --

                                     TALMADGE
                         The Scots just stand in their 
                         formations!

               Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Get the infantry 
               across so they can finish the slaughter!

               The English leaders shout orders and keep their men moving 
               across the bridge. Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.

               THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

               The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to 
               attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower 
               the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they 
               look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in 
               scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!

               Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground 
               literally shakes with the charge.

               The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to 
               imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH 
               LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the 
               RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...

               Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.

                                     WALLACE
                         Steady! Hold... hold... NOW!

               The Scots snap their 14-foot spears straight up in unison.

                                     WALLACE
                         FORM!

               Now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first 
               line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above 
               the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five 
               foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet.

               The English knights have never seen such a formation. Their 
               lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum 
               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on 
               foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale 
               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.

               TALMADGE

               can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN 
               AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.

               WALLACE AND HIS MEN

               are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and 
               knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen 
               out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still 
               alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull 
               up their mounts. Wallace and his men are so much more mobile 
               than the knights; the field runs with blood.

               Wallace faces Talmadge in the distance.

                                     WALLACE
                         Here I am, English coward! Come get 
                         me!!

               TALMADGE is even more enraged -- and his judgment is gone.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Press the men across!

                                     CHELTHAM
                         But M'lord!

               Talmadge himself gallops forward.

                                     TALMADGE
                         PRESS THEM!

               WALLACE smiles. He grabs Hamish.

                                     WALLACE
                         Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and 
                         cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be 
                         sure the English see him ride away!

               Hamish hurries off with the message.

               The English infantry keeps moving across the little bridge.

               The Scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback.

               They have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         If he waits much longer --

               Hamish hurries up.

                                     HAMISH
                         Ride around and ford behind them!

                                     MORNAY
                         We should not divide our forces!

                                     HAMISH
                         Wallace says do it! And he says for 
                         you to let the English see you!

                                     MORNAY
                              (understanding)
                         They shall think we run away.

               Mornay leads his riders away.

               LORD TALMADGE

               sees the Scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to Cheltham...

                                     TALMADGE
                         See! Every Scot with a horse is 
                         fleeing! Hurry! Hurry!

               He drives half his army across the river.

               WALLACE

               lifts his sword.

                                     WALLACE
                         For Scotland!

               He charges down the hill...

               THE FIGHT AT STIRLING BRIDGE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               The Scots follow Wallace on foot, charging into the English.

               The English leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Press reinforcements across!

               The English leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers 
               onto the bridge, which only hams them up. Meanwhile, on the 
               other side of the bridge, Wallace and his charging men slam 
               into the English infantry with wild fury. The English fall 
               back on each other, further blocking the bridge.

               UP ON THE HILLTOP

               The nobles look back with grudging admiration.

                                     MORNAY
                         He's taking the bloody bridge! The 
                         English can't get across! He's evened 
                         the odds at one stroke!

               With rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur...

               DOWN ON THE PLAIN, Wallace and the attacking men drive the 
               English back, killing as they go. The Scots reach the bridge 
               itself. The waters below it run red with blood.

               Talmadge has begun to panic.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Use the archers!

                                     GENERAL
                         They're too close, we'll shoot out 
                         own men!

               ON THE BRIDGE

               the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; 
               nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he 
               swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight 
               beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old 
               Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English 
               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but 
               Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs 
               him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin 
               to build a barrier with the dead bodies.

               The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a 
               desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable 
               barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; 
               Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, 
               his hair, and his brain.

               TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining 
               English General tries to save the army.

                                     GENERAL
                         We are still five thousand! Rally!

               The English try to form up; but the Scottish horsemen, fording 
               the river high upstream, come crashing into the English flank 
               and ride over the surprised English infantry.

               AT THE BRIDGE, WALLACE

               sees the Scottish nobles attacking. The English soldiers are 
               in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.

               And the Scottish soldiers taste something Scots have not 
               tasted for a hundred years: victory. Even while finishing 
               off the last of the English soldiers, they begin their highlow 
               chant... Even the noblemen take up the chant!

               Wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies 
               on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on 
               the bridge; the bridge slick with blood.

               Before it can all sink in, William is lifted on the shoulders 
               of his men.

                                     SCOTTISH SOLDIERS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY

               William kneels before one of Scotland's ancient elders, who 
               lifts a silver sword and dubs William's shoulders.

                                     ELDER
                         I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

               William rises and faces the Great Hall, crowded with hundreds 
               of new admirers, as well as his old friends in their new 
               clothes and armor. The crowd chants --

                                     CROWD
                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace!!

               Wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. At the rear of the 
               hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained 
               glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he 
               sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment 
               of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a 
               gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in 
               the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, 
               and fingers the cloth she gave him.

               INT. SCOTTISH COUNCIL - DAY

               The nobles of Scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a 
               massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned 
               on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring 
               at each other. Old Craig is in the center, with young Robert 
               the Bruce on his right. There is a general MURMUR along the 
               nobles, and Robert whispers to Craig...

                                     ROBERT
                         Does anyone know his politics?

                                     CRAIG
                         No. But his weight with the commoners 
                         could unbalance everything. The 
                         Balliols will kiss his ass, so we 
                         must.

               A court STEWARDS steps in and formally announces...

                                     STEWARD
                         Lords of Scotland: Sir William 
                         Wallace!

               The nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other 
               in their acclamation as Wallace strides in, flanked by Hamish, 
               Campbell, and Stephen, splendid in their tartans.

               Old Craig rises.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William. In the name of God, we 
                         declare and appoint thee High 
                         Protector of Scotland! And thy 
                         captains as aides decamp!

               The nobles rise; court attendants hurry to Wallace and drape 
               a golden chain of office around his neck. Wallace takes the 
               three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the 
               necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud.

               Almost before the applause dies, a member of the BALLIOL 
               clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up...

                                     BALLIOL
                         Sir William!! Inasmuch as you and 
                         your captains hail from a region 
                         long known to support the Balliol 
                         clan, may we invite you to join us?

               But Wallace's gaze has locked onto Robert the Bruce, who 
               stares back, the two young lions instantly recognizing the 
               leadership power of each other.

                                     WALLACE
                         You are Robert the Bruce.

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         I am.

                                     WALLACE
                         My father fought in support of yours.

               The Balliols shrivel. The nobles on the Bruce side can barely 
               keep from grinning. Suddenly the men on the other end of the 
               table change their attack.

                                     BALLIOL
                         With this new success, the result of 
                         all of Scotland's efforts, now is 
                         the time to declare a king!

                                     MORNAY
                         Then you are prepared to recognize 
                         our legitimate succession!

                                     BALLIOL
                         You're the ones who won't support 
                         the true claim! I demand consideration 
                         of these documents!

               Wallace glances again at the Bruce, who suddenly feels ashamed 
               of the bickering.

                                     MORNAY
                         Those were lies when they were 
                         written! Our documents prove 
                         absolutely that --

               Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William! Where are you going?

                                     WILLIAM
                         We have beaten the English! But 
                         they'll come back, because you won't 
                         stand together. There is one clan in 
                         this country -- Scotsmen. One class -- 
                         free. One price -- courage.

               He turns again and strides toward the door.

                                     CRAIG
                         But... what will you do?

                                     WALLACE
                         I will invade England. And defeat 
                         the English on their own ground.

                                     CRAIG
                         Invade?! That's impossible, it --

               Wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length 
               of the table, bashing the succession documents into the laps 
               of the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands 
                         this! This!

               He brandishes the broadsword.

                                     WALLACE
                         There is a difference between us. 
                         You think the people of this country 
                         exist to provide you with position. 
                         I think your position exists to 
                         provide the people with freedom. And 
                         I go to make sure they have it.

               Wallace bangs through the door. Suppressing smiles, his 
               friends file out behind him.

               INT. EDINBURGH CORRIDOR - DAY

               Wallace and his men are marching away, as Robert the Bruce 
               runs out after them.

                                     ROBERT
                         Wait! ...I respect what you said. 
                         But remember, these men have lands, 
                         castles. Much to risk.

                                     WALLACE
                         And the common man who bleeds on the 
                         battlefield, does he risk less?

                                     ROBERT
                         No. But from top to bottom this 
                         country has no sense of itself. Its 
                         nobles share allegiance with England 
                         and its clans war with each other. 
                         If you make enemies on both sides of 
                         the border, you'll end up dead.

                                     WALLACE
                         We all end up dead. It's only a 
                         question of how. And why.

               Wallace walks; Robert catches up and speaks to him in an 
               urgent half whisper, so that no one else can hear.

                                     ROBERT
                         I'm no coward! I want what you want! 
                         But we need the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         Nobles? What does that mean -- to be 
                         noble? Your title gives you claim to 
                         the throne of our country. But men 
                         don't follow titles, they follow 
                         courage! Your arm speaks louder than 
                         your tongue. Our people know you. 
                         Noble and common, they respect you. 
                         If you would lead them toward freedom, 
                         they would follow you. And so would 
                         I.

               Wallace walks away, leaving Robert the Bruce alone.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY - DAY

               Wallace rides at the head of his army, moving through the 
               countryside of northern England. It is autumn, the foliage 
               is beautiful, the wheat fields gold with harvest.

               EXT. ESTABLISHING YORK CITY - DAY

               A medieval city guarded by a fortress.

               INT. THE FORTRESS - MAP ROOM - DAY

               The ROYAL GOVERNOR is a spoiled young man, Longshanks' nephew. 
               He is studying maps and written appeals for help; his CAPTAIN 
               of defenses strides in with another note.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Message from your cousin, the Prince. 
                         He says London has no more troops to 
                         send.

                                     GOVERNOR
                         Every town in Northern England is 
                         begging for help! Where will Wallace 
                         strike first?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I should think these smaller 
                         settlements along the border...

               They hear shouts as a rider arrives and dismounts. They look 
               out to see a panicked RIDER, who shouts up...

                                     RIDER
                         He advances!

                                     GOVERNOR
                         To what town?

                                     RIDER
                         He comes here!

                                                                  SMASH TO:

               CARTS, RUMBLING IN PANIC DOWN A ROAD

               as civilians flee the walled city in the distance.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY

               has cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels. It rumbles 
               ominously TOWARD CAMERA...

               THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell 
               of those leaving York.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY keeps coming on.

               INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY - DAY

               The governor is furious and confused.

                                     GOVERNOR
                         We will not allow a bandit to panic 
                         the greatest city in Northern England! 
                         Close off the escapes! Let no one 
                         leave!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The city has emptied already, Sire. 
                         Only the Scottish civilians remain.

               The Governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his 
               uncle, Longshanks the King.

               ON THE BATTERING RAM

               as it picks up speed and SLAMS into the wooden gate of the 
               city. With the collision, THE BATTLE IS ON. It's a night 
               battle: torches, flaming arrows, pots of boiling oil being 
               splashed down at the attackers, who swarm the gate.

               The oil beats the first wave of Scots back, but Wallace rushes 
               forward, grabbing the ram cart with his own hands; the 
               attackers rally to him, helping him slam the gate again and 
               again. It breaks; but behind it is an awful tangle of carts, 
               broken sheds, impenetrable rubbish. Wallace grabs a torch, 
               throws it into the wooden tangle, and shouts --

                                     WALLACE
                         Back! Wait for it to burn!

               INSIDE THE CITY

               The Captain hurries into the tower room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         They've breached the wall!

                                     GOVERNOR
                         Then do as I ordered.

               OUTSIDE THE WALLS

               The Scots wait, biding their time as the barrier burns.

               Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing 
               the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.

               They stare at this in mute shock. Wallace is frozen, his 
               eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction. His men rush forward.

                                     WALLACE
                         STOP! NOT YET! LISTEN TO ME!
                              (beat)
                         They wish to frighten us! Or goad us 
                         into attacking too soon! Don't look 
                         away! LOOK!

               The Scots look at the hanging bodies.

                                     WALLACE
                         Behold the enemy we fight! We will 
                         be more merciful than they have been. 
                         We will spare women, children, and 
                         priests. For all else, no mercy.

               Wallace draws his broadsword. The burning debris inside the 
               gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. Wallace 
               screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier.

               INT. THE PALACE IN LONDON - DAY

               Prince Edward and Phillip, his fencing friend and lover, 
               hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard 
               below; they look out the window and see the arrival of 
               Longshanks.

               They lean back into the room and Edward begins to pace 
               nervously.

                                     PHILLIP
                         It is not your fault! Stand up to 
                         him.

               Edward shows Phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt 
               behind his back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I will stand up to him, and more.

               Longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily. First 
               he glares at Phillip with obvious loathing, then turns his 
               piercing stare to his own son.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         What news of the north?

                                     EDWARD
                         Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent 
                         riders to speed any word.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         While I am in France fighting to 
                         expand your future kingdom I learn 
                         that Stirling castle is lost, our 
                         entire northern army wiped out! And 
                         you have done nothing?!

                                     EDWARD
                         I have ordered conscriptions...

               A messenger enters and hands the prince a message. Edward 
               reads it and nearly loses his balance.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace has sacked York!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Impossible.
                              (to messenger)
                         How dare you bring a panicky lie.

               The messenger has also brought a basket. He approaches the 
               central table with great dread and places the basket on it, 
               uncovering its contents. Prince Edward is closest; he looks 
               in, then staggers back, stunned. Longshanks moves to the 
               sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his 
               nephew, York's (former) Governor.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Sire! Thy own nephew! What beast 
                         could do such a thing?!

               The king drops the head back into the sack, unmoved.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         If he can sack York, he can invade 
                         lower England.

                                     PHILLIP
                         We would stop him!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Edward, who is this shitpoker who 
                         speaks to me as if I needed his 
                         advice?

                                     EDWARD
                         I have declared Phillip my High 
                         Counselor.

               Longshanks nods as if impressed. He moves to Phillip and 
               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears.

               Then Longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the 
               same one Edward and Phillip were looking out, six stories 
               above the courtyard. We hear Phillip's SCREAM as he falls.

               Edward rushes toward the window in horror. He looks out at 
               the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, 
               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it.

               He stabs at Longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, 
               parrying, letting his arms be cut.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You fight back at last!

               Then Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples 
               with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the 
               floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He 
               exhausts his fury on him.

               Edward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood.

               He ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the 
               discussion, as if this fight was normal business.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         We must sue for a truce, and buy him 
                         off. But who will go to him? Not I. 
                         If I came under the sword of this 
                         murderer, I would end up like my 
                         nephew. And not you, the sight of my 
                         faggot son would only encourage an 
                         enemy to take over this country. So 
                         whom do I send?

               Longshanks calculates.

               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY

               A full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase 
               the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points.

               Wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, 
               who receives a report from a scout.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         A royal entourage comes, flying 
                         banners of truce, and the standards 
                         of Longshanks himself!

               Wallace buckles on his sword.

               AN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY

               Set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men 
               ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent.

               There are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no 
               threatening moves.

               No sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle 
               of his broadsword, ready.

                                     WALLACE
                         Longshanks! I have come.

               Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, 
               slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the 
               shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only 
               one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and 
               Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another 
               dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves 
               toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion!

               She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!

               William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more 
               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she 
               carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.

               The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, 
               and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her.

               Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she 
               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life.

               She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive 
               yet proud curtsey.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I am the Princess of Wales.

                                     WALLACE
                         Wife of Edward, the king's son?

               She nods; somehow she is already ashamed.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I come as the king's servant, and 
                         with his authority.

                                     WALLACE
                         It's battle I want, not talk.

                                     PRINCESS
                         But now that I am here, will you 
                         speak with a woman?

               She leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading 
               rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous 
               walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg 
               like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and 
               Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, 
               shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, 
               so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots 
               surround the tent, ready for ambush.

               Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, 
               she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The 
               servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower 
               chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair.

               She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I understand that you have recently 
                         been given the rank of knight.

                                     WALLACE
                         I have been given nothing. God makes 
                         men what they are.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Did God make you the sacker of 
                         peaceful cities? The executioner of 
                         the king's nephew, my husband's own 
                         cousin?

                                     WALLACE
                         York was the staging point for every 
                         invasion of my country. And that 
                         royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, 
                         even women and children, from the 
                         city walls.

                                     PRINCESS
                         That is not possible.

               But knowing Longshanks' family, she glances at a richly 
               dressed Advisor, a CRONY of the king, who averts his eyes.

                                     WALLACE
                         Longshanks did far worse, the last 
                         time he took a Scottish city.

               The Crony mumbles to her in LATIN, WITH SUBTITLES...

                                     CRONY
                              (Latin)
                         He is a murdering bandit, he lies.

                                     WALLACE
                              (Latin!)
                         I am no bandit. And I do not lie.

               They are startled at Wallace's fluency in Latin.

                                     WALLACE
                         Or in French if you prefer that: 
                         Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to 
                         his face, and see if his eyes can 
                         convince you of the truth.

               She stares for a long moment at Wallace's eyes.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Hamilton, leave us.

                                     CRONY (HAMILTON)
                         M'lady --

                                     PRINCESS
                         Leave us now.

               He reluctantly obeys. Seeing that she wants the exchange to 
               be private, Wallace turns and nods for his men to leave.

               Stephen, who has been admiring the lady's beauty non-stop, 
               leans in and whispers to William...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Her husband's more of a queen than 
                         she is. Did you know that?

               Stephen moves off with Hamish and Campbell. Wallace and the 
               princess are left alone.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Let us talk plainly. You invade 
                         England. But you cannot complete the 
                         conquest, so far from your shelter 
                         and supply. The King proposes that 
                         you withdraw your attack. In return 
                         he grants you title, estates, and 
                         this chest with a thousand pounds of 
                         gold, which I am to pay to you 
                         personally.

                                     WALLACE
                         A Lordship. And gold. That I should 
                         become Judas.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Peace is made is such ways.

                                     WALLACE
                         SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!

               The outburst startles even those watching from a distance.

               The Princess is mesmerized by Wallace's passion.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I understand you have suffered. I 
                         know... about your woman.

                                     WALLACE
                         She was my wife. We married in secret 
                         because I would not share her with 
                         an English lord. They killed her to 
                         get to me. And she was pregnant.

               The Princess is stunned; Wallace is dead still.

                                     WALLACE
                         I've never told anyone. I don't know 
                         why I tell you -- except because you 
                         look... much like her. And someday 
                         you will be a queen, and you must 
                         open your eyes!
                              (beat)
                         Tell your king that William Wallace 
                         will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, 
                         while I live.

               The Princess rises slowly from her chair, moves in front of 
               him, and lowers herself to her knees. The Crony and her other 
               attendants, seeing this from a distance, are shocked.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Sir. I leave this money, as a gift. 
                         Not from the king, but from myself. 
                         And not to you, but to the orphans 
                         of your country.

               She lifts her face. Their eyes hold a moment too long.

               LATER, EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of 
               their company and watch as the Princess' procession leaves.

               Hamish studies Wallace's face; Wallace notices and gives him 
               a non-committal shrug. As the carriage rolls away, its window 
               curtains lift back slightly. All they see are the Princess' 
               fingers, but they know she looked back. Wallace reins his 
               horse away, to ride back to camp.

               INT. EDWARD'S PALACE - DAY

               The doors open; the Princess enters Longshanks' war council; 
               Prince Edward is there, among a dozen others.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled 
                         by the heathen. So he accepted our 
                         bribe.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. He did not.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Then why does he stay? My scouts say 
                         he has not advanced.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He waits. For you. He says he will 
                         attack no more towns -- if you are 
                         man enough to come fight him.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You spoke with this Wallace in 
                         private. What kind of man is he?

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king 
                         like you, M'lord.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         The Scottish nobles have sent him no 
                         support. His army starves. Our stall 
                         has worked, he must withdraw. You 
                         may return to your embroidery.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Humbly, M'lord.

               She barely curtseys, and starts out.

                                     EDWARD
                         You brought back the money, of course?

               He already knows she didn't; Hamilton is standing near him.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. I have it to ease the suffering 
                         of the children of this war.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                              (glances at son)
                         This is what happens when you must 
                         send a woman. And a fool.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Forgive me, Sire. I thought that 
                         generosity might demonstrate your 
                         greatness to those you mean to rule.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         My greatness is better demonstrated 
                         with this.

               From a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and 
               throws it onto the table. Most of those there are shocked.

                                     EDWARD
                         The weapon has been outlawed by the 
                         Pope himself!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         So the Scots will have none of them, 
                         will they? My armorers have already 
                         made a thousand.

               Longshanks smiles. No one notices that the Princess is deadly 
               pale.

               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY

               The Scots are lining up to leave their encampment. Wallace 
               is about to give the signal to start the march when Hamish, 
               beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in 
               distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be?

                                     HAMISH
                         William -- French guards?

               The riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes 
               a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. It is Nicolette.

               Wallace and Hamish recognize her from the Princess's visit.

               She trots her horse the rest of the way, while the French 
               guards stay back. Hamish helps her from her horse. She moves 
               to Wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding 
               cape.

               Secreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow.

               EXT. A FIELD IN SCOTLAND - DAY

               Wallace has gathered the nobles, among them Robert the Bruce, 
               Mornay, and old Craig, for a demonstration. Hamish and Stephen 
               have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. 
               As William cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position 
               and places a bolt in its slot, Stephen tucks a melon behind 
               the armor.

               William aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the air 
               and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt 
               what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale.

                                     CRAIG
                         That is why the Pope outlawed the 
                         weapon! It makes war too terrible.

                                     MORNAY
                         How many does Longshanks have?

                                     WALLACE
                         A thousand.
                              (beat)
                         You have made me Guardian of Scotland. 
                         So I tell you this is what we face.

                                     CRAIG
                         We must sue for peace.

                                     WALLACE
                         Peace?!

                                     CRAIG
                         We cannot defeat this --

                                     WALLACE
                         With cavalry -- not heavy, like the 
                         English, but light, fast horsemen, 
                         like you nobles employ -- we could 
                         outmaneuver their bowmen!

                                     CRAIG
                         It is suicide.

                                     ROBERT
                         Sir William --

               The Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to 
               intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great.

                                     WALLACE
                         We won at Stirling and still you 
                         quibbled! We won at York and you 
                         would not support us! Then I said 
                         nothing! Now I say you are cowards!

               The nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen 
               are ready to finish this quarrel right here. Robert the Bruce, 
               backed by Mornay, steps between the two sides.

                                     ROBERT
                         Please, Sir William! Speak with me 
                         alone! I beg you!

               The nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the 
               target Wallace shot, so they are alone.

                                     ROBERT
                         You have achieved more than anyone 
                         dreamed. But fighting these odds 
                         looks like rage, not courage. Peace 
                         offers its rewards! Has war become a 
                         habit you cannot break?

               The question strikes deep.

                                     WALLACE
                         War finds me willing. I know it won't 
                         bring back all I have lost. But it 
                         can bring what none of us have ever 
                         had -- a country of our own. For 
                         that we need a king. We need you.

                                     ROBERT
                         I am trying.

                                     WALLACE
                         Then tell me what a king is! Is he a 
                         man who believes only what others 
                         believe? Is he one who calculates 
                         the numbers for and against him but 
                         never weighs the strength in your 
                         own heart? There is strength in you. 
                         I see it. I know it.

                                     ROBERT
                         I must... consult with my father.

                                     WALLACE
                         And I will consult with mine.

               Robert the Bruce walks off the field, heading the way the 
               other nobles went. Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen. They 
               look to him; what do we do now?

                                     WALLACE
                         Remember when the English turned 
                         their hounds on us? Maybe we should 
                         introduce them to our dogs.

               INT. THE DARKENED ROOM OF BRUCE THE ELDER, THE LEPER

               In the faint nimbus of the single candle, young Robert sits 
               across from his leper father. The son grips his own head, as 
               if stunned by a blow.

                                     ROBERT
                         This... cannot be the way.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You have said yourself that the nobles 
                         will not support Wallace, so how 
                         does it help us to join the side 
                         that is slaughtered?

               Heartsick, the father reaches across the table, then stays 
               his arm, unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand.

                                     THE LEPER
                         My son. Look at me. I cannot be king. 
                         You, and you alone, can rule Scotland. 
                         What I tell you, you must do -- for 
                         yourself, and for your country.

               Young Robert holds his father with his eyes, and does not 
               look away.

               EXT. THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK - DAY

               The Scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain, covered in 
               the gray mists. They see glimpses of the enemy in the 
               distance. Wallace deploys the Scots: Campbell with the 
               schiltrons (spear formations), Stephen with the infantry, 
               the noble Mornay leading the cavalry, and with Wallace and 
               Hamish on horseback, looking over the field. Hamish sees 
               gazing up at an empty hill above the field.

                                     HAMISH
                         The Bruce is not coming, William.

                                     WALLACE
                         Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.

               He'd better, the odds look long. And it's nasty ground; one 
               side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English 
               are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick 
               smoke to hide their movements.

                                     WALLACE
                         Stephen ready?

                                     HAMISH
                         Aye.

               The Priest from their home village is moving through the 
               Scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. He reaches the two 
               friends, who accept the Host, say their own last prayers, 
               and give each other a look of goodbye. Hamish rides off to 
               join the schiltrons.

               LONGSHANKS AND HIS GENERALS

               on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward.

               WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

               see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking 
               for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!

               And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise. He 
               sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry. Some 
               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.

                                     WALLACE
                         Irish troops!

               STEPHEN OF IRELAND, WITH THE SCOTTISH INFANTRY

               He stares at the approach of his countrymen. Wallace appears 
               beside him. Stephen sees him, and is ashamed.

                                     STEPHEN
                         So that's where Longshanks got his 
                         soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill 
                         Scottish cousins for the English.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Their families are starving, they'll 
                         feed them however they can. If you 
                         don't want to fight them --

                                     STEPHEN
                         No. I'll stand with you.

               Loyal to the end. Wallace signals to Hamish and Campbell, 
               among the schiltrons. The formations, bristling with spears, 
               move forward. Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know 
               the spearmen are the bait here. Wallace and Stephen see the 
               English heavy cavalry advancing.

                                     STEPHEN
                         They can't be that stupid to attack 
                         the schiltrons again.

               Wallace is scanning the battlefield. He sees the English 
               cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, 
               they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.

                                     WALLACE
                         It's only a faint to shield the 
                         crossbows!

               The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. We see the 
               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you 
               can actually see them coming. The bows fall short of the 
               front ranks of the schiltrons.

                                     WALLACE
                         Now! Give 'em the dogs!

               Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers 
               with ten war dogs.

               Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp 
               protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long 
               catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their 
               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the 
               Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash 
               the dogs, fear races through the English line.

               The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, 
               and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, 
               mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; 
               their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked 
               off, the frenzied dogs keep killing.

               Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay 
               does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, 
               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and 
               are regrouping.

                                     WALLACE
                         Now! Charge! Charge them!

               Mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away.

               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND

               Longshanks and his officers see Mornay and his cavalry melt 
               away. The English general looks knowingly at Longshanks.

                                     GENERAL
                         Mornay?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         For double his lands in Scotland, 
                         and matching estates in England.

               WALLACE, WITH STEPHEN

               They see the Scottish army abandoned.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Betrayed!

               Wallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of Bruce.

               He looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another 
               volley. The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are 
               helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and 
               breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his 
               men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen 
               and the infantrymen race behind him.

               The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace 
               weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with 
               the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another...

               The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, 
               hacking the knights as they run by.

               The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the 
               Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; 
               the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the 
               armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, 
               regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.

               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND

               Longshanks and his generals are watching the action.

                                     GENERAL
                         My God, and still they come!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Use the reinforcements! But take 
                         Wallace alive!

               The General signals and the English reinforcements surge 
               into the battle.

               IN THE THICK OF THE BATTLE

               On horseback, Wallace fights his way into the watery edge of 
               the field, where English infantry is now overrunning the 
               schiltron. He hacks men down left and right, reaches the 
               Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another 
               soldier. Wallace dismounts.

                                     WALLACE
                         Hamish! Ham --

               And Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen 
               in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and 
               English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace 
               lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish...

                                     WALLACE
                         Get him away!

               Hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward 
               the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the 
               double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy.

               Rallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then 
               Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming.

                                     WALLACE
                         A charge! Form up! Form up!

               The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron.

               The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder 
               in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight 
               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting.

               Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp 
               body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending 
               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...

               Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The 
               Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over 
               William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams 
               into him, William also unseats the rider.

               The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet 
               him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.

               The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, 
               looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he 
               understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of 
               Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the 
               muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.

               Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He 
               batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him 
               absolution.

                                     ROBERT
                         Fight me! Fight me!

               But Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged 
               as he screams.

                                     ROBERT
                         FIGHT ME!

               All around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being 
               slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a 
               third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse.

               Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!

               He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to 
               the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!

               Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out 
               Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen 
               sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him 
               with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, 
               as Stephen mounts too.

               As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to 
               the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see 
               the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the 
               Scots.

               Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire 
               and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have 
               died along with his heart.

               LONGSHANKS

               Looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the 
               Scottish dead. For now, he is satisfied.

               EXT. ROAD - SUNSET

               Remnants of the defeated army straggle past. Wallace and 
               Stephen are trying to help Hamish carry his father, but now 
               old Campbell says...

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Son... I want to die on the ground.

               But as they tilt old Campbell onto the ground, he grabs at 
               something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. 
                         Goodbye, boys.

                                     HAMISH
                         No. You're going to live.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         I don't think I can do without one 
                         of those... whatever it is...

               Hamish is too grief-stricken to speak.

                                     WALLACE
                         You... were like my father...

               Old Campbell rallies one more time for this.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         ...And glad to die, like him... So 
                         you could be the men you are. All of 
                         ya.

               The last three words to Hamish, telling him he's a hero too.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         I'm a happy man.

               Hamish is weeping. When he looks up again, his father has 
               died. We PULL BACK from them in tableaux, with the army, the 
               people of Scotland, the whole gray world in defeat.

               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY

               Wallace, still bloody and in his battered armor, removes the 
               chain of office from beneath his breastplate, lays it onto 
               the table in front of Craig and the other nobles, and walks 
               from the room. Hamish and Stephen see the satisfaction on 
               the nobles' face, and follow William out.

               INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hamish and Stephen move out into the hallway after Wallace -- 
               but he is gone.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               Wallace is in the woods, in the grove of trees, looking at 
               Marion's hidden grave. The rain falls on his face, like tears. 
               But he has no tears of his own. The cold, the icy rain, the 
               wounds, nothing seems to touch him.

               With his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth 
               from beneath his breastplate; hanging in his trembling hands, 
               filthy with the grime and gore of battle, it looks impossibly 
               white, something from a better, purer world.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PALACE IN LONDON - NIGHT

               Thunder, the sound of driving rain. Snug by a massive fire 
               are Longshanks, his son Edward, and other advisors. On the 
               far side of the room, away from the fire, the Princess stands 
               at the window and watches the rain against the panes.

                                     ADVISOR
                         Their nobles have sworn allegiance, 
                         M'lord. Every last one.

               Longshanks savors the victory -- and gloats to his son.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Now we kill two birds at one stroke. 
                         We recruit from Scotland for our 
                         armies in France.

                                     EDWARD
                         The Scots will fight for us?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         What choice do they have? Now they 
                         must serve us or starve.

                                     EDWARD
                         But if we have not caught Wallace --

                                     LONGSHANKS
                              (exploding)
                         He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he 
                         has not yet bled to death or had his 
                         throat cut for him, he will not 
                         survive the winter. It is very cold -- 
                         is it not, our flower?

               From the other side of the window, we see the Princess as 
               she hears him, but doesn't turn around. She looks at the 
               window, we snow swirling among the raindrops outside. Her 
               eyes glisten, and her breath fogs the glass.

               INT. BRUCE'S DARKENED CHAMBER

               The elder Bruce, his decaying features sagging from his face, 
               stares across the table at his son.

                                     LEPER
                         I am the one who is rotting. But I 
                         think your face looks graver than 
                         mine.

                                     ROBERT
                         He was so brave. With courage alone 
                         he nearly won.

                                     LEPER
                         So more men were slaughtered 
                         uselessly!

                                     ROBERT
                         He broke because of me. I saw it. He 
                         lost all will to fight.

                                     LEPER
                         We must have alliance with England 
                         to prevail here. You achieved that! 
                         You saved your family, increased 
                         your lands! In time you will have 
                         all the power in Scotland!... Yet 
                         you grieve.

                                     ROBERT
                         In my heart I had begun to hope that 
                         he would never break.

                                     LEPER
                         All men lose heart. All betray. It 
                         is exactly why we must make the 
                         choices we make.

               INT. MORNAY'S CASTLE - NIGHT

               Mornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and 
               carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the 
               restless sleep of a tortured soul.

               He thinks he hears galloping. In SUBLIMINAL FLASHES he DREAMS 
               of Wallace riding toward him.

               He wakes, and listens to a strange noise. It is hoofbeats!

               Coming closer. He hears shouts too, screams from below -- 
               and those strange, approaching hoofbeats...

               WALLACE, ON HORSEBACK

               rides up the circular stairs inside Mornay's castle! His 
               horse bounds up the stone -- Mornay's guards are behind him, 
               on foot, pursuing.

               At a landing, Wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher.

               IN HIS BED, MORNAY

               sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and Wallace rides 
               through! Mornay is frozen. Wallace slashes him down.

               Out in the corridor, the guards gather; they have Wallace 
               trapped. He covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs 
               his flanks. The blind animal runs through the window!

               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT - SLOW MOTION

               The horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the 
               castle... and into the loch! Mornay's guards and the castle 
               servants cluster at the windows to see Wallace and the horse 
               surface, and swim to the shore, escaping!

               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE - DAY

               The news has spread through the countryside. In the town 
               square, drunken Scotsmen chant...

                                     PEOPLE
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               Old Craig rides past them, heading toward the Bruce's castle 
               on the hill above the town.

               INT. BRUCE CASTLE - DAY

               Robert is in his central room; he hears the chanting from 
               far below. Old Craig enters.

                                     ROBERT
                         Is it true about Mornay?

               Craig hands him the bloody nightshirt Mornay was wearing.

                                     ROBERT
                         And he rode through the window? My 
                         God.

               He can't hide his admiration. From below, he still hears the 
               people CHANTING...

               EXT. LONDON - GARDENS - DAY

               Longshanks and Edward are in the royal gardens, resplendent 
               with spring. Longshanks pulls a new flower, and crushes it.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         His legend grows! It will be worse 
                         than before!

                                     EDWARD
                         You let Wallace escape your whole 
                         army. You cannot blame me for this.

               Longshanks glowers at his son; the Princess arrives.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Good day to you, M'Lords.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mock us with a smile?

                                     PRINCESS
                         I am cheerful with a plan to soothe 
                         your miseries. All of England shudders 
                         with the news of renewed rebellion.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace's followers.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Wallace himself. If you wish to 
                         pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers 
                         in every Scottish town, I leave you 
                         to your hauntings. If you wish to 
                         take him, I know a way.

               Edward snickers in derision -- but his wife is steel.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have faced him. Have you?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Let her speak.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He will fight you forever. But what 
                         does he fight for? Freedom first, 
                         and peace. So grant them.

                                     EDWARD
                         The little cow is insane --

                                     PRINCESS
                         Grant, as you do everything else, 
                         with treachery. Offer him a truce to 
                         discuss terms, and send me to my 
                         castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. 
                         He trusts me. Pick thirty of your 
                         finest assassins for me to take along. 
                         And I will set the meeting, and the 
                         ambush.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You see, my delicate son? I have 
                         picked you a Queen.

               EXT. THE PRINCESS' SCOTTISH CASTLE - DAY

               Locharmbie is a small, picturesque castle on a hillside. As 
               the queen's entourage moves through the gates, they close 
               behind her. She steps out of the carriage and moves into

               INT. CASTLE - THE GREAT HALL - DAY

               Inside the great hall are thirty killers, led by their CHIEF 
               ASSASSIN, a cutthroat with a mangled eye.

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         We came in small groups, so the rebels 
                         would not suspect.

                                     PRINCESS
                         And you have reached Wallace's men?

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         We tell the villagers, and the 
                         traitors pass it on. All that's left 
                         is for you to say where.

               EXT. MARION'S GROVE - NIGHT

               Wallace is in the grove of trees where Marion is buried.

               Drinking in the silence, his own isolation. He hears a RUSTLE 
               behind him, and spins, drawing the broadsword. Then his face 
               registers... it's Hamish and Stephen.

               Hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here -- 
               unsure, until Wallace moves to them, and hugs them.

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               They are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's 
               dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance.

                                     WALLACE
                         Thanks for the food and drink. And 
                         for bringing 'em yourselves.

                                     HAMISH
                         We're here to stay. We don't care to 
                         live, if we can't fight beside ya.

               Stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket. He swigs, 
               hands it to Hamish for a chug, then to Wallace, who declines, 
               but smiles for the first time in many weeks.

                                     HAMISH
                         There is... one thing, William. 
                         Longshanks is offering a truce. He 
                         has dispatched his daughter-in-law 
                         as his emissary, and she has sent 
                         word that she wishes to meet you -- 
                         in a barn.

               Wallace frowns; a barn?

               EXT. A BARN IN THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Hauntingly similar to the one in Wallace's childhood. As he 
               sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a 
               white flag of truce, it gives him a chill. But in full view 
               of the barn, he hands Hamish his sword and rides forward.

               INSIDE THE BARN

               are the assassins, killing knives ready.

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         It's William Wallace, sure! And... 
                         he's given up his sword! Be ready!

               They position themselves at every entrance.

               OUTSIDE THE BARN

               Wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the 
               door. But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy 
               bar and seals the door! At this motion, Scots spring from 
               the woods in all directions. The assassins inside realize 
               the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they 
               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.

               More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place 
               tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on 
               fire. In moments the entire barn is blazing. The Scots stand 
               back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. 
               After awhile, there are no more screams from inside.

               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

               The Princess sees the burning off in the distance, like a 
               bonfire. She stands on the wall, looking out at it. And then 
               she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and 
               the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking 
               at the castle. She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and 
               stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is 
               silhouetted, and he can see her.

               The lone rider is William Wallace.

               CLOSE - A CANDLE

               being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into 
               the outer wall of the castle. AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns 
               like a tiny beacon. And William sees it.

               INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS

               sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.

               OUTSIDE THE CASTLE

               Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared 
               stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground.

               He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the 
               ledge. He looks through the window, and sees her inside.

               INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there. The first 
               glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for 
               him to come. Now, for a long, long moment the two of them 
               look at each other through the glass, each realizing the 
               implications of this moment.

               She moves to the window and opens it. The wind rushing through 
               extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. They face each 
               other in the darkness. Then she strikes a match and relights 
               the candle, and they look at each other.

                                     WALLACE
                         A meeting in a barn. It had to be a 
                         trap. And only you would know I would 
                         be aware of it.

                                     PRINCESS
                         It does me good to see you.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I am much diminished since we met.

               She wants to say something -- but instead she says something 
               else.

                                     PRINCESS
                         There will be a new shipment of 
                         supplies coming north next month. 
                         Food and weapons. They will trav --

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. Stop. I didn't come here for 
                         that.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Then why did you come?

                                     WALLACE
                         Why did you?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Because of the way you're looking at 
                         me now. The same way... as when we 
                         met.

               He turns his face away. Gently, she pulls it back.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I know. You looked at me... and saw 
                         her.

               He twists back toward the window.

                                     PRINCESS
                         You must forgive me what I feel. No 
                         man has ever looked at me as you 
                         did.

               Surprised, he looks at her now.

                                     WALLACE
                         You have... you have a husband.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have taken vows. More than one. 
                         I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, 
                         and sworn to give him a son. And I 
                         cannot keep both promises.

               Slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an 
               unexpected smile plays at his lips. Her smile lights too.

                                     PRINCESS
                         You understand. Consider, before you 
                         laugh and say no. You will never own 
                         a throne, though you deserve one. 
                         But just as the sun will rise 
                         tomorrow, some man will rule England. 
                         And what if his veins ran not with 
                         the blood of Longshanks, but with 
                         that of a true king?

                                     WALLACE
                         I cannot love you for the sake of 
                         revenge.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. But can you love me for the sake 
                         of all you loved and lost? Or simply 
                         love me... because I love you?

               Slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out.

               IN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED

               we see the surging, pent-up passion... and

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE LOVERS

               Their bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined. The first rays 
               of morning spread yellow light through the room and across 
               their faces.

               Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight! He grabs for his clothes, 
               as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of 
               bed, rushing to the window to look out.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No one! Hurry!

               He reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear 
               path down the wall to safety. He stops and looks at her, and 
               touches her face in gratitude. She has to ask...

                                     PRINCESS
                         When we... did you think of her?

               Pausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- 
               her, not Marion -- and climbs out. She watches him go.

               EXT. GROVE OF TREES - NIGHT

               Wallace stands alone in the grove where Marion lies.

               MONTAGE

               -- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way 
               to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing 
               and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, 
               as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked 
               and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men 
               away, the people cheering him...

               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Once again, Wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends.

                                     HAMISH
                         Rest, William.

                                     WALLACE
                         I rest.

                                     HAMISH
                         Your rest is making me exhausted.

               Stephen offers the jug; Wallace declines.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Come, it'll help you sleep.

                                     WALLACE
                         Aye. But it won't let me dream.

               Pulling a tattered tartan around himself, he lies down.

               LONGSHANKS, INT. HIS PALACE - NIGHT

               He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still 
               he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood. But he 
               ignores the ice in his lungs; his mind is plotting.

               THE PRINCESS, EXT. THE WALLS OF HER CASTLE - NIGHT

               she walks the parapets alone, lost in her own thoughts.

               ROBERT THE BRUCE, IN A STONE ROOM OF HIS CASTLE

               sits staring at... the stone coffin of his father. The coffin 
               is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his 
               father as a knight in final repose. Ranks of candles light 
               the scene, and Robert's face, cold as the stone. A SHUFFLE... 
               Robert looks up to see old Craig.

                                     CRAIG
                         May he rest in peace... You have 
                         already sealed the coffin?

                                     ROBERT
                         He was a modest man.

                                     CRAIG
                         It will not be long before Longshanks 
                         too is encased in stone, and his 
                         crowns divided for others to wear.

               Craig sits next to Robert, and keeps his voice low.

                                     CRAIG
                         Our nobles are frightened and 
                         confused... Wallace has the commoners 
                         stirred up again, from the Highland 
                         clans to the lowland villages. In 
                         another six months Christ and the 
                         Apostles could not govern this 
                         country.

               Robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.

                                     CRAIG
                         Longshanks knows his son will scarcely 
                         be able to rule England, much less 
                         half of France. He needs Scotland 
                         settled, and he trusts you, after 
                         Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he 
                         will recognize you as king of 
                         Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to 
                         this as well.

               He shows Robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in 
               Scotland. The Bruce barely glances at it.

                                     ROBERT
                         If I pay homage to another's throne, 
                         then how am I a king?

                                     CRAIG
                         Homage is nothing. It is the crown 
                         that matters!

                                     ROBERT
                         The crown is that of Scotland. And 
                         Scotland is William Wallace.

                                     CRAIG
                         That is another matter. There is a 
                         price to all this, required both by 
                         Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, 
                         and you will be our king. And we 
                         will have peace.

               Robert turns from his father's coffin, to look at Craig.

               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               A commotion; the nobles, their heads hooded, are led in on 
               horseback by guerrillas from the village. The nobles stop, 
               feel their hoods pulled off, and see Wallace.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William. We come to seek a 
                         meeting.

                                     WALLACE
                         You've all sworn to Longshanks.

                                     CRAIG
                         An oath to a liar is no oath at all. 
                         An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. 
                         Every man of us is ready to swear 
                         loyalty to you.

                                     WALLACE
                         So let the council swear publicly.

                                     CRAIG
                         We cannot. Some scarcely believe you 
                         are alive. Other think you'll pay 
                         them Mornay's wages. We bid you to 
                         Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, 
                         two days from now, at sunset. Pledge 
                         us your pardon and we will unite 
                         behind you. Scotland will be one.

               Wallace glances at Hamish and Stephen, who can barely hide 
               their contempt. Wallace looks at the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         I will meet you, but only one way -- 
                         if Robert the Bruce is there, and 
                         puts his hand on my Bible, and swears 
                         his loyalty to Scotland.

                                     CRAIG
                         He has already agreed to come.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Wallace stands alone, looking at the moon and stars. Hamish 
               moves up and sits down beside him.

                                     HAMISH
                         You know it's a trap.

                                     WALLACE
                         Probably. But we can't win alone. We 
                         know that. This is the only way.

                                     HAMISH
                         I don't want to be a martyr.

                                     WALLACE
                         Nor I! I want to live! I want a home 
                         and children and peace. I've asked 
                         god for those things. But He's brought 
                         me this sword. And if He wills that 
                         I must lay it down to have what He 
                         wants for my country, then I'll do 
                         that too.

                                     HAMISH
                         That's just a dream, William!

                                     WALLACE
                         We've lived a dream together. A dream 
                         of freedom!

                                     HAMISH
                         Your dreams aren't about freedom! 
                         They're about Marion! You have to be 
                         a hero, because you think she sees 
                         you! Is that it?

                                     WALLACE
                         My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed 
                         them myself. If I knew I could live 
                         with her on the other side of death, 
                         I'd welcome it.

               EXT. ROAD INTO EDINBURGH - SUNSET

               William, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking 
               down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his 
               dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it 
               to Hamish.

                                     HAMISH
                         Keep these. We're going too.

                                     WALLACE
                         No. One of us is enough.

               Wallace hugs them, first Stephen, then Hamish. Tears roll 
               down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, 
               Wallace rides away.

               EXT. LARGE ESTATE HOUSE - SUNSET

               The house looks quiet as Wallace rides toward it.

               INT. ESTATE HOUSE - DAY

               Robert the Bruce and Craig stand at the hearth, tense.

                                     CRAIG
                         He won't come.

                                     ROBERT
                         He will. I know he will.

               They hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks 
               out to see Wallace arriving.

                                     ROBERT
                         Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a 
                         brave heart.

               OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Wallace dismounts and enters.

               INT. THE HOUSE

               Wallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops.

               Bruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. 
               Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto 
               Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters 
               drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace.

               English soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, 
               and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if 
               broadswords might spring from his boots.

               They bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the 
               Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out 
               the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs 
               the English Captain of the soldiers.

                                     ROBERT
                         He is not to be harmed. I have your 
                         king's absolute promise that he will 
                         be imprisoned only!

               The Captain looks at Bruce the way the High Priest must have 
               looked at Judas, and leaves.

                                     CRAIG
                         Now we will have peace.

               Robert the Bruce spots something on the floor that must have 
               fallen from Wallace's clothes as they grabbed him; Bruce 
               lifts the white handkerchief, and sees the familiar thistle 
               embroidered on it.

               EXT. ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY

               A procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way 
               toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his 
               head bare to the sun. Country people come out to jeer...

                                     PEOPLE
                         Don't look so fearsome, does he?!

               A thrown rock careens off Wallace's check; rotten fruit slaps 
               his shirt. His lips are so parched they bleed.

               INT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY

               Edward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, 
               breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves.

               INT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY

               The Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's 
               bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Is it true? Wallace is captured?

                                     EDWARD
                         Simply because he eluded your trap, 
                         do you think he is more than a man? 
                         My father is dying. Perhaps you should 
                         think of our coronation.

                                     PRINCESS
                         When will his trial be?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace's? For treason there is no 
                         trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, 
                         then executed.

               With a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face.

               INT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY

               The Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig.

                                     ROBERT
                         Longshanks promised!

                                     CRAIG
                         You are surprised he would lie? 
                         Balliol was murdered in a church 
                         yesterday. You are Longshanks' new 
                         designate. You will be king.

               INT. TOWER DUNGEON

               Wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of Hannibal 
               Lecter. Before him are six scarlet-robed royal magistrates.

                                     ROYAL MAGISTRATE
                         William Wallace! You stand in taint 
                         of high treason.

               We PUSH IN on the iron mask that binds his face. We can only 
               see his eyes -- but they are bright.

                                     WALLACE
                         Treason. Against whom?

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Against thy king, thou vile fool! 
                         Hast thou anything to say?

                                     WALLACE
                         Never, in my whole life, did I swear 
                         allegiance to your king --

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         It matters not, he is thy king!

                                     WALLACE
                         -- while many who serve him have 
                         taken and broken his oath many times. 
                         I cannot commit treason, if I have 
                         never been his subject!

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Confess, and you may receive a quick 
                         death. Deny, and you must be purified 
                         by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU 
                         CONFESS?!

                                     WALLACE
                         I do not confess.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive 
                         they purification... And in the end, 
                         I promise you'll beg for the axe.

               EXT. ESTABLISHING - THE TOWER

               The stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to 
               this day as the Wallace Tower.

               INT. PRISON - NIGHT

               Wallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints.

               We can only see his eyes, as he prays.

                                     WALLACE
                         I am so afraid... Give me strength.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL DOOR

               The jailers jump to their feet as the Princess enters.

                                     JAILER
                         Your Highness!

                                     PRINCESS
                         I will see the prisoner.

                                     JAILER
                         We've orders from the king --

                                     PRINCESS
                         The king will be dead in a month! 
                         And his son is a weakling! Who do 
                         you think will rule this kingdom? 
                         Now OPEN THIS DOOR!

               The jailer obeys. The Princess can barely contain her shock 
               at the sight of Wallace; the jailers snatch him upright.

                                     JAILER
                         On your feet, you filth!

                                     PRINCESS
                         Stop! Leave me!
                              (they hesitate)
                         There is no way out of this hell! 
                         Leave me with him!

               Reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they 
               can still see her back and hear her. Looking at Wallace's 
               eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears -- 
               dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. Wallace tries 
               to distract her.

                                     WALLACE
                         M'lady... what kindness of you to 
                         visit a stranger.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Sir, I... come to beg you to confess 
                         all, and swear allegiance to the 
                         king, that he might show you mercy.

                                     WALLACE
                         Will he show mercy to my country? 
                         Will he take back his soldiers, and 
                         let us rule ourselves?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps 
                         even live in the Tower. In time, who 
                         knows what can happen, if you can 
                         only live.

                                     WALLACE
                         If I swear to him, then everything I 
                         am is dead already.

               She wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the 
               tears. And the jailers are watching.

                                     WALLACE
                         Your people are lucky to have a 
                         princess so kind that she can grieve 
                         at the death of a stranger.

               She almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but 
               she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading...

                                     PRINCESS
                         You will die! It will be awful!

                                     WALLACE
                         Every man dies. Not every man really 
                         lives.

               She pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers...

                                     PRINCESS
                         Drink this! It will dull your pain.

                                     WALLACE
                         It will numb my wits, and I must 
                         have them all. If I'm senseless, or 
                         if I wail, then Longshanks will have 
                         broken me.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I can't bear the thought of your 
                         torture. Take it!

               On the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air 
               hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing 
               suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, 
               her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the 
               mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits 
               the purple drug out through the mouth hole.

               INT. LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               Longshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption.

               Edward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his 
               eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have come to beg for the life of 
                         William Wallace.

                                     EDWARD
                         You fancy him.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I respect him. At worst he was a 
                         worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou 
                         great king... and win the respect of 
                         your own people.

               Longshanks shakes his head.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Even now, you are incapable of mercy?

               The king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes.

               The princess looks at her husband.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Nor you. To you that word is as 
                         unfamiliar as love.

                                     EDWARD
                         Before he lost his powers of speech, 
                         he told me his one comfort was that 
                         he would live to know Wallace was 
                         dead.

               She leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The 
               guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's 
               eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once 
               showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses 
               to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear...

                                     PRINCESS
                         You see? Death comes to us all. And 
                         it comes to William Wallace. But 
                         before death comes to you, know this: 
                         your blood dies with you. A child 
                         who is not of your line grows in my 
                         belly. Your son will not sit long on 
                         the throne. I swear it.

               She lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back 
               onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband 
               she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the 
               dying king rasping the air like a saw.

               EXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY

               The crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer 
               from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped 
               to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through 
               the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: 
               chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards.

               We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in 
               terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street 
               and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.

               Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing 
               his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest 
               of the crowd jeers more.

               Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution 
               platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table 
               with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an 
               enormous axe. Wallace sees it all.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         We will use it all before this is 
                         over. Or fall to your knees now, 
                         declare yourself the king's loyal 
                         subject, and beg his mercy, and you 
                         shall have it.

               He emphasizes "mercy" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is 
               pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows 
               noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...

               WE INTERCUT:

               -- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE 
               from her room in the palace...

               -- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, 
               helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain.

               -- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches.

               -- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in 
               Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered 
               handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.

               ON THE EXECUTION STAND

               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around 
               Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.

                                     CROWD
                         That's it! Stretch him!

               In the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries 
               through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace 
               is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the 
               executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go 
               too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods 
               and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the 
               platform; the Magistrate leans to him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, 
                         kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, 
                         and you will feel no more.

               With great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate 
               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak.

               Wallace struggles all the way to his feet.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Very well then. Rack him.

               The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, 
               spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by 
               the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet 
               enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and 
               Stephen feel it in their own bodies.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Wonderful, isn't it, that a man 
                         remains conscious through such pain. 
                         Enough?

               Wallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, 
               take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we 
               see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, 
               but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; 
               Wallace wants to say something.

                                     WALLACE
                         That... will... clear your sinuses.

               Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears.

               Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift 
               the terrible instruments of dissection.

               We are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE 
               as the disembowelment begins. The Magistrate leans in beside 
               him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         It can all end. Right now! Bliss. 
                         Peace. Just say it. Cry out. "Mercy!" 
                         Yes?... Yes?

               The crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the 
               procedure, and they goad Wallace, chanting...

                                     CROWD
                         Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy!

               Wallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals QUIET!

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (booming)
                         The prisoner wishes to say a word!

               SILENCE. Hamish and Stephen weep, whisper, pray...

                                     HAMISH AND STEPHEN
                         Mercy, William... Say Mercy...

               Wallace's eyes flutter, and clear. He fights through the 
               pain, struggles for one last deep breath, and screams...

                                     WALLACE
                         FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM!

               The shout RINGS through the town. Hamish hears it. The 
               Princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, 
               just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. Longshanks 
               and his son seem to hear; the cry STILL ECHOES as if the 
               wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert 
               the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as 
               if he has heard...

               IN THE LONDON SQUARE

               the crowd has never seen courage like this; even English 
               strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives 
               a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his 
               head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and 
               Wallace looks toward the crowd.

               THE CROWD, WALLACE'S POV

               He sees Hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing...

               SLOW MOTION - THE AXE

               begins to drop.

               WALLACE'S POV

               In the last half-moment of his life, when he has already 
               stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone 
               standing at Hamish's shoulder. She is beautiful, smiling, 
               serene.

               She is Marion.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               ROBERT THE BRUCE

               His face has changed. He is standing AT THE OPEN GRAVE WHERE 
               MARION LAY, the headstone carved with the thistle still there. 
               He holds the handkerchief. As he tucks it into his own pocket, 
               and we MOVE IN on his eyes, we realize the VOICE OVER belongs 
               to him.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         After the beheading, William Wallace's 
                         body was torn to pieces. His head 
                         was set on London bridge, where 
                         passerby were invited to jeer at the 
                         man who had caused so much fear in 
                         England.
                              (beat)
                         His arms and legs were sent to the 
                         four corners of Britain as warning.

               EXT. SCOTTISH TOWNS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               We see the people, as the remains of William Wallace are 
               displayed in a box. The faces of the young men are fiery.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         It did not have the effect that 
                         Longshanks planned.

               More young men put on tartans, take up their weapons, and 
               gather into fighting units. Among them is Hamish, carrying a 
               shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword, 
               and the words "For Freedom."

               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

               Robert the Bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of 
               the Scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of Scots, 
               sits on his horse and looks down at the English generals in 
               their martial finery. The English are haughty, victorious, 
               at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the 
               ceremony of submission from Scotland's new king.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a 
                         body of Scottish veterans, rode out 
                         to pay homage to the armies of the 
                         English king, and accept his 
                         endorsement of my crown.

               FROM BELOW, ON THE OPEN PLAIN - DAY

               The Scots -- the remains of William Wallace's army -- look 
               so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait. 
               One ENGLISH COMMANDER turns and jokes with another...

                                     ENGLISH COMMANDER
                         I hope you washed your ass this mornin -- 
                         it's never been kissed by a king 
                         before.

               UP ON THE HILL, Robert the Bruce sits on his horse, and waits. 
               He looks down at the English generals, at their banners, 
               their army. He looks down the ranks at his own.

               He sees Hamish. Stephen. Old MacClannough is there, his eyes 
               watery, his weapon sharp. The Scottish bride Lord Bottoms 
               took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside 
               her. Robert knows none of them -- yet he knows them all.

               Old Craig, among the other Scottish nobles mounted beside 
               the Bruce, grows impatient.

                                     CRAIG
                         Come, let's get it over with.

               But Robert holds something -- uncurling his fist, he looks 
               at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to Wallace. The 
               nobles start to rein their horses toward the English.

                                     ROBERT
                         Stop.

               Robert the Bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his 
               breastplate, and turns to the Highlanders who line the hilltop 
               with him. He takes a long breath, and shouts --

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed 
                         with me!

               Bruce's broadsword slides from its scabbard. A cry rises 
               from Highlanders, as from a tomb, rising --

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               The chant builds to a frenzy; it shakes the earth. The 
               Scottish nobles can scarcely believe it; the English are 
               shocked even more. Robert the Bruce, king of Scotland, spurs 
               his horse into full gallop toward the English, and the 
               Highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill, ready to run 
               through hell itself. In SLOW MOTION we see their faces...

               And OVER THIS, we hear the voice of William Wallace...

                                     WALLACE'S VOICE
                         In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots 
                         of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, 
                         charged the fields of Bannockburn. 
                         They fought like warrior poets. They 
                         fought like Scotsmen. And won their 
                         freedom. Forever.

               On Wallace's army behind Robert the Bruce, charging down the 
               hill to victory and glory, we slow to FREEZE FRAME and hear 
               their chant, huge, echoing...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

                                                                  FADE OUT:

nail, shot close of his hands slightly quivering with
inner tension.)

Father, bothered, hanging up.            The match in A.'s hand

F. startled, very distant, slowly wondering aloud:

                      You really are sick . . . You
                     have no idea      really of what
                      reality is.
A, turning around at entrance to elevator which opens
as he talks.                                 Then softer:
                Looking at Father hard.
                                           Right here.

self clean, his beard barely visible, although there are
small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar
under his left eye, the result of a previous wound, not
serious.    He tends to rub it occasionally.    Ironically,    in
the war, he has become even softer. Time has crumbled:
he is spacing himself.

             As Adams is wandering around in his head, camera
moves from A. to Jeremiah (called Rhah)       who is strutting
up very confidently, his walk snake-like, all waves, un-

              Rhah looking at Lerner hard with distaste.
              Rhah:     If you're going to do it, do it right.

Then a chant begins in the blackness, a Dionysl'an             chant
or something similar.

          The chant is repetitive, accompanied by a tarn-
bourine, but in this repetitiveness, in this lack of desire
to search for new interpretations, there is a real feeling
for love, which is really a source without words.
 60                The screen slowly comes to light and we see a
young tribe, maybe a dozen, dancing freely in the forest by
a stream.        Perhaps they are the enemy, it is not made clear
yet.     They are a mixture of young men and women and their
children, white and black.                  They dance hugging each other,
their long hair jumping, in all sorts of love contortions
that display their freedom.                     They are all in love with each
other, with                                                         And easy as it iS

companions are taking back at the stream.

     inside the school including Bender's locker.

               High School, Shermer, Illinois.
               60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
               the fact that we had to sacrifice a
               whole Saturday in detention for
               whatever it was that we did wrong,
               what we did was wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make us write this
               essay telling you who we think we
               are, what do you care?  You see us
               as you want to see us...in the
               simplest terms and the most
               convenient definitions.  You see us
               as a brain, an athelete, a basket
               case, a princess and a criminal.
               Correct?  That's the way we saw each
               other at seven o'clock this morning.
               We were brainwashed...

2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY

     We see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the
     parking lot.

     Claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob.

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you can't get me
               out of this...I mean it's so absurd
               I have to be here on a Saturday!
               It's not like I'm a defective or
               anything...

                       CLAIRE'S FATHER
               I'll make it up to you...Honey,
               ditching class to go shopping
               doesn't make you a defective.  Have
               a good day.

     Claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks
     up the school front steps

3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY

     We are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is
     his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Is this the first time or the last
               time we do this?

               to your advantage...

                            BRIAN
               Mom, we're not supposed to study; we
               just have to sit there and do
               nothing.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well mister you figure out a way to
               study.

                    BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well go!

     Brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school.

4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY

     We see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock;
     hes wearing a lettermans jacket with lots of patches on it.

                       ANDREW'S FATHER
               Hey, I screwed around...guys screw
               around, there's nothing wrong with
               that.  Except you got caught, Sport.

               Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?

5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAY

     We see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing
     sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't
     stop walking.

     The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.

     Bender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps
     ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps
     forward to look in the car's front window and the car
     drives away.

6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     There are six tables in two rows of three.
     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in
     and sits at the table behind her.

     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.

     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
     desk and takes a few things in the process.

     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian
     reluctantly gets up and moves.

     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
     feet up.

     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the
     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
     Brian.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.

     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.

     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack
     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with
     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
     job.

                            VERNON
               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want
               to congradulate you for being on
               time...

     Claire raises her hand.

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's
               been a mistake.  I know it's
               detention, but...um...I don't think
               I belong in here...

     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.

                            VERNON
               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have
               exactly eight hours and fifty-four
               minutes to think about why you're
               here.  To ponder the error of your
               ways...

     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
     mouth again.

     Claire looks like she is going to gag.

                            VERNON
               ...and you may not talk.  You will
               not move from these seats.

     He glances up at Bender and points at him.

                            VERNON
               ...and you...

     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.

                            VERNON
               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,
               we're gonna try something a little
               different today.  We are going to
               write an essay--of no less than a
               thousand words--describing to me
               who you think you are.

                            BENDER
               Is this a test?

     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
     of Bender.

                            VERNON
               And when I say essay...I mean essay.
               I do not mean a single word repeated
               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.
               Bender?

     Bender looks up.

                            BENDER
               Crystal...

                            VERNON
               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little
               something about yourself.  Maybe
               you'll even--decide whether or not
               you care to return.

     Brian raises his hand and then stands.

                            BRIAN
               You know, I can answer that right
               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
               'cause...

                            VERNON
               Sit down Johnson...

                            BRIAN
               Thank you sir...

     He sits.

                            VERNON
               My office...

     Vernon points.

                            VERNON
               ...is right across that hall.  Any
               monkey business is ill-advised...

     He looks around at them.

                            VERNON
               ...any questions?

                            BENDER
               Yeah...I got a question.

     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.

                            BENDER
               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his
               wardrobe?

                            VERNON
               I'll give you the answer to that
               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
               Don't mess with the bull young man,
               you'll get the horns.

     Vernon leaves.

                            BENDER
               That man...is a brownie hound...

     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is
     Allison, biting her nails.

     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is
     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.

                            BENDER
               You keep eating your hand and you're
               not gonna be hungry for lunch...

     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.

                            BENDER
               I've seen you before, you know...

     We see Vernon look out from his office.

     We see Brian playing with his pen.

                            BRIAN
                    (quietly to himself)
               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?
               Who are you?

     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
     under his upper lip.

                            BRIAN
               I am a walrus...

     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices
     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
     embarrassed.

     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing
     his jacket.

     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands
     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket
     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still
     staring at him.

                            BRIAN
               It's the shits, huh?

     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
     laugh.

     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He
     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's
     head.

     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
     Bender.

     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
     song.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to herself)
               I can't believe this is really
               happening to me...

     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.

                            BENDER
               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do
               if we hafta take a piss?

                            CLAIRE
                    (disgusted)
               Please...

                            BENDER
               If you gotta go...

     We hear Bender unzip his fly.

                            BENDER
               You gotta go!

     Everyone is now looking at Bender.

                            CLAIRE
                   (disgusted)
               Oh my God!

                            ANDREW
               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!

                            BENDER
               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes
               it crawl back up!

                            ANDREW
               You whip it out and you're dead
               before the first drop hits the
               floor!

     Bender gasps mockingly.

                            BENDER
               You're pretty sexy when you get
               angry...grrr!

     He turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Hey, homeboy...

     Brian points at himself with his pen.

                            BENDER
              ...why don't you go close that door.
               We'll get the prom queen--
               impregnated!

     Claire turns and glares at him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!

     Bender ignores him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!
                          BENDER
               What?

                            ANDREW
               If I lose my temper, you're totalled
               man!

                            BENDER
               Totally?

                            ANDREW
               Totally!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody
               here is interested!

                            ANDREW
               Really!
                    (to Claire about Bender)
               Buttface!

                            BENDER
               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to
               get in here?  Forget to wash your
               jock?

                            BRIAN
                    (nervous)
               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we
               should just write our papers...

                            ANDREW
                    (to Bender)
               Look, just because you live in here
               doesn't give you the right to be a
               pain in the ass...so knock it off!

     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.

                            BENDER
               It's a free country...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               He's just doing it to get a rise out
               of you!  Just ignore him...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if
               you tried!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                           BENDER
               So...so!
                    (to Andrew and Claire)
               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-
               friend?
                    (a beat)
               Steady dates?
                    (another beat)
               Lo--vers?
                    (another beat)
               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do
               you slip her the hot...beef...
               injection?

     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screams)
               Go to hell!

                            ANDREW
                    (screams)
               Enough!

                                                  CUT TO:

7. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     We see Vernon in his office.

                            VERNON
                    (yells)
               Hey!  What's going on in there?
                    (to himself)
               Smug little pricks!
                                                  CUT TO:

8. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from
     Bender.

                            ANDREW
                    (to himself)
               Scumbag!

     Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits
     on it.

                            BENDER
               What do you say we close that door.
               We can't have any kind of party
               with Vernon checking us out every
               few seconds.

                            BRIAN
               Well, you know the door's s'posed to
               stay open...

                           BENDER
               So what?

                           ANDREW
               So why don't you just shut up!
               There's four other people in here
               you know...

                            BENDER
               God, you can count.  See!  I knew
               you had to be smart to be a...a
               wrestler.

                            ANDREW
               Who the hell are you to judge
               anybody anyway?

                            CLAIRE
               Really...

                            ANDREW
               You know, Bender...you don't even
               count.  I mean if you disappeared
               forever it wouldn't make any
               difference.  You may as well not
               even exist at this school.

     Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
     before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out,
     however.

                            BENDER
               Well...I'll just run right out and
               join the wrestling team.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
     Bender.

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Maybe the prep club too!  Student
               council...

                            ANDREW
               No, they wouldn't take you.

                            BENDER
               I'm hurt.

                            CLAIRE
               You know why guys like you knock
               everything...

                            BENDER
                    (to himself)
               Oh, this should be stunning...

                            CLAIRE
               It's 'cause you're afraid.

                            BENDER
                    (with mock enthusiasm)
               Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart,
               that's exactly why I'm not heavy in
               activities!

                            CLAIRE
               You're a big coward!

     Brian feels left out.

                            BRIAN
                    (to no one imparticular)
               I'm in the math club...

                            CLAIRE
               See you're afraid that they won't
               take you.  You don't belong so you
               just have to dump all over it...

                            BENDER
               Well...it wouldn't have anything to
               do with you activities people being
               assholes...now would it?

                            CLAIRE
               Well you wouldn't know...You don't
               even know any of us.

                            BENDER
               Well, I don't know any lepers
               either, but I'm not gonna run out
               and join one of their fucking clubs.

                            ANDREW
               Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?

     Brian again feels he needs to contribute.

                            BRIAN
               I'm in the physics club too...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               S'cuse me a sec...
                    (to Brian)
               What are you babbling about?

                            BRIAN
               Well, what I said was...I'm in the
               math club, the Latin club and the
               physics club...physics club.

     Bender nods and turns to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the
               physics club?

                            CLAIRE
               That's an academic club...

                            BENDER
               So?

                            CLAIRE
               So...academic clubs aren't the same
               as other kinds of clubs.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but to dorks like him...

     Bender points at Brian.

                            BENDER
               ...they are.
                    (to Brian)
               What do you guys do in your club?

                            BRIAN
               In physics, um, we ah, we talk about
               physics...about properties of physics.

                            BENDER
               So it's sorta social...demented and
               sad, but social.  Right?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, well, I guess you could
               consider it a social situation.  I
               mean there are other children in my
               club and uh, at the end of the year
               we have, um, you know, a big
               banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.

                            BENDER
               You load up, you party...

                            BRIAN
               Well, no, we get dressed up...I
               mean, but, we don't...we don't get
               high.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Only burners like you get high...

                            BRIAN
               And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
               So I had to borrow my dad's.  It
               was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
               like me to wear other people's
               shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my
               cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
               He got high once and you know, he
               started eating like really weird
               foods.  And uh, and then he just
               felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
               You know, kinda like, you know
               "Twilight Zone" kinda.

                            CLAIRE
                    (laughs)
                    (to Bender)
               Sounds like you...

                            ANDREW
               Look, you guys keep up your talking
               and Vernon's gonna come right in
               here...I got a meet this Saturday
               and I'm not gonna miss it on account
               of you boneheads...

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

     Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.

                            BENDER
               Missing a whole wrestling meet!

                            ANDREW
               Well you wouldn't know anything
               about it, faggot!  You never competed
               in your whole life!

                            BENDER
                    (with mock hurt)
               Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
               because of it.  I have such a deep
               admiration for guys that roll around
               on the floor with other guys!

                            ANDREW
               Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You
               don't have any goals.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but I do!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah?

                            BENDER
               I wanna be just--like--you!  I
               figure all I need's a labotamy and
               some tights!

     Brian becomes interested.

                            BRIAN
               You wear tights?

                            ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               No I don't wear tights, I wear the
               required uniform...

                            BRIAN
               Tights...

                            ANDREW
                    (defensive)
               Shut up!

     They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
     quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
     Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table.
     Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and
     gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors
     that separate the library from the hallway.

                            BRIAN
               You know there's not s'posed to be
               any monkey business!

     Bender turns and points at Brian.

                            BENDER
                    (in a stern voice)
               Young man...have you finished your
               paper?

     Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks
     around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.

                            CLAIRE
               What are you gonna do?

                            ANDREW
               Drop dead, I hope!
                                                  CUT TO:

9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands
     up and checks the way he looks in a mirror.  He does a
     muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish Cobadonga!
                                                  CUT TO:

10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Brian looks up.  Bender is messing with the door to the
     library.

                            BRIAN
               Bender, that's, that's school
               property there...you know, it doesn't
               belong to us.  It's something not to
               be toyed with.

     The door slams shut.  Bender runs back to his seat.

                            ANDREW
               That's very funny, come on, fix it!

                            BRIAN
               You should really fix that!

                            BENDER
               Am I a genius?

                            ANDREW
               No, you're an asshole!

                            BENDER
               What a funny guy!

                            ANDREW
               Fix the door Bender!

                            BENDER
               Everyone just shhh!
                                                  CUT TO:

11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon walking back to his office.  He stops and
     listens to them through the closed door.

                         BENDER (OS)
               I've been here before, I know what
               I'm doing!

                         ANDREW (OS)
               No!  Fix the door, get up there and
               fix it!

                         BENDER (OS)
                    (screams)
               Shut up!
                                                  CUT TO:

12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     He opens the door and storms in.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

     For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare
     at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

                            BENDER
               How're we s'posed to know?  We're
               not s'posed to move, right?

     Vernon turns to Claire.

                            VERNON
               Why?

                            CLAIRE
               We were just sitting here, like we
               were s'posed to...

     Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.

                            VERNON
               Who closed that door?

                            BENDER
               I think a screw fell out of it...

                            ANDREW
               It just closed, sir...

     Vernon looks at Allison in the back.

                            VERNON
               Who?

     Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the
     table, hiding in her jacket hood.

                            BENDER
               She doesn't talk, sir...

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Give me that screw...

                            BENDER
              I don't have it...

                            VERNON
               You want me to yank you outta that
               seat and shake it out of you?

                            BENDER
               I don't have it...screws fall out
               all of the time, the world's an
               imperfect place...

                            VERNON
               Give it to me, Bender...

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir, why would anybody
               want to steal a screw?

                            VERNON
                    (to Claire)
               Watch it, young lady...

     Vernon goes over to the door.  He tries to hold it open
     by putting a folding chair in front of it.

                            BENDER
               The door's way too heavy, sir.

     The door slams shut despite the chair.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     They laugh.

     Vernon opens the door again.  He comes back in.

                            VERNON
                    (pointing)
               Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on,
               front and center, let's go.

     Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon.

                            BENDER
               Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
               If he gets up, we'll all get up,
               it'll be anarchy!

     Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel
     magazine rack in front of the door.

                            VERNON
              Okay, now, watch the magazines!

                            BENDER
               It's out of my hands...

     They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire
     door.

                            BENDER
               That's very clever sir, but what if
               there's a fire?  I think violating
               fire codes and endangering the
               lives of children would be unwise
               at this juncture in your career, sir.

     Vernon thinks about it.  He turns to Andrew.

                            VERNON
               Alright, what are you doing with
               this?  Get this outta here for God's
               sake!  What's the matter with you?
               Come on!

                            BRIAN
               You know the school comes equipped
               with fire exits at either end of the
               library.

     Brian points at them and Bender glares at him.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               Show Dick some respect!

     Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of
     the library.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               Let's go...go!  Get back into your
               seat.

     Andrew sits.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               I expected a little more from a
               varsity letterman!
                    (to Bender)
               You're not fooling anybody, Bender!
               The next screw that falls out is
               gonna be you!

     Vernon turns to leave.

                            BENDER
                    (under his breath)
               Eat my shorts...

     Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.

                            VERNON
               What was that?

                            BENDER
                    (loudly)
               Eat my shorts!

                            VERNON
               You just bought yourself another
               Saturday, mister!

                            BENDER
               Oh, Christ...

                            VERNON
               You just bought one more right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Well, I'm free the Saturday after
               that...beyond that, I'm gonna have
               to check my calendar!

                            VERNON
               Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled,
               we'll keep goin'!  You want another
               one?  Say the word, just say the
               word!  Instead of going to prison,
               you'll come here!  Are you through.

                            BENDER
               No!

                            VERNON
               I'm doing society a favor!

                            BENDER
               So?

                            VERNON
               That's another one, right now!  I've
               got you for the rest of your natural
               born life if you don't watch your
               step!  You want another one?

                            BENDER
               Yes!

                            VERNON
               You got it!  You got another one,
               right there!  That's another one
               pal!

                            CLAIRE
                    (worried)
               Cut it out!

     Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               Not even close, bud!

                            VERNON
               Good!  You got one more, right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Do you really think I give a shit?

                            VERNON
               Another...

     Bender glares at him.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               How many is that?

                            BRIAN
               That's seven including the one when
               we first came in and you asked Mr.
               Vernon here whether Barry Manilow
               knew that he raided his closet.

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Now it's eight...
                    (to Brian)
               You stay out of it!

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me, sir, it's seven!

                            VERNON
               Shut up, Peewee!
                    (to Bender)
               You're mine Bender...for two months
               I gotcha!  I gotcha!

                            BENDER
               What can I say?  I'm thrilled!

                            VERNON
               Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you
               want these people to believe.  You
               know something, Bender?  You ought
               to spend a little more time trying
               to do something with yourself and a
               little less time trying to impress
               people.  You might be better off.
                    (to everyone)
               Alright, that's it!  I'm going to
               be right outside those doors.  The
               next time I hafta come in here...I'm
               cracking skulls!  (Bender mouths Im
               cracking skulls)

     Vernon leaves and closes the door.  A musical riff
     builds to a climax as Bender screams.

                            BENDER
                    (screams)
               Fuck you!

     We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight.

     We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a
     cigarette with his shoe.

     We see Claire thinking.

     We see Brian playing with his balls.

     We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt.

     We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and
     making it turn purple.

     We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then
     plays air guitar.

     We see Allison drawing.

     We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers
     silently.

     Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.

     We see everyone fall asleep.
                                                  CUT TO:

13. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.

                            VERNON
               Wake up!  Who has to go to the
               lavatory?

     Everyone raises their hands.
                                                  CUT TO:

14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     We see the clock, it now says 10:22.

     We see Andrew stretching.  We see Bender tearing pages
     out of a book.  He is tossing them around.

                            ANDREW
               That's real intelligent.

                            BENDER
               You're right...it's wrong to
               destroy literature...

     He continues to tear pages out.

                            BENDER
               It's such fun to read...and, Molet
               really pumps my nads!

                            CLAIRE
                    (pronouncing it correctly)
               Mol-yare.

                            BRIAN
              I love his work.

     Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian.  He picks
     up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards
     out.

                            BENDER
               Big deal...nothing to do when you're
               locked in a vacancy..

                           ANDREW
               Speak for yourself...

                            BENDER
               Do you think I'd speak for you?  I
               don't even know your language!

     Andrew turns to Claire.

                            ANDREW
               Hey, you grounded tonight?

     Claire shrugs.

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, my mom said I was but
               by dad told me to just blow her off.

                            ANDREW
               Big party at Stubbies, parents are
               in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah, can you go?

                            CLAIRE
               I doubt it...

                            ANDREW
               How come?

                            CLAIRE
               Well 'cause if I do what my mother
               tells me not to do, it's because
               because my father says it's okay.
               There's like this whole big monster
               deal, it's endless and it's a total
               drag.  It's like any minute...
               divorce...

                            BENDER
               Who do you like better?

                            CLAIRE
               What?

                            BENDER
               You like your old man better than
               your mom?

                            CLAIRE
               They're both strict.

                            BENDER
               No, I mean, if you had to choose
               between them.

                            CLAIRE
               I dunno, I'd probably go live with
               my brother.  I mean, I don't think
               either one of them gives a shit
               about me...it's like they use me
               just to get back at each other.

     Suddenly, from the back of the room.  Allison speaks.

                           ALLISON
                    (loudly)
               Ha!!!

     Everyone looks at her shocked.  Allison blows her hair
     out of her eyes and grins.

                            CLAIRE
               Shut up!

                            ANDREW
               You're just feeling sorry for
               yourself...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else
               would.

                            ANDREW
               Aw...you're breaking my heart...

                            BENDER
               Sporto...

                            ANDREW
               What?

     Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.

                            BENDER
               You get along with your parents?

                            ANDREW
               Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,
               right?

                            BENDER
               You're an idiot anyway...But if you
               say you get along with your parents
               well you're a liar too!

     Bender turns and walks away from him.  Andrew follows
     and pushes Bender.

                            ANDREW
               You know something, man...If we
               weren't in school right now, I'd
               waste you!

     Bender points his middle finger at the floor.

                            BENDER
               Can you hear this?  Want me to turn
               it up?

     Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew
     the bird.

     Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's
     shoulders.

                            BRIAN
               Hey fellas, I mean...

     Andrew pushes away from Brian.

                            BRIAN
               ...I don't like my parents either,
               I don't...I don't get along with
               them...their idea of parental
               compassion is just, you know, wacko!

     Bender turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Dork...

                            BRIAN
              Yeah?

                            BENDER
               You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

     Bender starts to walk away.

                            BRIAN
               Well that's a problem!

                            BENDER
               Look, I can see you getting all
               bunged up for them making you wear
               these kinda clothes.  But face it,
               you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!
               What would you be doing if you
               weren't out making yourself a better
               citizen?

                            ANDREW
               Why do you have to insult everybody?

                            BENDER
               I'm being honest, asshole!  I would
               expect you...to know the difference!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah well, he's gotta name!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah,
                    (to Brian)
               What's your name?

                            BRIAN
               Brian...

                            ANDREW
               See...

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               My condolences...

     Bender walks away.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               What's your name?

                            BENDER
               What's yours?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...

                            BENDER
               Ka-Laire?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...it's a family name!

                            BENDER
               Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!

                            CLAIRE
               Well thank you...

                            BENDER
               You're welcome...

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not fat!

                            BENDER
               Well not at present but I could see
               you really pushing maximum density!
               You see, I'm not sure if you know
               this...but there are two kinds of
               fat people.  There's fat people that
               were born to be fat, and then there's
               fat people that were once thin but
               they became fat...so when you look
               at them you can sorta see that thin
               person inside!  You see, you're
               gonna get married, you're gonna
               squeeze out a few puppies and then,
               uh...

     He mimes becoming fat, making noises.

     Claire gives him the finger.

                            BENDER
               Oh...obscene finger gestures from
               such a pristine girl!

                            CLAIRE
                    (resentfully)
               I'm not that pristine!

     Bender bends down closer to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Are you a virgin?
                    (a beat)
               I'll bet you a million dollars that
               you are!  Let's end the suspense!
               Is it gonna be...
                    (another beat)
               ...a white weddin?

                            CLAIRE
               Why don't you just shut up?

                            BENDER
               Have you ever kissed a boy on the
               mouth?
                    (a beat)
               Have you ever been felt up?  Over
               the bra, under the blouse, shoes
               off...hoping to God your parents
               don't walk in?

     Claire is getting upset.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want me to puke?

                            BENDER
               Over the panties, no bra, blouse
               unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on
               the front seat past eleven on a
               school night?

                            ANDREW
               Leave her alone!

     Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.

                            ANDREW
               I said leave her alone!

                            BENDER
               You gonna make me?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

     Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.

                            BENDER
               You and how many of your friends?

                            ANDREW
               Just me, just you and me.  Two hits.
               Me hitting you, you hitting the
               floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal!

     Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on
     the ground with a wrestling move.

                            BENDER
               I don't wanna get into to this with
               you man...

     Andrew gets up.

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

     Bender gets up.

                            BENDER
               'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.
               I'd kill you and your fucking parents
               would sue me and it would be a big
               mess and I don't care enough about
               you to bother.

                            ANDREW
               Chicken shit...

     Andrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a
     switchblade and opens it.

     He stabs the switchblade into a chair.

                            ANDREW
               Let's end this right now.  You don't
               talk to her...you don't look at her
               and you don't even think about her!
               You understand me?

                            BENDER
               I'm trying to help her!.

     We see the janitor, CARL come into the room.

                             CARL
               Brian, how you doing?

                            BENDER
               Your dad works here?

     Brian is embarrassed.

                            BENDER
               Uh, Carl?

                             CARL
               What?

                            BENDER
               Can I ask you a question?

                             CARL
               Sure...

                            BENDER
               How does one become a janitor?

                             CARL
               You wanna be a janitor?

                            BENDER
               No I just wanna know how one becomes
               a janitor because Andrew here, is
               very interested in persuing a
               career in the custodial arts...

                             CARL
               Oh, really?  You guys think I'm
               just some untouchable peasant?  Peon?
               Huh?  Maybe so, but following
               a broom around after shitheads like
               you for the past eight years I've
               learned a couple of things...I look
               through your letters, I look through

               way, that clock's twenty minutes
               fast!

     Everyone groans.  Bender smiles.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

16. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Bender starts to whistle a marching tune and everybody
     joins in.

     Vernon enters.  Bender begins to whistle Beethoven's
     5th.

                            VERNON
               Allright girls, that's thirty
               minutes for lunch...

                            ANDREW
               Here?

                            VERNON
               Here...

                            ANDREW
               Well I think the cafeteria would be
               a more suitable place for us to eat
               lunch in, sir!

                            VERNON
               Well, I don't care what you think,
               Andrew!

                            BENDER
               Uh, Dick?  Excuse me, Rich...will
               milk be made available to us?

                            ANDREW
               We're extremely thirsty sir...

                            CLAIRE
               I have a very low tolerance for
               dehydration.

                            ANDREW
               I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's
               pretty gross.

     Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Relax, I'll get it!

                            VERNON
               Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub!

     Bender grins.

                            VERNON
               What do you think, I was born
               yesterday?  You think I'm gonna
               have you roaming these halls?

     He points at Andrew.

                            VERNON
               You!

     He points at Allison.

                            VERNON
               And you!  Hey!  What's her name?
               Wake her!  Wake her up!
                    (to Allison)
               Come on, on your feet missy!  Let's
               go!  This is no rest home!

     Allison gets up.

                            VERNON
               There's a soft drink machine in the
               teacher's lounge.  Lets go!

     Andrew and Allison are walking in the hall.

                            ANDREW
               So, what's your poison?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               What do you drink?

     Allison still doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Okay...forget I asked...

     Allison waits for two beats and then speaks.

                           ALLISON
               Vodka...

                            ANDREW
               Vodka?  When do you drink vodka?

                           ALLISON
               Whenever...

                            ANDREW
              A lot?

     Allison smiles.

                           ALLISON
               Tons...

                            ANDREW
               Is that why you're here today?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Why are you here?

     Allison snaps back.

                           ALLISON
               Why are you here?

     They stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall.

                            ANDREW
               Um, I'm here today...because uh,
               because my coach and my father don't
               want me to blow my ride.  See I get
               treated differently because uh,
               Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does
               my old man.  I'm not a winner
               because I wanna be one... I'm a
               winner because I got strength and
               speed.  Kinda like a race horse.
               That's about how involved I am in
               what's happening to me.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah?  That's very interesting.
               Now why don't you tell me why you're
               really in here.

                            ANDREW
               Forget it!

17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around
     waiting for the Cokes.

                            BENDER
               Claire...you wanna see a picture of
               a guy with elephantitus of the nuts?
               It's pretty tasty...

                            CLAIRE
               No thank you...

                            BENDER
               How do you think he rides a bike?

     Claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust.

                            BENDER
               Oh, Claire...would you ever consider
               dating a guy like this?

                            CLAIRE
               Can't you just leave me alone?

                            BENDER
               I mean if he had a great personality
               and was a good dancer and had a cool
               car...Although you'd probably have
               to ride in the back seat 'cause his
               nuts would ride shotgun.

                            CLAIRE
               You know what I wish I was doing?

                            BENDER
               Op, watch what you say, Brian here
               is a cherry.

                            BRIAN
               A cherry?

                            CLAIRE
               I wish I was on a plane to France.

                            BRIAN
               I'm not a cherry.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               When have you ever gotten laid?

                            BRIAN
               I've laid, lotsa times!

                            BENDER
               Name one!

                            BRIAN
               She lives in Canada, met her at
               Niagra Falls.  You wouldn't know
               her.

                            BENDER
               Ever laid anyone around here.

     Brian shushes Bender and points at Claire whos back is
     still turned.

                            BRIAN
                    Oh, you and Claire, did it!

     Claire spins around.

                            CLAIRE
              What are you talking about?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               Nothin', nothin!
                    (to Bender)
               Let's just drop it, we'll talk about
               it later!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Drop what, what're you talking
               about?

                            BENDER
               Well, Brian's trying to tell me that
               in addition to the number of girls
               in the Niagra Falls area, that
               presently you and he are, riding
               the hobby horse!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Brian)
               Little pig!

                            BRIAN
               No I'm not!  I'm not!  John said I
               was a cherry and I said I wasn't,
               that's it, that's all that was said!

                            BENDER
               Well then what were you motioning to
               Claire for?

                            CLAIRE
               You know I don't appreciate this
               very much, Brian.

                            BRIAN
               He is lying!

                            BENDER
               Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               You know he's lying, right?

                            BENDER
               Were you or were you not motioning
               to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, but it was only...was only
               because I didn't want her to know
               that I was a virgin, okay?

     Bender just stares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm
               sorry...

     Claire laughs.

                            CLAIRE
               Why didn't you want me to know you
               were a virgin?

                            BRIAN
               Because it's personal business, it's
               my personal, private business.

                            BENDER
               Well Brian, it doesn't sound like
               you're doing any business...

                            CLAIRE
               I think it's okay for a guy to be a
               virgin...

     Bender looks suprised.

                            BRIAN
               You do?

     Claire smiles and nods.

     Later.

     Everybody has lunches now.

     Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.

                            BENDER
               What's in there?

                            CLAIRE
               Guess, where's your lunch?

                            BENDER
               You're wearing it...

                            CLAIRE
               You're nauseating...

     Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
     catches it without even looking up.

     Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.

                            BENDER
               What's that?

                            CLAIRE
               Sushi...

                            BENDER
               Sushi?

                            CLAIRE
               Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed.

                            BENDER
               You won't accept a guys tongue in
               your mouth and you're gonna eat
               that?

                            CLAIRE
               Can I eat?

                            BENDER
               I don't know...give it a try...

     We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his
     bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
     of cookies and a carton of milk.

     Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly
     slurps it up off the table and her fingers.

     Andrew sees Bender looking at him.

                            ANDREW
               What's your problem?

     Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
     It lands on the sculpture above.

     She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the
     sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that.
     She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it.

     Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes
     Brian's bag lunch.

                            BENDER
               What're we having?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, it's your standard, regular
               lunch I guess...

     Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos.  He
     sets it on the table and points at it.

                            BENDER
               Milk?

                            BRIAN
               Soup.

     Bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box.
     Brian reaches toward the bag and Bender slaps his hand.

                            BRIAN
               That's apple juice...

                            BENDER
               I can read!  PB & J with the crusts
               cut off...Well Brian, this is a
               very nutritous lunch, all the food
               groups are represented.  Did your
               mom marry Mr. Rogers?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, no, Mr. Johnson...

                            BENDER
               Ahhh....

     Andrew and Claire smile at each other.  Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Here's my impression of life at big
               Bri's house...
                    (in a loud and friendly voice)
               Son!
                    (in a kiddie voice)
               Yeah Dad?
                    (loud)
               How's your day, pal?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, how's yours?
                    (loud)
               Super, say son, how'd you like to go
               fishing this weekend?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, but I've got homework to
               do!
                    (loud)
               That's alright son, you can do it,
               on the boat!
                    (kiddie)
               Geee!!!
                    (loud)
               Dear, isn't our son swell?
                    (quiet and motherly)
               Yes Dear, isn't life swell?

     Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father
     kissing mother and then father punching mother in the
     face.

     Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.

                            ANDREW
               Alright, what about your family?

                            BENDER
               Oh, mine?

                            ANDREW
               That's real easy!

     Bender stands again and points forward.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Stupid, worthless, no good, God
               damned, freeloading, son of a bitch,
               retarded, bigmouth, know it all,
               asshole, jerk!
                       (as his mother)
               You forgot ugly, lazy and
               disrespectful.

     Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable
     mother.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Shut up bitch!  Go fix me a turkey
               pot pie!
                    (as himself)
               What about you Dad?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself--yelling)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father--yelling)
               Fuck you!

     He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him.

                            BRIAN
               Is that for real?

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               You wanna come over sometime?

                            ANDREW
               That's bullshit.  It's all part of
               your image, I don't believe a word
               of it.

     Bender actually looks hurt.

                     BENDER
               You don't believe me?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BENDER
               No?

                            ANDREW
               Did I stutter?

     Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right
     sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.

                            BENDER
               Do you believe this?  Huh?  It's
               about the size of a cigar...Do I
               stutter?  You see, this is what you
               get in my house when you spill paint
               in the garage.

     Bender begins to walk away.

                            BENDER
               See I don't think that I need to
               sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

     Bender walks over to a map table and throws all the
     maps on the floor.  He climbs up on top of the table and
     then up to the second floor balcony.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               You shouldn't have said that!

                            ANDREW
               How would I know, I mean he lies
               about everything anyway!

19. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to
     pour coffee out of his thermos.  The top comes off and
     the coffee goes all over his desk.

                            VERNON
               Oh, shit!
                                                  CUT TO:

20. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.

                            VERNON
               Coffee...looks like they scrape it
               off the bottom of the Mississippi
               river.  Everything's polluted,
               everything's polluted...the coffee.

     Bender comes out of the library doors followed
     bye veryone else.

     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.
     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the
     end of the line, Allison is following.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               How do you know where Vernon went?

                            BENDER
               I don't...

                            CLAIRE
               Well then, how do you know when he'll
               be back?

                            BENDER
               I don't...being bad feels pretty
               good, huh?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               What's the point in going to Bender's
               locker?

                            ANDREW
               Beats me...

                            BRIAN
               This is so stupid...Why do you think,
               why are we risking getting caught?

                            ANDREW
               I dunno...

                            BRIAN
               So then what are we doing?

                            ANDREW
               You ask me one more question and I'm
               beating the shit out of you!

                            BRIAN
               Sorry...

     Bender opens his locker.

                            ANDREW
               Slob!

                            BENDER
               My maid's on vacation.

     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.

                            BRIAN
               Drugs...

                            ANDREW
              Screw that Bender...put it back!

     Bender walks away.

                         BRIAN
               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.

     Claire walks after Bender.

                            BRIAN
               That was marijuana!

                            ANDREW
               Shut up!

     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison
     who is standing there with her mouth open.

                            BRIAN
               Do you approve of this?

     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of
     Bender's locker.

     We see the crowd walking down the hall.

                            BENDER
               We'll cross through the lab, and
               then we'll double back.

                            ANDREW
               You better be right, if Vernon cuts
               us off it's your fault, asshole!

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               What'd he say?  Where're we going?

     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various
     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon
     until they stop.

                            BENDER
               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We
               have to go through the cafeteria!

                            ANDREW
               No, the activities hall.

                            BENDER
               Hey man, you don't know what you're
               talking about!

                            ANDREW
               No you don't know what you're
               talking about!

     Allison squeaks.

                            ANDREW
               Now we're through listening to you,
               we're going this way.

     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by
     an iron gate.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

                            BENDER
               Great idea Jagoff!

                            ANDREW
               Fuck you!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to
               John?

                            BRIAN
               We're dead!

                            BENDER
               No, just me!

                            BRIAN
               What do you mean?

                            BENDER
               Get back to the library, keep your
               unit on this!

     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's
     underwear.

     Bender runs away singing loudly.  I wanna be an
     airborne ranger...

     We see Vernon hear Bender.

     The rest of them run.

                            VERNON
               That son of a bitch!

     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in
     the gym.

     Bender is going up for a basket.

                            BENDER
               Three...two...one!

     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is
               this?  What are you doing here, what
               is this?

                            BENDER
               Oh, hi!

                            VERNON
               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's
               over!

                            BENDER
               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?

                            VERNON
               Out!

                            BENDER
               I'm thinking of trying out for a
               scholarship.

                            VERNON
               Gimmie the ball, Bender.

     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball
     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.

     They leave.

21. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     The rest of the kids are all sitting back in their
     seats when Bender and Vernon enter.  Vernon pushes Bender.

                            VERNON
               Get your stuff, let's go!
                    (to everyone)
               Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon
               himself to go to the gymnasium.  I'm
               sorry to inform you, you're going to
               be without his services for the rest
               of the day.

                            BENDER
                    (to Vernon)
               B-O-O H-O-O!

                            VERNON
               Everything's a big joke, huh Bender?
               The false alarm you pulled, Friday,
               false alarms are really funny,
               aren't they...What if your home,
               what if your family...
                    (a beat)
               ...what if your dope was on fire?

                            BENDER
               Impossible, sir...It's in Johnson's
               underwear...

     Andrew laughs.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               You think he's funny?  You think
               this is cute?  You think he's
               bitchin', is that it?  Lemme tell
               you something.  Look at him, he's a
               bum.
                    (to everybody)
               You wanna see something funny?  You
               go visit John Bender in five years!
               You'll see how God damned funny he
               is!
                    (to Bender)
               What's the matter, John?  You gonna
               cry?  Let's go...

     Vernon grabs Bender's shoulder.

                            BENDER
               Hey keep your fuckin' hands off me!
               I expect better manners from you,
               Dick!

     Bender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays
     them in front of Andrew.

                            BENDER
               For better hallway vision!

     Bender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the
     way.

21. INT. CLOSET - DAY

     Vernon has put Bender in a closet and is in there
     talking to him.

                            VERNON
               That's the last time, Bender.  That's
               the last time you ever make me look
               bad in front of those kids, do you
               hear me?  I make $31,000 dollars a
               year and I have a home and I'm not
               about to throw it away on some punk
               like you...But someday, man, someday.
               When you're outta here and you've
               forgotten all about this place...
               And they've forgotten all about you
               and you're wrapped up in your own
               pathetic life...I'm gonna be there.
               That's right.  And I'm gonna kick
               the living shit out of you, man, I'm
               gonna knock your dick in the dirt!

                            BENDER
               Are you threatening me?

                            VERNON
               What're you gonna do about it?  You
               think anybody's gonna believe you?
               You think anybody's gonna take your
               word over mine?  I'm a man of
               respect around here.  They love me
               around here, I'm a swell guy...you're
               a lying sack of shit!  And everybody
               knows it.  Oh, you're a real tough
               guy...come on, come on...get on your
               feet, pal!  Let's find out how
               tough you are!  I wanna know right
               now, how tough you are!  Come on!
               I'll give you the first punch, let's
               go!  Come on, right here, just take
               the first shot!  Please, I'm begging
               you, take a shot!  Come on, just
               take one shot, that's all I need,
               just one swing...

     Bender just sits there staring at Vernon.  Vernon fakes
     a punch and Bender flinches.

                            VERNON
               That's what I though...you're a
               gutless turd!

     Vernon leaves and locks the closet door after him.
     Bender climbs into a hatch in the ceiling and
     disappears.

               A naked blond walks into a bar, with
               a poodle under one arm and a two
               foot salami under the other.  She
               lays the poodle on the table.  Bar-
               tender says: "I suppose you won't
               be needing a drink."  The naked
               lady says...

     The ceiling under Bender gives and he falls through.

23. INT. FACILTY BATHROOM - DAY

     We see the door to the bathroom.  We hear Vernon
     inside.

                         VERNON (OS)
               Jesus Christ, allmighty!

24. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Bender walks down the stairs.

                            BENDER
               I forgot my pencil...

     We hear Vernon in the hall.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!  What in God's name is
               going on in here?

     Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
              What was that ruckus?

                            ANDREW
               Uh, what ruckus?

                            VERNON
               I was just in my office and I heard
               a ruckus!

                            BRIAN
               Could you describe the ruckus, sir?

                            VERNON
               Watch your tongue young man, watch
               it!

     We see Bender under the table by Claire's legs.  He
     sits up and bangs his head on the table.  He groans.

     Above the table, Andrew and Claire try to take credit
     for the noise by making more noise.

                            VERNON
               What is that?  What, what is that,
               what is that noise?

     Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and
     can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's
     legs.

                            ANDREW
               What noise?

                            CLAIRE
               Really, sir, there wasn't any noise...

     Claire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her
     knees.

     Everyone starts faking a coughing fit.

                            CLAIRE
                    (flustered)
               That noise?  Was that the noise you
               were talking about?

                            VERNON
               No, it wasn't.  That was not the
               noise I was talking about.  Now, I
               may not have caught you in the act
               this time, but you can bet I will.

     Allison laughs at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               You make book on that missy!
                    (to Claire)
               And you!  I will not be made a fool
               of!

     He turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the
     toilet seat cover stuck to his pants.
     Vernon leaves.

     Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a
     barage of slaps.

                            BENDER
               It was an accident!

                           CLAIRE
               You're an asshole!

                            BENDER
               So sue me...

     Bender gets up and walks over to Brian.

                            BENDER
               So, Ahab...Kybo Mein Doobage...

     Brian gives Bender his bag of marajuana.  Bender turns
     and walks away.

                            ANDREW
               Yo waistoid...you're not gonna blaze
               up in here!

     Claire gets up and goes after him.  Then Brian.

                            ANDREW
               Shit...

     Andrew goes.

26. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Brian, Bender and Claire are sitting in a circle and
     laughing hysterically.

     Bender lights Claire up and she coughs the smoke out.
     Brian laughs at her.  He exhales and tries to eat the
     smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice.

                            BRIAN
               Chicks, cannot hold der smoke!  That's
               what it is!

                            CLAIRE
               Do you know how popular I am?  I'm
               so popular, everybody loves me so
               much, at this school...

                            BENDER
               Poor baby.

     Brian waves Claire over to him and he falls over.

     We see Andrew emerge from a really smokey room.  He
     inhales another puff and then starts dancing to
     everybody's applause.

     He goes back in the room he was in.  He screams and it
     shatters the glass in the door.

27. INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Vernon is glancing through the confidential files in
the
     school basement.

                            VERNON
                    (to himself)
               Mister, oh mister Tearney...a
               history of slight mental illness?
               Wooh, no wonder he's so fucked up!

     Carl enters.

                             CARL
               Afternoon, Dick...

                            VERNON
               Hey Carl, how you doin'?

                             CARL
               Good...

                            VERNON
               Good, what's up?

                             CARL
               Not much, what's happening, what
               are you doing in the basement files?

                            VERNON
               Oh, nothin' nothin' here.  I'm just
               doin' a little homework here...

                             CARL
               Homework, huh?

                            VERNON
               Yeah...

     Carl, laughing, comes over and looks at the files that
     Vernon was looking at.

                             CARL
               Confidential files...hmmm?

                            VERNON
               Look, Carl...this is a highly
               sensitive area and I, I tell you
               something...certain people would be
               very very embarrassed.  I would really
               appreciate it if if if if this would
               be something that, that you and I
               could keep between us...

               What're you gonna do for me, man?

               Well, well what would you like?

                             CARL
               Got fifty bucks?

                            VERNON

28. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Andrew and Brian laughing.  Allison is hanging
     out over by the statue in the back of the library.

                            ANDREW
               No no man, no; you got a middle
               name?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, guess...

     Allison suddenly takes interest in the conversation and
     as she speaks, she moves over and sits next to the two.

                           ALLISON
               Your middle name is Ralph, as in
               puke...

     Brian and Andrew look at her in confusion.

                           ALLISON
               ...your birthday is March 12th,
               you're five-nine and a half you
               weigh a hundred and thirty pounds
               and your social security number is
               0-4-9-3-8-0-9-1
                    (a beat)
               3.

     Andrew is impressed.

                            ANDREW
               Wow!  Are you psychic?

                           ALLISON
               No...

                            BRIAN
               Well would you mind telling me how
               you know all this about me?

     Allison reaches in her bag.

                           ALLISON
               I stole your wallet...

     She produces it in her hands and grins.

                            BRIAN
               Give it to me...

                           ALLISON
               No...

                            BRIAN
               Give it!

     Allison reluctantly hands over the wallet and Brian
     glances through it to make sure nothing is missing.

                            BRIAN
               This is great...you're a thief too!
               Huh?

                           ALLISON
               I'm not a thief!

                            BRIAN
               Multi-talented!

                           ALLISON
               What's there to steal?  Two bucks
               and a beaver shot!

                            ANDREW
               A what?

                          ALLISON
               He's got a nudie picture in there!
               I saw it, it's perverted!

                            ANDREW
               Alright, let's see it!

     We see Bender, he is brushing his teeth with one of
     Claire's cosmetic brushes.

     We see Claire looking through Bender's wallet pictures.

                            CLAIRE
               Are all these your girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               Some of them...

                            CLAIRE
               What about the others?

                            BENDER
               Well, some I consider my girlfriends
               and some...I just consider...

                            CLAIRE
               Consider what?

                            BENDER
               Whether or not, I wanna hang out
               with them...

                            CLAIRE
               You don't believe in just one guy,
               one girl?

                            BENDER
               Do you?

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah...that's the way it should be.

                            BENDER
               Well, not for me...

                            CLAIRE
               Why not?

     Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that.  He acts
     defensive.

                            BENDER
               How come you got so much shit in
               your purse?

                            CLAIRE
               How come you got so many
               girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               I asked you first...

                            CLAIRE
                    (shrugs)
               I dunno...I guess I never throw
               anything away.

                            BENDER
               Neither do I...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh...

     We cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are
     sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet.

                            ANDREW
               This is the worst fake ID I've ever
               seen...

     Brian laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Do you realize you made yourself
               sixty eight?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, I know...I know, I goofed it...

                            ANDREW
               What do you need a fake ID for?

                            BRIAN
                    (like it's obvious)
               So I can vote!

     Allison looks up suddenly.

                           ALLISON
               You wanna see what's in my bag?

                        BRIAN & ANDREW
               No!

     Allison looks hurt and then resentful.  Just to spite
     them, she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch.

     Lots of stuff comes out.

                            ANDREW
               Holy shit!  What is all that stuff?

                            BRIAN
               Do you always carry this much shit
               in your bag?

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...I always carry this much shit
               ...in my bag...You never know when
               you may have to jam...

                            BRIAN
               Are you gonna be like a shopping
               bag lady?  You know like, sit in
               alleyways and like talk to buildings
               and wear men's shoes and that kinda
               thing?

                           ALLISON
               I'll do what I have to do...

                            BRIAN
               Why do you have to do anything?

                           ALLISON
                    (with feeling)
               My home life is un...satisfying...

                            BRIAN
               So you're saying you'd subject
               yourself to the violent dangers of
               the Chicago streets because your
               homelife is unsatisfying?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have to run away and live
               in the street...I can run away and,
               go to the ocean, I can go to the
               country, I can go to the mountains.
               I can go to Israel, Africa,
               Afghanistan...

     Brian looks at her and then moves over to Andrew.

                            BRIAN
               Andy...you wanna get in on this?
               Allison here says, she wants to run
               away, because her home life is
               unsatisfying...

                            ANDREW
               Well everyone's home lives are un-
               satisfying...If it wasn't, people
               would live with there parents
               forever...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, yeah I understand.  But I
               think that her's goes beyond, you
               know, what guys like you and me...
               consider normal unsatisfying...

                           ALLISON
               Nevermind...forget it, everything's
               cool!

     Allison starts putting everything back in her purse.

                            ANDREW
               What's the deal?

                           ALLISON
               No!  There's no deal, Sporto.
               Forget it, leave me alone.

                            ANDREW
               Wait a minute, now you're carrying
               all that crap around in your purse.
               Either you really wanna run away or
               you want people to think you wanna
               run away.

                           ALLISON
               Eat shit!

     Allison gets up and walks away.

                            BRIAN
               The girl is an island, with herself.
               Okay?

     Andrew gets up and goes after her.

                            ANDREW
               Hi, you wanna talk?

                           ALLISON
               No!

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

                           ALLISON
               Go away...

                            ANDREW
               Where do you want me to go?

                           ALLISON
               GO away!

     Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry.

                           ALLISON
               You have problems...

                            ANDREW
               Oh, I have problems?

                           ALLISON
               You do everything everybody ever
               tells you to do, that is a problem!

                            ANDREW
               Okay, fine...but I didn't dump my
               purse out on the couch and invite
               people into my problems...Did I?
               So what's wrong?  What is it?  Is
               is bad?  Real bad?  Parents?

     Allison is silently crying.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...

     Andrew nods.

                            ANDREW
               What do they do to you?

                           ALLISON
              They ignore me...

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...yeah...

     They both are crying silently.

29. INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Vernon and Carl are sitting talking.

                            VERNON
               What did you want to be when you
               were young?

                             CARL
               When I was a kid, I wanted to be
               John Lennon...

                            VERNON
               Carl don't be a goof!  I'm trying
               to make a serious point here...I've
               been teaching, for twenty two years,
               and each year...these kids get more
               and more arrogant.

                             CARL
               Aw bull shit, man.  Come on Vern,
               the kids haven't changed, you have!
               You took a teaching position, 'cause
               you thought it'd be fun, right?
               Thought you could have summer
               vacations off...and then you found
               out it was actually work...and that
               really bummed you out.

                            VERNON
               These kids turned on me...they think
               I'm a big fuckin' joke...

                             CARL
               Come on...listen Vern, if you were
               sixteen, what would you think of
               you, huh?

                            VERNON
               Hey...Carl, you think I give one
               rat's ass what these kids think of
               me?

                             CARL
               Yes I do...

                            VERNON
               You think about this...when you get
               old, these kids; when I get old,
               they're gonna be runnin' the country.

                             CARL
               Yeah?

                            VERNON
               Now this is the thought that wakes
               me up in the middle of the night...
               That when I get older, these kids
               are gonna take care of me...

                             CARL
               I wouldn't count on it!

     Vernon ponders that statement for a moment.

30. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.

                            ANDREW
               What would I do for a million bucks?
               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I
               had to...

                            CLAIRE
               That's boring...

                            ANDREW
               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?

                            CLAIRE
               The idea is to like search your mind
               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,
               would you drive to school naked?

     Andrew laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Um, uh...would I have to get out of
               the car?

                            CLAIRE
               Of course...

                            ANDREW
               In the spring, or winter?

                            CLAIRE
               It doesn't matter...spring...

                            ANDREW
               In front of the school or in back
               of the school?

                            CLAIRE
               Either one...

                            ANDREW
               Yes...

                           ALLISON
               I'd do that!

     They all look at her.

                           ALLISON
               I'll do anything sexual, I don't
               need a million dollars to do it
               either...

                            CLAIRE
               You're lying...

                           ALLISON
               I already have...I've done just
               about everything there is except a
               few things that are illegal...I'm a
               nymphomaniac!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                            CLAIRE
               Lie...

                            BRIAN
               Are your parents aware of this?

                           ALLISON
               The only person I told was my
               shrink...

                            ANDREW
               And what'd he do when you told him?

                           ALLISON
               He nailed me...

                            CLAIRE
               Very nice...

                           ALLISON
               I don't think that from a legal
               standpoint what he did can be
               construed as rape since I paid him.

                            CLAIRE
               He's an adult!

     Allison is relishing this attention.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...he's married too!

     Claire notes her disgust.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you have any idea how completely
               gross that is?

                           ALLISON
               Well, the first few times...

                            CLAIRE
               First few times?  You mean he did it
               more than once?

                           ALLISON
               Sure...

                            CLAIRE
               Are you crazy?

                            BRIAN
               Obviously she's crazy if she's
               screwing her shrink...

                           ALLISON
                    (to Claire)
               Have you ever done it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't even have a psychiatrist...

                           ALLISON
               Have you ever done it with a normal
               person?

                            CLAIRE
               Now, didn't we already cover this?

                            BENDER
               You never answered the question...

                            CLAIRE
               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my
               private life with total strangers.

                           ALLISON
               It's kind of a double-edged sword,
               isn't it?

                            CLAIRE
               A what?

                           ALLISON
               Well, if you say you haven't...
               you're a prude.  If you say you
               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.
               You want to but you can't but when
               you do you wish you didn't, right?

                            CLAIRE
               Wrong...

                           ALLISON
               Or, are you a tease?

                            ANDREW
               She's a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh why don't you just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You're a tease and you know it, all
               girls are teases!

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               She's only a tease if what she does
               gets you hot...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't do anything!

                           ALLISON
               That's why you're a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.

     Allison is suddenly defensive.

                           ALLISON
               I've already told you everything!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep
               around without being in love.  I
               mean don't you want any respect?

                           ALLISON
               I don't screw to get respect...That's
               the difference between you and me...

                            CLAIRE
               Not the only difference, I hope.

                            BENDER
               Face it, you're a tease.

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not a tease!

                            BENDER
               Sure you are!  You said it yourself
               sex is a weapon, you use it to get
               respect!

                            CLAIRE
               No, I never said that, she twisted
               my words around.

                            BENDER
               Oh then what do you use it for?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't use it period!

     Claire is on the verge of tears.

                            BENDER
               Oh, are you medically frigid or is
               it psychological?

                            CLAIRE
               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys
               are putting words into my mouth!

                            BENDER
               Well if you'd just answer the
               question...

                            BRIAN
               Why don't you just answer the
               question?

                            ANDREW
               Be honest...

                            BENDER
               No big deal...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, answer it!

                            ANDREW
               Answer the question, Claire!

                            BENDER
               Talk to us!

                       ANDREW & BRIAN
               Come on, answer the question!

                            BENDER
               It's easy, it's only one question!

     Claire silences all of them by screaming.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screaming)
               No!  I never did it!

     Silence for two beats.

                           ALLISON
               I never did it either, I'm not a
               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive
               liar...

                            CLAIRE
               You are such a bitch!  You did that
               on purpose just to fuck me over!

                           ALLISON
               I would do it though...If you love
               someone it's okay...

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you, you're so
               weird.  You don't say anything all
               day and then when you open your
               mouth...you unload all these
               tremendous lies all over me!

                            ANDREW
               You're just pissed off because she
               got you to admit something you didn't
               want to admit to...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it
               any less bizarre...

                            ANDREW
               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all
               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just
               better at hiding it, that's all.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               How are you bizarre?

     Allison decides to field that question.

                           ALLISON
               He can't think for himself...

                            ANDREW
               She's right...do you guys know what,
               uh, what I did to get in here?  I
               taped Larry Lester's buns together.

     Claire laughs.

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               That was you?

                           ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               Yeah, you know him?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I know him...

                            ANDREW
               Well then you know how hairy he is,
               right?  Well, when they pulled the
               tape off, most of his hair came off
               and some, some skin too...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh my God...

                            ANDREW
               And the bizarre thing is, is that
               I did it for my old man...I
               tortured this poor kid, because I
               wanted him to think that I was cool.
               He's always going off about, you
               know, when he was in school...all
               the wild things he used to do.  And
               I got the feeling that he was
               disappointed that I never cut loose
               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
               sitting in the locker room, and I'm
               taping up my knee.  And Larry's
               undressing a couple lockers down
               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...
               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I
               started thinking about my father,
               and his attitude about weakness.
               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
               jumped on top of him and started
               wailing on him...And my friends,
               they just laughed and cheered me on.
               And afterwards, when I was sittin'
               in Vernon's office, all I could
               think about was Larry's father. And
               Larry havin' to go home and...and
               explain what happened to him.  And
               the humiliation...fucking
               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It
               mustuv been unreal...I mean,
                    (he's crying)
               I mean, how do you apologize for
               something like that?  There's no
               way...it's all because of me and
               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate
               him!  He's like this...he's like
               this mindless machine that I can't
               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
               you've got to be number one!  I
               won't tolerate any losers in this
               family...Your intensity is for shit!
               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a
               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish
               my knee would give...and I wouldn't
               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he
               could forget all about me...

                            BENDER
               I think your old man and my old man
               should get together and go bowling.

     Andrew laughs briefly.

                            BRIAN
               It's like me, you know, with my
               grades...like, when I, when I
               step outside myself kinda, and
               when I, when I look in at myself
               you know?  And I see me and I don't
               like what I see, I really don't.

                            CLAIRE
               What's wrong with you?  Why don't
               you like yourself?

                            BRIAN
               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing
               shop.  See we had this assignment,
               to make this ceramic elephant, and
               um...and we had eight weeks to do
               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was
               like a lamp, and when you pull the
               trunk the light was s'posed to go
               on...my light didn't go on, I got a
               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...
               When I signed up, you know, for the
               course I mean.  I thought I was
               playing it real smart, you know.
               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,
               it'll be such an easy way to
               maintain my grade point average...

                            BENDER
               Why'd you think it'd be easy?

                            BRIAN
               Have you seen some of the dopes that
               take shop?

                            BENDER
               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'
               idiot!

                            BRIAN
               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't
               make a lamp?

                            BENDER
               No, you're a genius because you
               can't make a lamp...

                            BRIAN
               What do you know about Trigonometry?

                            BENDER
               I could care less about
               Trigonometry...

                            BRIAN
               Bender, did you know without
               Trigonometry there'd be no
               engineering?

                            BENDER
               Without lamps, there'd be no light!

                            CLAIRE
              Okay so neither one of you is any
               better than the other one...

     Allison feels left out.

                           ALLISON
               I can write with my toes!  I can
               also eat, brush my teeth...

                            CLAIRE
               With your feet?

                           ALLISON
               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.

                            BRIAN
               I can make spaghetti!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               What can you do?

                            ANDREW
               I can...uh...tape all your buns
               together...

                            BENDER
               I wanna see what Claire can do!

                            CLAIRE
               I can't do anything.

                            BENDER
               Now, everybody can do something...

                            CLAIRE
               There's one thing I can do, no
               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.

                            BENDER
               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean
               that guy's been doing that show for
               thirty years.

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, but you have to swear to God
               you won't laugh...I can't believe
               I'm actually doing this...

     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it
     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.

     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.

      Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.

                            ANDREW
               All right, great!  Where'd you learn
               to do that?

                            CLAIRE
               Camp, seventh grade...

                            BENDER
               That was great, Claire...my image of
               you is totally blown...

                           ALLISON
               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her
               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!

                            BENDER
               Am I laughing?

                            ANDREW
               You fucking prick!

     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his
     words hitting home.

                            BENDER
               What do you care what I think,
               anyway?  I don't even count, right?
               I could disappear forever and it
               wouldn't make any difference...I may
               as well not even exist at this
               school, remember?
                    (he turns to Claire)
               And you...don't like me anyway!

                            CLAIRE
               You know, I have just as many
               feelings as you do and it hurts
               just as much when somebody steps
               all over them!

                            BENDER
               God, you're so pathetic!
                    (furious)
               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare
               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got
               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'
               Rapunzel, right?  School would
               probably fucking shut down if you
               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't
               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.

                            CLAIRE
                    (quietly)
               Shut up...

                            BENDER
               Are those real diamonds, Claire?

                            CLAIRE
                    (angry)
               Shut up!

                    BENDER                       CLAIRE
          I bet they are...did you
          work, for the money               Shut...
          for those earrings?                   Your mouth!

                            BENDER
               Or did your daddy buy those?

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious)
               Shut up!

     Claire starts crying.

                            BENDER
               I bet he bought those for you!  I
               bet those are a Christmas gift!
               Right?  You know what I got for
               Christmas this year?  It was a
               banner fuckin' year at the old
               Bender family!  I got a carton of
               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me
               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"
               Okay, so go home'n cry to your
               daddy, don't cry here, okay?

     There are a few beats.

                            ANDREW
               My God, are we gonna be like our
               parents?

                            CLAIRE
               Not me...ever...

                           ALLISON
               It's unavoidable, it just happens.

                            CLAIRE
               What happens?

                           ALLISON
               When you grow up, your heart dies.

                            BENDER
               Who cares?

     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.

                           ALLISON
               I care...

                            BRIAN
               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I
               know it's kind of a weird time, but
               I was just wondering, um, what is
               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When
               we're all together again?  I mean I
               consider you guys my friends, I'm
               not wrong, am I?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BRIAN
               So, so on Monday...what happens?

                            CLAIRE
               Are we still friends, you mean?
               If we're friends now, that is?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah...

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want the truth?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I want the truth...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't think so...

                           ALLISON
               Well, do you mean all of us or just
               John?

                            CLAIRE
               With all of you...

                            ANDREW
               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!

                            CLAIRE
               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came
               walking up to you in the hall on
               Monday, what would you do?  I mean
               picture this, you're there with all
               the sports.  I know exactly what
               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up
               so your friends wouldn't think you
               really liked him!

                            ANDREW
               No way!

                           ALLISON
               'Kay, what if I came up to you?

                            CLAIRE
               Same exact thing!

                            BENDER
                    (furious and screaming at Claire)
               You are a bitch!

                            CLAIRE
               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,
               that makes me a bitch?

                            BENDER
               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that
               is to do to someone!  And you don't
               got the balls to stand up to your
               friends and tell 'em that you're
               gonna like who you wanna like!

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
               Why don't you take Allison to one of
               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or
               take Brian out to the parking lot at
               lunch to get high?  What about Andy
               for that matter, what about me?
               What would your friends say if we
               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
               doing it with me so they'd forgive
               you for being seen with me.

                            BENDER
                    (furious once again)
               Don't you ever talk about my
               friends!  You don't know any of my
               friends, you don't look at any of my
               friends and you certainly wouldn't
               condescend to speak to any of my
               friends so you just stick to the
               things you know, shopping, nail
               polish, your father's BMW and your
               poor--rich--drunk mother in the
               Carribean!

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious and sobbing)
               Shut up!

                            BENDER
               And as far as being concerned about
               what's gonna happen when you and I
               walk down the hallways at school,
               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never
               gonna happen!  Just bury your head
               in the sand...and wait for your
               fuckin' prom!

                            CLAIRE
               I hate you!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?  Good!

     There is silence until Brian speaks.

                            BRIAN
               Then I assume Allison and I are
               better people than you guys, huh?
               Us weirdos...
                    (to Allison)
               Do you, would you do that to me?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have any friends...

                            BRIAN
               Well if you did?

                           ALLISON
               No...I don't think the kind of
               friends I'd have would mind...

                            BRIAN
               I just wanna tell, each of you,
               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't
               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's
               real shitty...

                            CLAIRE
               Your friends wouldn't mind because
               they look up to us...

     Brian laughs at her.

                            BRIAN
               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're
               so conceited.  You're so, like, full
               of yourself, why are you like that?

                            CLAIRE
                    (crying again)
               I'm not saying that to be conceited!
               I hate it!  I hate having to go
               along with everything my friends say!

                            BRIAN
               Well then why do you do it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, I don't...you don't
               understand..you don't.  You're not
               friends with the same kind of people
               that Andy and I are friends with!
               You know, you just don't understand
               the pressure that they can put on
               you!

     Brian is shocked.

                            BRIAN
               I don't understand what?  You think
               I don't understand pressure, Claire?
               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!

     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.

                            BRIAN
               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?
               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a
               gun in the locker...

                            ANDREW
               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

                            BRIAN
               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk
               on it and the light's s'posed to go
               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,
               I...

                            ANDREW
               What's the gun for Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You brought it up, man!

                            BRIAN
               I can't have an F, I can't have it
               and I know my parents can't have it!
               Even if I aced the rest of the
               semester, I'm still only a B.  And
               everything's ruined for me!

                            CLAIRE
                    (with pity)
               Oh Brian...

     Brian bashes a chair over.

                            BRIAN
               So I considered my options, you
               know?

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Killing yourself is not an
               option!

                            BRIAN
               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I
               don't think so!

                           ALLISON
               It was a hand gun?

                            BRIAN
               No, it was a flare gun, went off
               in my locker.

                            ANDREW
               Really?

     Andrew starts to laugh.

                            BRIAN
               It's not funny...

     They all start to laugh, including Brian.

                            BRIAN
               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was
               destroyed!

                           ALLISON
               You wanna know what I did to get in
               here?  Nothing...I didn't have
               anything better to do.

     Everyone laughs.

                           ALLISON
               You're laughing at me...

                            ANDREW
               No!

     Allison starts to laugh too.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah you are!

     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that
     order on the railing.

                            CLAIRE
               Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah?

                            CLAIRE
               Are you gonna write your paper?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, why?

                            CLAIRE
               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of
               us to write our paper, don't you
               think?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us
               to do...

                            CLAIRE
               True, but I think we'd all kinda
               say the same thing.

                            BRIAN
               You just don't want to write your
               paper...Right?

                            CLAIRE
               True, but, you're the smartest,
               right?

                            BRIAN
                    (with pride)
               Oh, well...

                            CLAIRE
               We trust you...

     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in
     approval.

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

                            BRIAN
               All right, I'll do it...

                            CLAIRE
               Great...

     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Allison)
               Come on...

                           ALLISON
               Where're we going?

                            CLAIRE
               Come on!

     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.

                            CLAIRE
               Don't be afraid.

                           ALLISON
               Don't stick that in my eye!

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not sticking it, just close...
               just go like that...

     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.

                            CLAIRE
               Good...

     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.

                            CLAIRE
               You know you really do look a lot
               better without all that black shit
               on your eyes...

                           ALLISON
               Hey...I like that black shit...

                            CLAIRE
               This looks a lot better...look up.

     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.

     We see Andrew just thinking.

     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still
     putting make-up on Allison.

                           ALLISON
               Please, why're you being so nice to
               me?

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause you're letting me.

     We see Brian begin to write.

     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     Brian staring at her with his mouth open.

     She glares at him.

               You know how you said before, how
               your parents used you to get back
               at each other...wouldn't I be
               outstanding in that capacity?

               Saturday in detention for whatever
               it was we did wrong.  But we think

     We see Bender walking across the football field
     as he thrusts his fist into the air in a silent cheer
     and freezes there.

1. EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     During Brian's monologue, we see various views of things
     inside the school including Bender's locker.

                          BRIAN (VO)
               Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer
               High School, Shermer, Illinois.
               60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
               the fact that we had to sacrifice a
               whole Saturday in detention for
               whatever it was that we did wrong,
               what we did was wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make us write this
               essay telling you who we think we
               are, what do you care?  You see us
               as you want to see us...in the
               simplest terms and the most
               convenient definitions.  You see us
               as a brain, an athelete, a basket
               case, a princess and a criminal.
               Correct?  That's the way we saw each
               other at seven o'clock this morning.
               We were brainwashed...

2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY

     We see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the
     parking lot.

     Claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob.

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you can't get me
               out of this...I mean it's so absurd
               I have to be here on a Saturday!
               It's not like I'm a defective or
               anything...

                       CLAIRE'S FATHER
               I'll make it up to you...Honey,
               ditching class to go shopping
               doesn't make you a defective.  Have
               a good day.

     Claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks
     up the school front steps
                                                  CUT TO:

3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY

     We are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is
     his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Is this the first time or the last
               time we do this?

                            BRIAN
                    (upset)
               Last...

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well get in there and use the time
               to your advantage...

                            BRIAN
               Mom, we're not supposed to study; we
               just have to sit there and do
               nothing.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well mister you figure out a way to
               study.

                    BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER
                    (annoyingly)
               Yeah!

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well go!

     Brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school.

4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY

     We see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock;
     hes wearing a lettermans jacket with lots of patches on it.

                       ANDREW'S FATHER
               Hey, I screwed around...guys screw
               around, there's nothing wrong with
               that.  Except you got caught, Sport.

                            ANDREW
               Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?

                       ANDREW'S FATHER
                    (angry)
               You wanna miss a match?  You wanna
               blow your ride?  Now no school's
               gonna give a scholarship to a
               discipline case.

     Andrew gets out of the car and walks into the school.

5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAY

     We see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing
     sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't
     stop walking.

     The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.

     Bender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps
     ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps
     forward to look in the car's front window and the car
     drives away.
                                                 CUT TO:

6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     There are six tables in two rows of three.
     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in
     and sits at the table behind her.

     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.

     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
     desk and takes a few things in the process.

     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian
     reluctantly gets up and moves.

     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
     feet up.

     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the
     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
     Brian.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.

     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.

     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack
     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with
     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
     job.

                            VERNON
               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want
               to congradulate you for being on
               time...

     Claire raises her hand.

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's
               been a mistake.  I know it's
               detention, but...um...I don't think
               I belong in here...

     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.

                            VERNON
               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have
               exactly eight hours and fifty-four
               minutes to think about why you're
               here.  To ponder the error of your
               ways...

     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
     mouth again.

     Claire looks like she is going to gag.

                            VERNON
               ...and you may not talk.  You will
               not move from these seats.

     He glances up at Bender and points at him.

                            VERNON
               ...and you...

     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.

                            VERNON
               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,
               we're gonna try something a little
               different today.  We are going to
               write an essay--of no less than a
               thousand words--describing to me
               who you think you are.

                            BENDER
               Is this a test?

     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
     of Bender.

                            VERNON
               And when I say essay...I mean essay.
               I do not mean a single word repeated
               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.
               Bender?

     Bender looks up.

                            BENDER
               Crystal...

                            VERNON
               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little
               something about yourself.  Maybe
               you'll even--decide whether or not
               you care to return.

     Brian raises his hand and then stands.

                            BRIAN
               You know, I can answer that right
               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
               'cause...

                            VERNON
               Sit down Johnson...

                            BRIAN
               Thank you sir...

     He sits.

                            VERNON
               My office...

     Vernon points.

                            VERNON
               ...is right across that hall.  Any
               monkey business is ill-advised...

     He looks around at them.

                            VERNON
               ...any questions?

                            BENDER
               Yeah...I got a question.

     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.

                            BENDER
               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his
               wardrobe?

                            VERNON
               I'll give you the answer to that
               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
               Don't mess with the bull young man,
               you'll get the horns.

     Vernon leaves.

                            BENDER
               That man...is a brownie hound...

     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is
     Allison, biting her nails.

     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is
     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.

                            BENDER
               You keep eating your hand and you're
               not gonna be hungry for lunch...

     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.

                            BENDER
               I've seen you before, you know...

     We see Vernon look out from his office.

     We see Brian playing with his pen.

                            BRIAN
                    (quietly to himself)
               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?
               Who are you?

     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
     under his upper lip.

                            BRIAN
               I am a walrus...

     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices
     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
     embarrassed.

     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing
     his jacket.

     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands
     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket
     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still
     staring at him.

                            BRIAN
               It's the shits, huh?

     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
     laugh.

     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He
     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's
     head.

     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
     Bender.

     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
     song.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to herself)
               I can't believe this is really
               happening to me...

     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.

                            BENDER
               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do
               if we hafta take a piss?

                            CLAIRE
                    (disgusted)
               Please...

                            BENDER
               If you gotta go...

     We hear Bender unzip his fly.

                            BENDER
               You gotta go!

     Everyone is now looking at Bender.

                            CLAIRE
                   (disgusted)
               Oh my God!

                            ANDREW
               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!

                            BENDER
               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes
               it crawl back up!

                            ANDREW
               You whip it out and you're dead
               before the first drop hits the
               floor!

     Bender gasps mockingly.

                            BENDER
               You're pretty sexy when you get
               angry...grrr!

     He turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Hey, homeboy...

     Brian points at himself with his pen.

                            BENDER
              ...why don't you go close that door.
               We'll get the prom queen--
               impregnated!

     Claire turns and glares at him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!

     Bender ignores him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!
                          BENDER
               What?

                            ANDREW
               If I lose my temper, you're totalled
               man!

                            BENDER
               Totally?

                            ANDREW
               Totally!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody
               here is interested!

                            ANDREW
               Really!
                    (to Claire about Bender)
               Buttface!

                            BENDER
               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to
               get in here?  Forget to wash your
               jock?

                            BRIAN
                    (nervous)
               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we
               should just write our papers...

                            ANDREW
                    (to Bender)
               Look, just because you live in here
               doesn't give you the right to be a
               pain in the ass...so knock it off!

     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.

                            BENDER
               It's a free country...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               He's just doing it to get a rise out
               of you!  Just ignore him...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if
               you tried!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                           BENDER
               So...so!
                    (to Andrew and Claire)
               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-
               friend?
                    (a beat)
               Steady dates?
                    (another beat)
               Lo--vers?
                    (another beat)
               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do
               you slip her the hot...beef...
               injection?

     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screams)
               Go to hell!

                            ANDREW
                    (screams)
               Enough!

                                                  CUT TO:

7. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     We see Vernon in his office.

                            VERNON
                    (yells)
               Hey!  What's going on in there?
                    (to himself)
               Smug little pricks!
                                                  CUT TO:

8. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from
     Bender.

                            ANDREW
                    (to himself)
               Scumbag!

     Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits
     on it.

                            BENDER
               What do you say we close that door.
               We can't have any kind of party
               with Vernon checking us out every
               few seconds.

                            BRIAN
               Well, you know the door's s'posed to
               stay open...

                           BENDER
               So what?

                           ANDREW
               So why don't you just shut up!
               There's four other people in here
               you know...

                            BENDER
               God, you can count.  See!  I knew
               you had to be smart to be a...a
               wrestler.

                            ANDREW
               Who the hell are you to judge
               anybody anyway?

                            CLAIRE
               Really...

                            ANDREW
               You know, Bender...you don't even
               count.  I mean if you disappeared
               forever it wouldn't make any
               difference.  You may as well not
               even exist at this school.

     Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
     before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out,
     however.

                            BENDER
               Well...I'll just run right out and
               join the wrestling team.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
     Bender.

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Maybe the prep club too!  Student
               council...

                            ANDREW
               No, they wouldn't take you.

                            BENDER
               I'm hurt.

                            CLAIRE
               You know why guys like you knock
               everything...

                            BENDER
                    (to himself)
               Oh, this should be stunning...

                            CLAIRE
               It's 'cause you're afraid.

                            BENDER
                    (with mock enthusiasm)
               Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart,
               that's exactly why I'm not heavy in
               activities!

                            CLAIRE
               You're a big coward!

     Brian feels left out.

                            BRIAN
                    (to no one imparticular)
               I'm in the math club...

                            CLAIRE
               See you're afraid that they won't
               take you.  You don't belong so you
               just have to dump all over it...

                            BENDER
               Well...it wouldn't have anything to
               do with you activities people being
               assholes...now would it?

                            CLAIRE
               Well you wouldn't know...You don't
               even know any of us.

                            BENDER
               Well, I don't know any lepers
               either, but I'm not gonna run out
               and join one of their fucking clubs.

                            ANDREW
               Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?

     Brian again feels he needs to contribute.

                            BRIAN
               I'm in the physics club too...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               S'cuse me a sec...
                    (to Brian)
               What are you babbling about?

                            BRIAN
               Well, what I said was...I'm in the
               math club, the Latin club and the
               physics club...physics club.

     Bender nods and turns to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the
               physics club?

                            CLAIRE
               That's an academic club...

                            BENDER
               So?

                            CLAIRE
               So...academic clubs aren't the same
               as other kinds of clubs.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but to dorks like him...

     Bender points at Brian.

                            BENDER
               ...they are.
                    (to Brian)
               What do you guys do in your club?

                            BRIAN
               In physics, um, we ah, we talk about
               physics...about properties of physics.

                            BENDER
               So it's sorta social...demented and
               sad, but social.  Right?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, well, I guess you could
               consider it a social situation.  I
               mean there are other children in my
               club and uh, at the end of the year
               we have, um, you know, a big
               banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.

                            BENDER
               You load up, you party...

                            BRIAN
               Well, no, we get dressed up...I
               mean, but, we don't...we don't get
               high.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Only burners like you get high...

                            BRIAN
               And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
               So I had to borrow my dad's.  It
               was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
               like me to wear other people's
               shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my
               cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
               He got high once and you know, he
               started eating like really weird
               foods.  And uh, and then he just
               felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
               You know, kinda like, you know
               "Twilight Zone" kinda.

                            CLAIRE
                    (laughs)
                    (to Bender)
               Sounds like you...

                            ANDREW
               Look, you guys keep up your talking
               and Vernon's gonna come right in
               here...I got a meet this Saturday
               and I'm not gonna miss it on account
               of you boneheads...

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

     Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.

                            BENDER
               Missing a whole wrestling meet!

                            ANDREW
               Well you wouldn't know anything
               about it, faggot!  You never competed
               in your whole life!

                            BENDER
                    (with mock hurt)
               Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
               because of it.  I have such a deep
               admiration for guys that roll around
               on the floor with other guys!

                            ANDREW
               Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You
               don't have any goals.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but I do!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah?

                            BENDER
               I wanna be just--like--you!  I
               figure all I need's a labotamy and
               some tights!

     Brian becomes interested.

                            BRIAN
               You wear tights?

                            ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               No I don't wear tights, I wear the
               required uniform...

                            BRIAN
               Tights...

                            ANDREW
                    (defensive)
               Shut up!

     They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
     quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
     Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table.
     Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and
     gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors
     that separate the library from the hallway.

                            BRIAN
               You know there's not s'posed to be
               any monkey business!

     Bender turns and points at Brian.

                            BENDER
                    (in a stern voice)
               Young man...have you finished your
               paper?

     Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks
     around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.

                            CLAIRE
               What are you gonna do?

                            ANDREW
               Drop dead, I hope!
                                                  CUT TO:

9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands
     up and checks the way he looks in a mirror.  He does a
     muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish Cobadonga!
                                                  CUT TO:

10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Brian looks up.  Bender is messing with the door to the
     library.

                            BRIAN
               Bender, that's, that's school
               property there...you know, it doesn't
               belong to us.  It's something not to
               be toyed with.

     The door slams shut.  Bender runs back to his seat.

                            ANDREW
               That's very funny, come on, fix it!

                            BRIAN
               You should really fix that!

                            BENDER
               Am I a genius?

                            ANDREW
               No, you're an asshole!

                            BENDER
               What a funny guy!

                            ANDREW
               Fix the door Bender!

                            BENDER
               Everyone just shhh!
                                                  CUT TO:

11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon walking back to his office.  He stops and
     listens to them through the closed door.

                         BENDER (OS)
               I've been here before, I know what
               I'm doing!

                         ANDREW (OS)
               No!  Fix the door, get up there and
               fix it!

                         BENDER (OS)
                    (screams)
               Shut up!
                                                  CUT TO:

12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     He opens the door and storms in.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

     For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare
     at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

                            BENDER
               How're we s'posed to know?  We're
               not s'posed to move, right?

     Vernon turns to Claire.

                            VERNON
               Why?

                            CLAIRE
               We were just sitting here, like we
               were s'posed to...

     Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.

                            VERNON
               Who closed that door?

                            BENDER
               I think a screw fell out of it...

                            ANDREW
               It just closed, sir...

     Vernon looks at Allison in the back.

                            VERNON
               Who?

     Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the
     table, hiding in her jacket hood.

                            BENDER
               She doesn't talk, sir...

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Give me that screw...

                            BENDER
              I don't have it...

                            VERNON
               You want me to yank you outta that
               seat and shake it out of you?

                            BENDER
               I don't have it...screws fall out
               all of the time, the world's an
               imperfect place...

                            VERNON
               Give it to me, Bender...

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir, why would anybody
               want to steal a screw?

                            VERNON
                    (to Claire)
               Watch it, young lady...

     Vernon goes over to the door.  He tries to hold it open
     by putting a folding chair in front of it.

                            BENDER
               The door's way too heavy, sir.

     The door slams shut despite the chair.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     They laugh.

     Vernon opens the door again.  He comes back in.

                            VERNON
                    (pointing)
               Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on,
               front and center, let's go.

     Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon.

                            BENDER
               Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
               If he gets up, we'll all get up,
               it'll be anarchy!

     Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel
     magazine rack in front of the door.

                            VERNON
              Okay, now, watch the magazines!

                            BENDER
               It's out of my hands...

     They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire
     door.

                            BENDER
               That's very clever sir, but what if
               there's a fire?  I think violating
               fire codes and endangering the
               lives of children would be unwise
               at this juncture in your career, sir.

     Vernon thinks about it.  He turns to Andrew.

                            VERNON
               Alright, what are you doing with
               this?  Get this outta here for God's
               sake!  What's the matter with you?
               Come on!

                            BRIAN
               You know the school comes equipped
               with fire exits at either end of the
               library.

     Brian points at them and Bender glares at him.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               Show Dick some respect!

     Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of
     the library.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               Let's go...go!  Get back into your
               seat.

     Andrew sits.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               I expected a little more from a
               varsity letterman!
                    (to Bender)
               You're not fooling anybody, Bender!
               The next screw that falls out is
               gonna be you!

     Vernon turns to leave.

                            BENDER
                    (under his breath)
               Eat my shorts...

     Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.

                            VERNON
               What was that?

                            BENDER
                    (loudly)
               Eat my shorts!

                            VERNON
               You just bought yourself another
               Saturday, mister!

                            BENDER
               Oh, Christ...

                            VERNON
               You just bought one more right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Well, I'm free the Saturday after
               that...beyond that, I'm gonna have
               to check my calendar!

                            VERNON
               Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled,
               we'll keep goin'!  You want another
               one?  Say the word, just say the
               word!  Instead of going to prison,
               you'll come here!  Are you through.

                            BENDER
               No!

                            VERNON
               I'm doing society a favor!

                            BENDER
               So?

                            VERNON
               That's another one, right now!  I've
               got you for the rest of your natural
               born life if you don't watch your
               step!  You want another one?

                            BENDER
               Yes!

                            VERNON
               You got it!  You got another one,
               right there!  That's another one
               pal!

                            CLAIRE
                    (worried)
               Cut it out!

     Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               Not even close, bud!

                            VERNON
               Good!  You got one more, right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Do you really think I give a shit?

                            VERNON
               Another...

     Bender glares at him.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               How many is that?

                            BRIAN
               That's seven including the one when
               we first came in and you asked Mr.
               Vernon here whether Barry Manilow
               knew that he raided his closet.

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Now it's eight...
                    (to Brian)
               You stay out of it!

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me, sir, it's seven!

                            VERNON
               Shut up, Peewee!
                    (to Bender)
               You're mine Bender...for two months
               I gotcha!  I gotcha!

                            BENDER
               What can I say?  I'm thrilled!

                            VERNON
               Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you
               want these people to believe.  You
               know something, Bender?  You ought
               to spend a little more time trying
               to do something with yourself and a
               little less time trying to impress
               people.  You might be better off.
                    (to everyone)
               Alright, that's it!  I'm going to
               be right outside those doors.  The
               next time I hafta come in here...I'm
               cracking skulls!  (Bender mouths Im
               cracking skulls)

     Vernon leaves and closes the door.  A musical riff
     builds to a climax as Bender screams.

                            BENDER
                    (screams)
               Fuck you!

     We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight.

     We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a
     cigarette with his shoe.

     We see Claire thinking.

     We see Brian playing with his balls.

     We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt.

     We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and
     making it turn purple.

     We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then
     plays air guitar.

     We see Allison drawing.

     We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers
     silently.

     Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.

     We see everyone fall asleep.
                                                  CUT TO:

13. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.

                            VERNON
               Wake up!  Who has to go to the
               lavatory?

     Everyone raises their hands.
                                                  CUT TO:

14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     We see the clock, it now says 10:22.

     We see Andrew stretching.  We see Bender tearing pages
     out of a book.  He is tossing them around.

                            ANDREW
               That's real intelligent.

                            BENDER
               You're right...it's wrong to
               destroy literature...

     He continues to tear pages out.

                            BENDER
               It's such fun to read...and, Molet
               really pumps my nads!

                            CLAIRE
                    (pronouncing it correctly)
               Mol-yare.

                            BRIAN
              I love his work.

     Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian.  He picks
     up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards
     out.

                            BENDER
               Big deal...nothing to do when you're
               locked in a vacancy..

                           ANDREW
               Speak for yourself...

                            BENDER
               Do you think I'd speak for you?  I
               don't even know your language!

     Andrew turns to Claire.

                            ANDREW
               Hey, you grounded tonight?

     Claire shrugs.

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, my mom said I was but
               by dad told me to just blow her off.

                            ANDREW
               Big party at Stubbies, parents are
               in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah, can you go?

                            CLAIRE
               I doubt it...

                            ANDREW
               How come?

                            CLAIRE
               Well 'cause if I do what my mother
               tells me not to do, it's because
               because my father says it's okay.
               There's like this whole big monster
               deal, it's endless and it's a total
               drag.  It's like any minute...
               divorce...

                            BENDER
               Who do you like better?

                            CLAIRE
               What?

                            BENDER
               You like your old man better than
               your mom?

                            CLAIRE
               They're both strict.

                            BENDER
               No, I mean, if you had to choose
               between them.

                            CLAIRE
               I dunno, I'd probably go live with
               my brother.  I mean, I don't think
               either one of them gives a shit
               about me...it's like they use me
               just to get back at each other.

     Suddenly, from the back of the room.  Allison speaks.

                           ALLISON
                    (loudly)
               Ha!!!

     Everyone looks at her shocked.  Allison blows her hair
     out of her eyes and grins.

                            CLAIRE
               Shut up!

                            ANDREW
               You're just feeling sorry for
               yourself...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else
               would.

                            ANDREW
               Aw...you're breaking my heart...

                            BENDER
               Sporto...

                            ANDREW
               What?

     Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.

                            BENDER
               You get along with your parents?

                            ANDREW
               Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,
               right?

                            BENDER
               You're an idiot anyway...But if you
               say you get along with your parents
               well you're a liar too!

     Bender turns and walks away from him.  Andrew follows
     and pushes Bender.

                            ANDREW
               You know something, man...If we
               weren't in school right now, I'd
               waste you!

     Bender points his middle finger at the floor.

                            BENDER
               Can you hear this?  Want me to turn
               it up?

     Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew
     the bird.

     Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's
     shoulders.

                            BRIAN
               Hey fellas, I mean...

     Andrew pushes away from Brian.

                            BRIAN
               ...I don't like my parents either,
               I don't...I don't get along with
               them...their idea of parental
               compassion is just, you know, wacko!

     Bender turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Dork...

                            BRIAN
              Yeah?

                            BENDER
               You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

     Bender starts to walk away.

                            BRIAN
               Well that's a problem!

                            BENDER
               Look, I can see you getting all
               bunged up for them making you wear
               these kinda clothes.  But face it,
               you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!
               What would you be doing if you
               weren't out making yourself a better
               citizen?

                            ANDREW
               Why do you have to insult everybody?

                            BENDER
               I'm being honest, asshole!  I would
               expect you...to know the difference!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah well, he's gotta name!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah,
                    (to Brian)
               What's your name?

                            BRIAN
               Brian...

                            ANDREW
               See...

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               My condolences...

     Bender walks away.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               What's your name?

                            BENDER
               What's yours?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...

                            BENDER
               Ka-Laire?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...it's a family name!

                            BENDER
               Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!

                            CLAIRE
               Well thank you...

                            BENDER
               You're welcome...

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not fat!

                            BENDER
               Well not at present but I could see
               you really pushing maximum density!
               You see, I'm not sure if you know
               this...but there are two kinds of
               fat people.  There's fat people that
               were born to be fat, and then there's
               fat people that were once thin but
               they became fat...so when you look
               at them you can sorta see that thin
               person inside!  You see, you're
               gonna get married, you're gonna
               squeeze out a few puppies and then,
               uh...

     He mimes becoming fat, making noises.

     Claire gives him the finger.

                            BENDER
               Oh...obscene finger gestures from
               such a pristine girl!

                            CLAIRE
                    (resentfully)
               I'm not that pristine!

     Bender bends down closer to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Are you a virgin?
                    (a beat)
               I'll bet you a million dollars that
               you are!  Let's end the suspense!
               Is it gonna be...
                    (another beat)
               ...a white weddin?

                            CLAIRE
               Why don't you just shut up?

                            BENDER
               Have you ever kissed a boy on the
               mouth?
                    (a beat)
               Have you ever been felt up?  Over
               the bra, under the blouse, shoes
               off...hoping to God your parents
               don't walk in?

     Claire is getting upset.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want me to puke?

                            BENDER
               Over the panties, no bra, blouse
               unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on
               the front seat past eleven on a
               school night?

                            ANDREW
               Leave her alone!

     Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.

                            ANDREW
               I said leave her alone!

                            BENDER
               You gonna make me?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

     Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.

                            BENDER
               You and how many of your friends?

                            ANDREW
               Just me, just you and me.  Two hits.
               Me hitting you, you hitting the
               floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal!

     Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on
     the ground with a wrestling move.

                            BENDER
               I don't wanna get into to this with
               you man...

     Andrew gets up.

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

     Bender gets up.

                            BENDER
               'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.
               I'd kill you and your fucking parents
               would sue me and it would be a big
               mess and I don't care enough about
               you to bother.

                            ANDREW
               Chicken shit...

     Andrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a
     switchblade and opens it.

     He stabs the switchblade into a chair.

                            ANDREW
               Let's end this right now.  You don't
               talk to her...you don't look at her
               and you don't even think about her!
               You understand me?

                            BENDER
               I'm trying to help her!.

     We see the janitor, CARL come into the room.

                             CARL
               Brian, how you doing?

                            BENDER
               Your dad works here?

     Brian is embarrassed.

                            BENDER
               Uh, Carl?

                             CARL
               What?

                            BENDER
               Can I ask you a question?

                             CARL
               Sure...

                            BENDER
               How does one become a janitor?

                             CARL
               You wanna be a janitor?

                            BENDER
               No I just wanna know how one becomes
               a janitor because Andrew here, is
               very interested in persuing a
               career in the custodial arts...

                             CARL
               Oh, really?  You guys think I'm
               just some untouchable peasant?  Peon?
               Huh?  Maybe so, but following
               a broom around after shitheads like
               you for the past eight years I've
               learned a couple of things...I look
               through your letters, I look through
               your lockers...I listen to your
               conversations, you don't know that
               but I do...I am the eyes and ears of
               this institution my friends.  By the
               way, that clock's twenty minutes
               fast!

     Everyone groans.  Bender smiles.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

16. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Bender starts to whistle a marching tune and everybody
     joins in.

     Vernon enters.  Bender begins to whistle Beethoven's
     5th.

                            VERNON
               Allright girls, that's thirty
               minutes for lunch...

                            ANDREW
               Here?

                            VERNON
               Here...

                            ANDREW
               Well I think the cafeteria would be
               a more suitable place for us to eat
               lunch in, sir!

                            VERNON
               Well, I don't care what you think,
               Andrew!

                            BENDER
               Uh, Dick?  Excuse me, Rich...will
               milk be made available to us?

                            ANDREW
               We're extremely thirsty sir...

                            CLAIRE
               I have a very low tolerance for
               dehydration.

                            ANDREW
               I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's
               pretty gross.

     Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Relax, I'll get it!

                            VERNON
               Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub!

     Bender grins.

                            VERNON
               What do you think, I was born
               yesterday?  You think I'm gonna
               have you roaming these halls?

     He points at Andrew.

                            VERNON
               You!

     He points at Allison.

                            VERNON
               And you!  Hey!  What's her name?
               Wake her!  Wake her up!
                    (to Allison)
               Come on, on your feet missy!  Let's
               go!  This is no rest home!

     Allison gets up.

                            VERNON
               There's a soft drink machine in the
               teacher's lounge.  Lets go!

16. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Andrew and Allison are walking in the hall.

                            ANDREW
               So, what's your poison?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               What do you drink?

     Allison still doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Okay...forget I asked...

     Allison waits for two beats and then speaks.

                           ALLISON
               Vodka...

                            ANDREW
               Vodka?  When do you drink vodka?

                           ALLISON
               Whenever...

                            ANDREW
              A lot?

     Allison smiles.

                           ALLISON
               Tons...

                            ANDREW
               Is that why you're here today?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Why are you here?

     Allison snaps back.

                           ALLISON
               Why are you here?

     They stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall.

                            ANDREW
               Um, I'm here today...because uh,
               because my coach and my father don't
               want me to blow my ride.  See I get
               treated differently because uh,
               Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does
               my old man.  I'm not a winner
               because I wanna be one... I'm a
               winner because I got strength and
               speed.  Kinda like a race horse.
               That's about how involved I am in
               what's happening to me.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah?  That's very interesting.
               Now why don't you tell me why you're
               really in here.

                            ANDREW
               Forget it!

17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around
     waiting for the Cokes.

                            BENDER
               Claire...you wanna see a picture of
               a guy with elephantitus of the nuts?
               It's pretty tasty...

                            CLAIRE
               No thank you...

                            BENDER
               How do you think he rides a bike?

     Claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust.

                            BENDER
               Oh, Claire...would you ever consider
               dating a guy like this?

                            CLAIRE
               Can't you just leave me alone?

                            BENDER
               I mean if he had a great personality
               and was a good dancer and had a cool
               car...Although you'd probably have
               to ride in the back seat 'cause his
               nuts would ride shotgun.

                            CLAIRE
               You know what I wish I was doing?

                            BENDER
               Op, watch what you say, Brian here
               is a cherry.

                            BRIAN
               A cherry?

                            CLAIRE
               I wish I was on a plane to France.

                            BRIAN
               I'm not a cherry.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               When have you ever gotten laid?

                            BRIAN
               I've laid, lotsa times!

                            BENDER
               Name one!

                            BRIAN
               She lives in Canada, met her at
               Niagra Falls.  You wouldn't know
               her.

                            BENDER
               Ever laid anyone around here.

     Brian shushes Bender and points at Claire whos back is
     still turned.

                            BRIAN
                    Oh, you and Claire, did it!

     Claire spins around.

                            CLAIRE
              What are you talking about?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               Nothin', nothin!
                    (to Bender)
               Let's just drop it, we'll talk about
               it later!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Drop what, what're you talking
               about?

                            BENDER
               Well, Brian's trying to tell me that
               in addition to the number of girls
               in the Niagra Falls area, that
               presently you and he are, riding
               the hobby horse!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Brian)
               Little pig!

                            BRIAN
               No I'm not!  I'm not!  John said I
               was a cherry and I said I wasn't,
               that's it, that's all that was said!

                            BENDER
               Well then what were you motioning to
               Claire for?

                            CLAIRE
               You know I don't appreciate this
               very much, Brian.

                            BRIAN
               He is lying!

                            BENDER
               Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               You know he's lying, right?

                            BENDER
               Were you or were you not motioning
               to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, but it was only...was only
               because I didn't want her to know
               that I was a virgin, okay?

     Bender just stares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm
               sorry...

     Claire laughs.

                            CLAIRE
               Why didn't you want me to know you
               were a virgin?

                            BRIAN
               Because it's personal business, it's
               my personal, private business.

                            BENDER
               Well Brian, it doesn't sound like
               you're doing any business...

                            CLAIRE
               I think it's okay for a guy to be a
               virgin...

     Bender looks suprised.

                            BRIAN
               You do?

     Claire smiles and nods.
                                                  CUT TO:

18.  INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     Everybody has lunches now.

     Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.

                            BENDER
               What's in there?

                            CLAIRE
               Guess, where's your lunch?

                            BENDER
               You're wearing it...

                            CLAIRE
               You're nauseating...

     Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
     catches it without even looking up.

     Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.

                            BENDER
               What's that?

                            CLAIRE
               Sushi...

                            BENDER
               Sushi?

                            CLAIRE
               Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed.

                            BENDER
               You won't accept a guys tongue in
               your mouth and you're gonna eat
               that?

                            CLAIRE
               Can I eat?

                            BENDER
               I don't know...give it a try...

     We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his
     bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
     of cookies and a carton of milk.

     Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly
     slurps it up off the table and her fingers.

     Andrew sees Bender looking at him.

                            ANDREW
               What's your problem?

     Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
     It lands on the sculpture above.

     She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the
     sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that.
     She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it.

     Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes
     Brian's bag lunch.

                            BENDER
               What're we having?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, it's your standard, regular
               lunch I guess...

     Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos.  He
     sets it on the table and points at it.

                            BENDER
               Milk?

                            BRIAN
               Soup.

     Bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box.
     Brian reaches toward the bag and Bender slaps his hand.

                            BRIAN
               That's apple juice...

                            BENDER
               I can read!  PB & J with the crusts
               cut off...Well Brian, this is a
               very nutritous lunch, all the food
               groups are represented.  Did your
               mom marry Mr. Rogers?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, no, Mr. Johnson...

                            BENDER
               Ahhh....

     Andrew and Claire smile at each other.  Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Here's my impression of life at big
               Bri's house...
                    (in a loud and friendly voice)
               Son!
                    (in a kiddie voice)
               Yeah Dad?
                    (loud)
               How's your day, pal?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, how's yours?
                    (loud)
               Super, say son, how'd you like to go
               fishing this weekend?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, but I've got homework to
               do!
                    (loud)
               That's alright son, you can do it,
               on the boat!
                    (kiddie)
               Geee!!!
                    (loud)
               Dear, isn't our son swell?
                    (quiet and motherly)
               Yes Dear, isn't life swell?

     Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father
     kissing mother and then father punching mother in the
     face.

     Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.

                            ANDREW
               Alright, what about your family?

                            BENDER
               Oh, mine?

                            ANDREW
               That's real easy!

     Bender stands again and points forward.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Stupid, worthless, no good, God
               damned, freeloading, son of a bitch,
               retarded, bigmouth, know it all,
               asshole, jerk!
                       (as his mother)
               You forgot ugly, lazy and
               disrespectful.

     Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable
     mother.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Shut up bitch!  Go fix me a turkey
               pot pie!
                    (as himself)
               What about you Dad?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself--yelling)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father--yelling)
               Fuck you!

     He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him.

                            BRIAN
               Is that for real?

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               You wanna come over sometime?

                            ANDREW
               That's bullshit.  It's all part of
               your image, I don't believe a word
               of it.

     Bender actually looks hurt.

                     BENDER
               You don't believe me?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BENDER
               No?

                            ANDREW
               Did I stutter?

     Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right
     sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.

                            BENDER
               Do you believe this?  Huh?  It's
               about the size of a cigar...Do I
               stutter?  You see, this is what you
               get in my house when you spill paint
               in the garage.

     Bender begins to walk away.

                            BENDER
               See I don't think that I need to
               sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

     Bender walks over to a map table and throws all the
     maps on the floor.  He climbs up on top of the table and
     then up to the second floor balcony.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               You shouldn't have said that!

                            ANDREW
               How would I know, I mean he lies
               about everything anyway!
                                                 CUT TO:

19. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to
     pour coffee out of his thermos.  The top comes off and
     the coffee goes all over his desk.

                            VERNON
               Oh, shit!
                                                  CUT TO:

20. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.

                            VERNON
               Coffee...looks like they scrape it
               off the bottom of the Mississippi
               river.  Everything's polluted,
               everything's polluted...the coffee.

     Bender comes out of the library doors followed
     bye veryone else.

     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.
     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the
     end of the line, Allison is following.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               How do you know where Vernon went?

                            BENDER
               I don't...

                            CLAIRE
               Well then, how do you know when he'll
               be back?

                            BENDER
               I don't...being bad feels pretty
               good, huh?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               What's the point in going to Bender's
               locker?

                            ANDREW
               Beats me...

                            BRIAN
               This is so stupid...Why do you think,
               why are we risking getting caught?

                            ANDREW
               I dunno...

                            BRIAN
               So then what are we doing?

                            ANDREW
               You ask me one more question and I'm
               beating the shit out of you!

                            BRIAN
               Sorry...

     Bender opens his locker.

                            ANDREW
               Slob!

                            BENDER
               My maid's on vacation.

     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.

                            BRIAN
               Drugs...

                            ANDREW
              Screw that Bender...put it back!

     Bender walks away.

                         BRIAN
               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.

     Claire walks after Bender.

                            BRIAN
               That was marijuana!

                            ANDREW
               Shut up!

     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison
     who is standing there with her mouth open.

                            BRIAN
               Do you approve of this?

     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of
     Bender's locker.

     We see the crowd walking down the hall.

                            BENDER
               We'll cross through the lab, and
               then we'll double back.

                            ANDREW
               You better be right, if Vernon cuts
               us off it's your fault, asshole!

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               What'd he say?  Where're we going?

     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various
     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon
     until they stop.

                            BENDER
               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We
               have to go through the cafeteria!

                            ANDREW
               No, the activities hall.

                            BENDER
               Hey man, you don't know what you're
               talking about!

                            ANDREW
               No you don't know what you're
               talking about!

     Allison squeaks.

                            ANDREW
               Now we're through listening to you,
               we're going this way.

     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by
     an iron gate.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

                            BENDER
               Great idea Jagoff!

                            ANDREW
               Fuck you!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to
               John?

                            BRIAN
               We're dead!

                            BENDER
               No, just me!

                            BRIAN
               What do you mean?

                            BENDER
               Get back to the library, keep your
               unit on this!

     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's
     underwear.

     Bender runs away singing loudly.  I wanna be an
     airborne ranger...

     We see Vernon hear Bender.

     The rest of them run.

                            VERNON
               That son of a bitch!

     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in
     the gym.

     Bender is going up for a basket.

                            BENDER
               Three...two...one!

     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is
               this?  What are you doing here, what
               is this?

                            BENDER
               Oh, hi!

                            VERNON
               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's
               over!

                            BENDER
               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?

                            VERNON
               Out!

                            BENDER
               I'm thinking of trying out for a
               scholarship.

                            VERNON
               Gimmie the ball, Bender.

     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball
     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.

     They leave.

21. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     The rest of the kids are all sitting back in their
     seats when Bender and Vernon enter.  Vernon pushes Bender.

                            VERNON
               Get your stuff, let's go!
                    (to everyone)
               Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon
               himself to go to the gymnasium.  I'm
               sorry to inform you, you're going to
               be without his services for the rest
               of the day.

                            BENDER
                    (to Vernon)
               B-O-O H-O-O!

                            VERNON
               Everything's a big joke, huh Bender?
               The false alarm you pulled, Friday,
               false alarms are really funny,
               aren't they...What if your home,
               what if your family...
                    (a beat)
               ...what if your dope was on fire?

                            BENDER
               Impossible, sir...It's in Johnson's
               underwear...

     Andrew laughs.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               You think he's funny?  You think
               this is cute?  You think he's
               bitchin', is that it?  Lemme tell
               you something.  Look at him, he's a
               bum.
                    (to everybody)
               You wanna see something funny?  You
               go visit John Bender in five years!
               You'll see how God damned funny he
               is!
                    (to Bender)
               What's the matter, John?  You gonna
               cry?  Let's go...

     Vernon grabs Bender's shoulder.

                            BENDER
               Hey keep your fuckin' hands off me!
               I expect better manners from you,
               Dick!

     Bender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays
     them in front of Andrew.

                            BENDER
               For better hallway vision!

     Bender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the
     way.

21. INT. CLOSET - DAY

     Vernon has put Bender in a closet and is in there
     talking to him.

                            VERNON
               That's the last time, Bender.  That's
               the last time you ever make me look
               bad in front of those kids, do you
               hear me?  I make $31,000 dollars a
               year and I have a home and I'm not
               about to throw it away on some punk
               like you...But someday, man, someday.
               When you're outta here and you've
               forgotten all about this place...
               And they've forgotten all about you
               and you're wrapped up in your own
               pathetic life...I'm gonna be there.
               That's right.  And I'm gonna kick
               the living shit out of you, man, I'm
               gonna knock your dick in the dirt!

                            BENDER
               Are you threatening me?

                            VERNON
               What're you gonna do about it?  You
               think anybody's gonna believe you?
               You think anybody's gonna take your
               word over mine?  I'm a man of
               respect around here.  They love me
               around here, I'm a swell guy...you're
               a lying sack of shit!  And everybody
               knows it.  Oh, you're a real tough
               guy...come on, come on...get on your
               feet, pal!  Let's find out how
               tough you are!  I wanna know right
               now, how tough you are!  Come on!
               I'll give you the first punch, let's
               go!  Come on, right here, just take
               the first shot!  Please, I'm begging
               you, take a shot!  Come on, just
               take one shot, that's all I need,
               just one swing...

     Bender just sits there staring at Vernon.  Vernon fakes
     a punch and Bender flinches.

                            VERNON
               That's what I though...you're a
               gutless turd!

     Vernon leaves and locks the closet door after him.
     Bender climbs into a hatch in the ceiling and
     disappears.

               A naked blond walks into a bar, with
               a poodle under one arm and a two
               foot salami under the other.  She
               lays the poodle on the table.  Bar-
               tender says: "I suppose you won't
               be needing a drink."  The naked
               lady says...

     The ceiling under Bender gives and he falls through.

     We hear Vernon in the hall.

               God damnit!  What in God's name is
               going on in here?

     Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
              What was that ruckus?

                            ANDREW
               Uh, what ruckus?

                            VERNON
               I was just in my office and I heard
               a ruckus!

                            BRIAN
               Could you describe the ruckus, sir?

               Watch your tongue young man, watch
               it!

     We see Bender under the table by Claire's legs.  He
     sits up and bangs his head on the table.  He groans.

     Above the table, Andrew and Claire try to take credit
     for the noise by making more noise.

                            VERNON
               What is that?  What, what is that,
               what is that noise?

     Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and
     can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's
     legs.

                            ANDREW
               What noise?

                            CLAIRE
               Really, sir, there wasn't any noise...

     Claire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her
     knees.

     Everyone starts faking a coughing fit.

                            CLAIRE
                    (flustered)
               That noise?  Was that the noise you
               were talking about?

                            VERNON
               No, it wasn't.  That was not the
               noise I was talking about.  Now, I
               may not have caught you in the act
               this time, but you can bet I will.

     Allison laughs at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               You make book on that missy!

               And you!  I will not be made a fool
               of!

     He turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the
     toilet seat cover stuck to his pants.
     Vernon leaves.

     Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a
     barage of slaps.

                            BENDER

     smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice.

     Brian waves Claire over to him and he falls over.

     We see Andrew emerge from a really smokey room.  He
     inhales another puff and then starts dancing to
     everybody's applause.

     He goes back in the room he was in.  He screams and it

     as she speaks, she moves over and sits next to the two.

                           ALLISON
               Your middle name is Ralph, as in
               puke...

     Brian and Andrew look at her in confusion.

                           ALLISON
               ...your birthday is March 12th,
               you're five-nine and a half you
               weigh a hundred and thirty pounds
               and your social security number is
               0-4-9-3-8-0-9-1
                    (a beat)
               3.

     Andrew is impressed.

                            ANDREW
               Wow!  Are you psychic?

                           ALLISON
               No...

                            BRIAN
               Well would you mind telling me how
               you know all this about me?

     Allison reaches in her bag.

                           ALLISON
               I stole your wallet...

     She produces it in her hands and grins.

                            BRIAN
               Give it to me...

                           ALLISON
               No...

                            BRIAN
               Give it!

     Allison reluctantly hands over the wallet and Brian
     glances through it to make sure nothing is missing.

                            BRIAN
               This is great...you're a thief too!
               Huh?

                           ALLISON
               I'm not a thief!

                            BRIAN
               Multi-talented!

                           ALLISON
               What's there to steal?  Two bucks
               and a beaver shot!

                            ANDREW
               A what?

                          ALLISON
               He's got a nudie picture in there!
               I saw it, it's perverted!

                            ANDREW
               Alright, let's see it!

     We see Bender, he is brushing his teeth with one of
     Claire's cosmetic brushes.

     We see Claire looking through Bender's wallet pictures.

                            CLAIRE
               Are all these your girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               Some of them...

                            CLAIRE
               What about the others?

                            BENDER
               Well, some I consider my girlfriends
               and some...I just consider...

                            CLAIRE
               Consider what?

                            BENDER
               Whether or not, I wanna hang out
               with them...

                            CLAIRE
               You don't believe in just one guy,
               one girl?

                            BENDER
               Do you?

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah...that's the way it should be.

                            BENDER
               Well, not for me...

                            CLAIRE
               Why not?

     Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that.  He acts
     defensive.

                            BENDER
               How come you got so much shit in
               your purse?

                            CLAIRE
               How come you got so many
               girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               I asked you first...

                            CLAIRE
                    (shrugs)
               I dunno...I guess I never throw
               anything away.

                            BENDER
               Neither do I...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh...

     We cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are
     sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet.

                            ANDREW
               This is the worst fake ID I've ever
               seen...

     Brian laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Do you realize you made yourself
               sixty eight?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, I know...I know, I goofed it...

                            ANDREW
               What do you need a fake ID for?

                            BRIAN
                    (like it's obvious)
               So I can vote!

     Allison looks up suddenly.

                           ALLISON
               You wanna see what's in my bag?

                        BRIAN & ANDREW
               No!

     Allison looks hurt and then resentful.  Just to spite
     them, she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch.

     Lots of stuff comes out.

                            ANDREW
               Holy shit!  What is all that stuff?

                            BRIAN
               Do you always carry this much shit
               in your bag?

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...I always carry this much shit
               ...in my bag...You never know when
               you may have to jam...

                            BRIAN
               Are you gonna be like a shopping
               bag lady?  You know like, sit in
               alleyways and like talk to buildings
               and wear men's shoes and that kinda
               thing?

                           ALLISON
               I'll do what I have to do...

                            BRIAN
               Why do you have to do anything?

                           ALLISON
                    (with feeling)
               My home life is un...satisfying...

                            BRIAN
               So you're saying you'd subject
               yourself to the violent dangers of
               the Chicago streets because your
               homelife is unsatisfying?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have to run away and live
               in the street...I can run away and,
               go to the ocean, I can go to the
               country, I can go to the mountains.
               I can go to Israel, Africa,
               Afghanistan...

     Brian looks at her and then moves over to Andrew.

                            BRIAN
               Andy...you wanna get in on this?
               Allison here says, she wants to run
               away, because her home life is
               unsatisfying...

                            ANDREW
               Well everyone's home lives are un-
               satisfying...If it wasn't, people
               would live with there parents
               forever...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, yeah I understand.  But I
               think that her's goes beyond, you
               know, what guys like you and me...
               consider normal unsatisfying...

                           ALLISON
               Nevermind...forget it, everything's
               cool!

     Allison starts putting everything back in her purse.

                            ANDREW
               What's the deal?

                           ALLISON
               No!  There's no deal, Sporto.
               Forget it, leave me alone.

                            ANDREW
               Wait a minute, now you're carrying
               all that crap around in your purse.
               Either you really wanna run away or
               you want people to think you wanna
               run away.

                           ALLISON
               Eat shit!

     Allison gets up and walks away.

                            BRIAN
               The girl is an island, with herself.
               Okay?

     Andrew gets up and goes after her.

                            ANDREW
               Hi, you wanna talk?

                           ALLISON
               No!

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

                           ALLISON
               Go away...

                            ANDREW
               Where do you want me to go?

                           ALLISON
               GO away!

     Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry.

                           ALLISON
               You have problems...

                            ANDREW
               Oh, I have problems?

                           ALLISON
               You do everything everybody ever
               tells you to do, that is a problem!

                            ANDREW
               Okay, fine...but I didn't dump my
               purse out on the couch and invite
               people into my problems...Did I?
               So what's wrong?  What is it?  Is
               is bad?  Real bad?  Parents?

     Allison is silently crying.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...

     Andrew nods.

                            ANDREW
               What do they do to you?

                           ALLISON
              They ignore me...

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...yeah...

     They both are crying silently.
                                                  CUT TO:

29. INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Vernon and Carl are sitting talking.

                            VERNON
               What did you want to be when you
               were young?

                             CARL
               When I was a kid, I wanted to be
               John Lennon...

                            VERNON
               Carl don't be a goof!  I'm trying
               to make a serious point here...I've
               been teaching, for twenty two years,
               and each year...these kids get more
               and more arrogant.

                             CARL
               Aw bull shit, man.  Come on Vern,
               the kids haven't changed, you have!
               You took a teaching position, 'cause
               you thought it'd be fun, right?
               Thought you could have summer
               vacations off...and then you found
               out it was actually work...and that
               really bummed you out.

                            VERNON
               These kids turned on me...they think
               I'm a big fuckin' joke...

                             CARL
               Come on...listen Vern, if you were
               sixteen, what would you think of
               you, huh?

                            VERNON
               Hey...Carl, you think I give one
               rat's ass what these kids think of
               me?

                             CARL
               Yes I do...

                            VERNON
               You think about this...when you get
               old, these kids; when I get old,
               they're gonna be runnin' the country.

                             CARL
               Yeah?

                            VERNON
               Now this is the thought that wakes
               me up in the middle of the night...
               That when I get older, these kids
               are gonna take care of me...

                             CARL
               I wouldn't count on it!

     Vernon ponders that statement for a moment.

30. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.

                            ANDREW
               What would I do for a million bucks?
               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I
               had to...

                            CLAIRE
               That's boring...

                            ANDREW
               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?

                            CLAIRE
               The idea is to like search your mind
               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,
               would you drive to school naked?

     Andrew laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Um, uh...would I have to get out of
               the car?

                            CLAIRE
               Of course...

                            ANDREW
               In the spring, or winter?

                            CLAIRE
               It doesn't matter...spring...

                            ANDREW
               In front of the school or in back
               of the school?

                            CLAIRE
               Either one...

                            ANDREW
               Yes...

                           ALLISON
               I'd do that!

     They all look at her.

                           ALLISON
               I'll do anything sexual, I don't
               need a million dollars to do it
               either...

                            CLAIRE
               You're lying...

                           ALLISON
               I already have...I've done just
               about everything there is except a
               few things that are illegal...I'm a
               nymphomaniac!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                            CLAIRE
               Lie...

                            BRIAN
               Are your parents aware of this?

                           ALLISON
               The only person I told was my
               shrink...

                            ANDREW
               And what'd he do when you told him?

                           ALLISON
               He nailed me...

                            CLAIRE
               Very nice...

                           ALLISON
               I don't think that from a legal
               standpoint what he did can be
               construed as rape since I paid him.

                            CLAIRE
               He's an adult!

     Allison is relishing this attention.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...he's married too!

     Claire notes her disgust.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you have any idea how completely
               gross that is?

                           ALLISON
               Well, the first few times...

                            CLAIRE
               First few times?  You mean he did it
               more than once?

                           ALLISON
               Sure...

                            CLAIRE
               Are you crazy?

                            BRIAN
               Obviously she's crazy if she's
               screwing her shrink...

                           ALLISON
                    (to Claire)
               Have you ever done it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't even have a psychiatrist...

                           ALLISON
               Have you ever done it with a normal
               person?

                            CLAIRE
               Now, didn't we already cover this?

                            BENDER
               You never answered the question...

                            CLAIRE
               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my
               private life with total strangers.

                           ALLISON
               It's kind of a double-edged sword,
               isn't it?

                            CLAIRE
               A what?

                           ALLISON
               Well, if you say you haven't...
               you're a prude.  If you say you
               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.
               You want to but you can't but when
               you do you wish you didn't, right?

                            CLAIRE
               Wrong...

                           ALLISON
               Or, are you a tease?

                            ANDREW
               She's a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh why don't you just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You're a tease and you know it, all
               girls are teases!

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               She's only a tease if what she does
               gets you hot...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't do anything!

                           ALLISON
               That's why you're a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.

     Allison is suddenly defensive.

                           ALLISON
               I've already told you everything!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep
               around without being in love.  I
               mean don't you want any respect?

                           ALLISON
               I don't screw to get respect...That's
               the difference between you and me...

                            CLAIRE
               Not the only difference, I hope.

                            BENDER
               Face it, you're a tease.

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not a tease!

                            BENDER
               Sure you are!  You said it yourself
               sex is a weapon, you use it to get
               respect!

                            CLAIRE
               No, I never said that, she twisted
               my words around.

                            BENDER
               Oh then what do you use it for?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't use it period!

     Claire is on the verge of tears.

                            BENDER
               Oh, are you medically frigid or is
               it psychological?

                            CLAIRE
               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys
               are putting words into my mouth!

                            BENDER
               Well if you'd just answer the
               question...

                            BRIAN
               Why don't you just answer the
               question?

                            ANDREW
               Be honest...

                            BENDER
               No big deal...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, answer it!

                            ANDREW
               Answer the question, Claire!

                            BENDER
               Talk to us!

                       ANDREW & BRIAN
               Come on, answer the question!

                            BENDER
               It's easy, it's only one question!

     Claire silences all of them by screaming.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screaming)
               No!  I never did it!

     Silence for two beats.

                           ALLISON
               I never did it either, I'm not a
               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive
               liar...

                            CLAIRE
               You are such a bitch!  You did that
               on purpose just to fuck me over!

                           ALLISON
               I would do it though...If you love
               someone it's okay...

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you, you're so
               weird.  You don't say anything all
               day and then when you open your
               mouth...you unload all these
               tremendous lies all over me!

                            ANDREW
               You're just pissed off because she
               got you to admit something you didn't
               want to admit to...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it
               any less bizarre...

                            ANDREW
               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all
               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just
               better at hiding it, that's all.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               How are you bizarre?

     Allison decides to field that question.

                           ALLISON
               He can't think for himself...

                            ANDREW
               She's right...do you guys know what,
               uh, what I did to get in here?  I
               taped Larry Lester's buns together.

     Claire laughs.

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               That was you?

                           ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               Yeah, you know him?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I know him...

                            ANDREW
               Well then you know how hairy he is,
               right?  Well, when they pulled the
               tape off, most of his hair came off
               and some, some skin too...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh my God...

                            ANDREW
               And the bizarre thing is, is that
               I did it for my old man...I
               tortured this poor kid, because I
               wanted him to think that I was cool.
               He's always going off about, you
               know, when he was in school...all
               the wild things he used to do.  And
               I got the feeling that he was
               disappointed that I never cut loose
               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
               sitting in the locker room, and I'm
               taping up my knee.  And Larry's
               undressing a couple lockers down
               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...
               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I
               started thinking about my father,
               and his attitude about weakness.
               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
               jumped on top of him and started
               wailing on him...And my friends,
               they just laughed and cheered me on.
               And afterwards, when I was sittin'
               in Vernon's office, all I could
               think about was Larry's father. And
               Larry havin' to go home and...and
               explain what happened to him.  And
               the humiliation...fucking
               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It
               mustuv been unreal...I mean,
                    (he's crying)
               I mean, how do you apologize for
               something like that?  There's no
               way...it's all because of me and
               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate
               him!  He's like this...he's like
               this mindless machine that I can't
               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
               you've got to be number one!  I
               won't tolerate any losers in this
               family...Your intensity is for shit!
               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a
               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish
               my knee would give...and I wouldn't
               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he
               could forget all about me...

                            BENDER
               I think your old man and my old man
               should get together and go bowling.

     Andrew laughs briefly.

                            BRIAN
               It's like me, you know, with my
               grades...like, when I, when I
               step outside myself kinda, and
               when I, when I look in at myself
               you know?  And I see me and I don't
               like what I see, I really don't.

                            CLAIRE
               What's wrong with you?  Why don't
               you like yourself?

                            BRIAN
               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing
               shop.  See we had this assignment,
               to make this ceramic elephant, and
               um...and we had eight weeks to do
               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was
               like a lamp, and when you pull the
               trunk the light was s'posed to go
               on...my light didn't go on, I got a
               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...
               When I signed up, you know, for the
               course I mean.  I thought I was
               playing it real smart, you know.
               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,
               it'll be such an easy way to
               maintain my grade point average...

                            BENDER
               Why'd you think it'd be easy?

                            BRIAN
               Have you seen some of the dopes that
               take shop?

                            BENDER
               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'
               idiot!

                            BRIAN
               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't
               make a lamp?

                            BENDER
               No, you're a genius because you
               can't make a lamp...

                            BRIAN
               What do you know about Trigonometry?

                            BENDER
               I could care less about
               Trigonometry...

                            BRIAN
               Bender, did you know without
               Trigonometry there'd be no
               engineering?

                            BENDER
               Without lamps, there'd be no light!

                            CLAIRE
              Okay so neither one of you is any
               better than the other one...

     Allison feels left out.

                           ALLISON
               I can write with my toes!  I can
               also eat, brush my teeth...

                            CLAIRE
               With your feet?

                           ALLISON
               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.

                            BRIAN
               I can make spaghetti!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               What can you do?

                            ANDREW
               I can...uh...tape all your buns
               together...

                            BENDER
               I wanna see what Claire can do!

                            CLAIRE
               I can't do anything.

                            BENDER
               Now, everybody can do something...

                            CLAIRE
               There's one thing I can do, no
               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.

                            BENDER
               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean
               that guy's been doing that show for
               thirty years.

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, but you have to swear to God
               you won't laugh...I can't believe
               I'm actually doing this...

     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it
     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.

     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.

      Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.

                            ANDREW
               All right, great!  Where'd you learn
               to do that?

                            CLAIRE
               Camp, seventh grade...

                            BENDER
               That was great, Claire...my image of
               you is totally blown...

                           ALLISON
               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her
               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!

                            BENDER
               Am I laughing?

                            ANDREW
               You fucking prick!

     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his
     words hitting home.

                            BENDER
               What do you care what I think,
               anyway?  I don't even count, right?
               I could disappear forever and it
               wouldn't make any difference...I may
               as well not even exist at this
               school, remember?
                    (he turns to Claire)
               And you...don't like me anyway!

                            CLAIRE
               You know, I have just as many
               feelings as you do and it hurts
               just as much when somebody steps
               all over them!

                            BENDER
               God, you're so pathetic!
                    (furious)
               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare
               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got
               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'
               Rapunzel, right?  School would
               probably fucking shut down if you
               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't
               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.

                            CLAIRE
                    (quietly)
               Shut up...

                            BENDER
               Are those real diamonds, Claire?

                            CLAIRE
                    (angry)
               Shut up!

                    BENDER                       CLAIRE
          I bet they are...did you
          work, for the money               Shut...
          for those earrings?                   Your mouth!

                            BENDER
               Or did your daddy buy those?

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious)
               Shut up!

     Claire starts crying.

                            BENDER
               I bet he bought those for you!  I
               bet those are a Christmas gift!
               Right?  You know what I got for
               Christmas this year?  It was a
               banner fuckin' year at the old
               Bender family!  I got a carton of
               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me
               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"
               Okay, so go home'n cry to your
               daddy, don't cry here, okay?

     There are a few beats.

                            ANDREW
               My God, are we gonna be like our
               parents?

                            CLAIRE
               Not me...ever...

                           ALLISON
               It's unavoidable, it just happens.

                            CLAIRE
               What happens?

                           ALLISON
               When you grow up, your heart dies.

                            BENDER
               Who cares?

     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.

                           ALLISON
               I care...

                            BRIAN
               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I
               know it's kind of a weird time, but
               I was just wondering, um, what is
               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When
               we're all together again?  I mean I
               consider you guys my friends, I'm
               not wrong, am I?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BRIAN
               So, so on Monday...what happens?

                            CLAIRE
               Are we still friends, you mean?
               If we're friends now, that is?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah...

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want the truth?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I want the truth...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't think so...

                           ALLISON
               Well, do you mean all of us or just
               John?

                            CLAIRE
               With all of you...

                            ANDREW
               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!

                            CLAIRE
               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came
               walking up to you in the hall on
               Monday, what would you do?  I mean
               picture this, you're there with all
               the sports.  I know exactly what
               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up
               so your friends wouldn't think you
               really liked him!

                            ANDREW
               No way!

                           ALLISON
               'Kay, what if I came up to you?

                            CLAIRE
               Same exact thing!

                            BENDER
                    (furious and screaming at Claire)
               You are a bitch!

                            CLAIRE
               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,
               that makes me a bitch?

                            BENDER
               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that
               is to do to someone!  And you don't
               got the balls to stand up to your
               friends and tell 'em that you're
               gonna like who you wanna like!

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
               Why don't you take Allison to one of
               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or
               take Brian out to the parking lot at
               lunch to get high?  What about Andy
               for that matter, what about me?
               What would your friends say if we
               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
               doing it with me so they'd forgive
               you for being seen with me.

                            BENDER
                    (furious once again)
               Don't you ever talk about my
               friends!  You don't know any of my
               friends, you don't look at any of my
               friends and you certainly wouldn't
               condescend to speak to any of my
               friends so you just stick to the
               things you know, shopping, nail
               polish, your father's BMW and your
               poor--rich--drunk mother in the
               Carribean!

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious and sobbing)
               Shut up!

                            BENDER
               And as far as being concerned about
               what's gonna happen when you and I
               walk down the hallways at school,
               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never
               gonna happen!  Just bury your head
               in the sand...and wait for your
               fuckin' prom!

                            CLAIRE
               I hate you!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?  Good!

     There is silence until Brian speaks.

                            BRIAN
               Then I assume Allison and I are
               better people than you guys, huh?
               Us weirdos...
                    (to Allison)
               Do you, would you do that to me?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have any friends...

                            BRIAN
               Well if you did?

                           ALLISON
               No...I don't think the kind of
               friends I'd have would mind...

                            BRIAN
               I just wanna tell, each of you,
               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't
               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's
               real shitty...

                            CLAIRE
               Your friends wouldn't mind because
               they look up to us...

     Brian laughs at her.

                            BRIAN
               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're
               so conceited.  You're so, like, full
               of yourself, why are you like that?

                            CLAIRE
                    (crying again)
               I'm not saying that to be conceited!
               I hate it!  I hate having to go
               along with everything my friends say!

                            BRIAN
               Well then why do you do it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, I don't...you don't
               understand..you don't.  You're not
               friends with the same kind of people
               that Andy and I are friends with!
               You know, you just don't understand
               the pressure that they can put on
               you!

     Brian is shocked.

                            BRIAN
               I don't understand what?  You think
               I don't understand pressure, Claire?
               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!

     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.

                            BRIAN
               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?
               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a
               gun in the locker...

                            ANDREW
               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

                            BRIAN
               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk
               on it and the light's s'posed to go
               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,
               I...

                            ANDREW
               What's the gun for Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You brought it up, man!

                            BRIAN
               I can't have an F, I can't have it
               and I know my parents can't have it!
               Even if I aced the rest of the
               semester, I'm still only a B.  And
               everything's ruined for me!

                            CLAIRE
                    (with pity)
               Oh Brian...

     Brian bashes a chair over.

                            BRIAN
               So I considered my options, you
               know?

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Killing yourself is not an
               option!

                            BRIAN
               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I
               don't think so!

                           ALLISON
               It was a hand gun?

                            BRIAN
               No, it was a flare gun, went off
               in my locker.

                            ANDREW
               Really?

     Andrew starts to laugh.

                            BRIAN
               It's not funny...

     They all start to laugh, including Brian.

                            BRIAN
               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was
               destroyed!

                           ALLISON
               You wanna know what I did to get in
               here?  Nothing...I didn't have
               anything better to do.

     Everyone laughs.

                           ALLISON
               You're laughing at me...

                            ANDREW
               No!

     Allison starts to laugh too.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah you are!
                                                  CUT TO:

31. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     We see Brian putting a record on and then music starts.

     We see them all dancing.  This goes on for the duration
     of the song.
                                                  CUT TO:

32. INT. HEATING DUCT - DAY

     We see Bender crawling back through the heating duct.
                                                  CUT TO:

33. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that
     order on the railing.

                            CLAIRE
               Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah?

                            CLAIRE
               Are you gonna write your paper?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, why?

                            CLAIRE
               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of
               us to write our paper, don't you
               think?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us
               to do...

                            CLAIRE
               True, but I think we'd all kinda
               say the same thing.

                            BRIAN
               You just don't want to write your
               paper...Right?

                            CLAIRE
               True, but, you're the smartest,
               right?

                            BRIAN
                    (with pride)
               Oh, well...

                            CLAIRE
               We trust you...

     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in
     approval.

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

                            BRIAN
               All right, I'll do it...

                            CLAIRE
               Great...

     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Allison)
               Come on...

                           ALLISON
               Where're we going?

                            CLAIRE
               Come on!

     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.

                            CLAIRE
               Don't be afraid.

                           ALLISON
               Don't stick that in my eye!

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not sticking it, just close...
               just go like that...

     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.

                            CLAIRE
               Good...

     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.

                            CLAIRE
               You know you really do look a lot
               better without all that black shit
               on your eyes...

                           ALLISON
               Hey...I like that black shit...

                            CLAIRE
               This looks a lot better...look up.

     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.

     We see Andrew just thinking.

     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still
     putting make-up on Allison.

                           ALLISON
               Please, why're you being so nice to
               me?

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause you're letting me.

     We see Brian begin to write.

     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     We see Bender, in the closet once again.  Claire opens
     the door and enters.

                            BENDER
               You lost?

     Claire stares at him.

     Bender smiles.

     Brian is busily preparing the essay.

     Andrew looks up and sees the newly made over Allison
     and is in awe.

     Allison walks towards him and stops when she notices
     Brian staring at her with his mouth open.

     She glares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Cool!

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

                            BENDER
               You know how you said before, how
               your parents used you to get back
               at each other...wouldn't I be
               outstanding in that capacity?

                            CLAIRE
               Were you really disgusted about
               what I did with my lipstick?

        Why?  Claire did it!  What's wrong?

                            ANDREW
               Nothing's wrong, it's just so
               different.  I can see your face.

                           ALLISON
               Is that good or bad?

                            ANDREW

    Andrew gets into the car and they drive off.

     We see Claire take out one of her diamond earrings

               Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact
               that we had to sacrifice a whole
               Saturday in detention for whatever
               it was we did wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make an essay
               telling you who we think we are.
               You see us as you want to see us...
               In the simplest terms, in the most
               convenient definitions.

                         FADE IN

          EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1

          A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation.
          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the
          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it
          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys
          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their
          walk. MIIï¿½ is singing. The others are humming along. The
          melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie"
          but it's a loose version.

                         MIME

          AND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY ME

          ON THE"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P

          BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS

          AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS

          I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R

          TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P.

          I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR

          TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL.
          By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is
          handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER
          is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a
          large trophy.

                         DAVE
          Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot

                         CYRIL
          Did you really make all that up?
          They pass.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More
          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed
          by them. They have to climb over some.

                         MIKE
          I sent away for this stuff from
          Wyoming. It'll tell you everything.
          Since you don't believe me maybe
          you'll believe it when you see it.

                         CYRIL
          And we'd work on the same ranch
          and sleep in the bunkhouse
          together, eh?

          That's the whole point.

          I always miss the whole point.

                         MOOCHER
          It'd be nice to have a paying
          Job again, that's for sure.

                         DAVE
          Niente laborare. Niente mangare.

                         MIKE
          What's that mean?

                         DAVE
          You don't work. You don't eat.

                         CYRIL
          That's a terrible thing to say.

          MED. SHOT
          The quarries are felt even more now. Walls of stone rise
          up around the guys.

                         CYRIL
          Are you really going to shave
          your legs?

                         DAVE
          Certo. All the Italians do it.

                         MIKE
          That's some country. The women
          don't shave theirs.

                         CYRIL

          STOP!

          You see what I saved you from,
          Cyril. Had I not told you about
          the two of them you never would
          have followed them out here.

                         CYRIL-
          Thank you, Mike. You made me
          lose all interest in life and
          I'm grateful.

          My brother says he saw you and
          Nancy. Moocher.

          When?

                         MIKE
          Last Friday?

          Wasn't me. I'm not seeing her
          anymore.

          They are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer
          cliffs on three sides. Abandoned derricks loom in the
          distance. Dave is now humming softly a Neapolitan song.
          They begin the descent.

                         CYRIL
          I kind of miss school. You know.
          This will be the first time nobody's
          going to ask us to write a theme
          about how we spent our summer.

          My dad says Jesus never went
          further than fifty miles from
          his home.
          Mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water, taking
          clothes off as he does. The rest follow.

                         MIKE
          And look what happened to him.
          Mike jumps into the water. Moocher and Cyril follow. Dave
          looks on.

          Italian Phrase Book. Finds what he wants.

          All four guys are sunbathing looking at the water. Deep X
          down, at the bottom of the quarry hole we see an old icebox.
          Mike is staring at it. The mood is one of total relaxation.

          A cartoon of some kind. Man, X
          that'd be great. Like when they
          get hit on their head with a
          frying pan and their head looks
          like a frying pan-with a handle
          and everything. And then they go
          b-r-r-r.
          (shakes his head)
          And their head comes back to
          normal. That'd be great..

          I don't know. I think I have
          a dumb heredity. What's your

          Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up.
          He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys
          talk as they follow his progress.

          Yeah, my Dad called. He says
          there's a lot more jobs in'Chicago.
          He hasn't got anything yet.
          Mike has reached the icebox. He opens the door. Goes in.
          Shuts the door.

                         MOOCHER
          He wanted to know if the house
          was sold. They could use the
          money.

          You can come and live with me
          when it's sold. In Italy
          everybody lives together.
          All three of them are getting concerned about Mike.

                         MOOCHER
          Ever since you won that Italian X
          bike you've been acting weird. You
          really think you are Italian.

          Maybe the door is stuck. God
          dammit!
          Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims
          down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface.
          As soon as they hit the surface we hear:

          It's got no back on it!
          He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he
          pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other
          side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys
          are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Dave, Moocher and Cyril are standing on the rocks below Mike.
          Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the
          College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys
          is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are
          looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent
          on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty
          feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful
          somersault into a swan dive.

          CLOSEUP - OUR GUYS
          They are stunned.

          CLOSEUP - MIKE
          He's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the
          guys and seems to feel his position undermined.

          speeding toward them. X

          EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 7

          Mike's car turns into a street called Fraternity Row.- Most
          of the fraternities and sororities-are located along this
          stretch. Neat lawns line the area. The houses are enormous:
          an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel.
          The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading.
          Girls in bikinis sunbathing. Guys washing their cars. Some
          other guys passing the football around. Transistor radios
          playing. Mike drives slowly.

          INT. MIKE'S CAR

          All the guys are looking out of the windows as if they were
          in a museum. Mike looks at the expensive cars along the way.
          Cyril looks at the Girls in bikinis. Moocher looks at the
          huge well-built guys. Dave just looks.

          Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing
          Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the
          Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is
          moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on
          the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running
          to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave
          gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep
          from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give'
          Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.

                         MIKE
          Hey, those bastards are giving
          us the finger.
          He slams on the brakes.

          Hey, c'mon, Mike. We're on
          their turf.
          Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are
          challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two
          Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning
          the car.

                         MIKE
          They think they own the place.

          enough. In ancient Japan when
          you ran over a samurai's Frisbee
          he had to commit suicide.
          Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The
          two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road.
          The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop,
          but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the
          Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again
          Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having
          scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in
          the direction he came from.

          MR. BLASE is sitting at a kitchen table. MRS. BLASE is
          boiling water. Mr. Blase does not look happy. He's got
          a flyswatter in his hand. He sees a fly. Whack. He hits
          it. He misses.

          MR. BLASE
          It's that cologne he wears.

          MRS. BLASE
          Neapolitan Sunset, it's called.

          MR. BLASE
          Well, it smells like fruit
          punch to me and it attracts
          flies.
          Mrs. Blase comes over and pours some hot water into his cup.
          She takes a package of Sanka from her apron pocket and puts
          it in the saucer.

          MRS. BLASE
          There.
          Mrs. Blase looks at the table.

          MR. BLASE
          This is itl

          MRS. BLASE
          You have to watch your diet.

          MR. BLASE
          Diet, if anybody found out I
          was on the diet they'd laugh
          me out of town. A diet.

          MRS. BLASE
          You know what the doctor said.
          At your age...

          MR. BLASE
          At my agel What the hell do you
          mean at my age.

          MRS. BLASE
          He says you have a bad heart.

          MR. BLASE
          Yeah, but it's got nothing to do
          with my age. It's our son that's
          ruining my heart, Evelyn. What's
          he going to do? He wanted a year
          with those bums so I gave him a year.

          So now his body's fine but his
          mind is gone. He used to be a
          smart kid. I thought he was
          going to goy to college.

          MRS. BLASE
          I thought you didn't want him
          to go to college.

          MR. BLASE
          Why should he go to college?
          I didn't go to college. When I
          was nineteen I was working in the
          quarries ten hours a day.

          MRS. BLASE
          But most of the quarries have
          shut down.

          MR. BLASE
          Let him find another job.

          MRS. BLASE
          But there aren't any jobs.

          Dave opens the fridge and takes out a hunk of cheese and a
          hunk of salami and starts eating. Mr. Blase looks at him
          like a wolf and then he looks at half a grapefruit in front
          of him. He finds it unbearable to watch him chew.

          Speaking of flies...there's a
          helluva lot of flies following
          you into the house.

          Fly in Italian is 'mosca.'

          Well in English it's a pest.

          Mrs. Blase senses an argument.

          It's a nice trophy isn't it,
          dear?

          MR. BLASE
          Yeah, so what. I've lived fifty
          years without ever getting a

          Here, Papa. I give you. You

          Dave hands him the trophy. Mr. Blase is stunned. He'takes
          it. Before he can even think to give it back Dave kisses
          him on both cheeks.

          family. Mr. Blase is holding the trophy and looking at it.
          Neapolitan music is heard coming from Dave's room. Mr. Blase
          has had it.

          listening. She is apprehensive. She wants to follow and
          help Dave out but she stays behind wringing her hands.
          Mr. Blase reappears looking quite stunned. He's holding the
          trophy in one hand along his side.

          Students sit on the steps outside the buildings. They are

          obvious he's feeling a little out of place, but he enjoys
          looking at the campus world. A campus Police Car drives by

          The paper flies out but he quickly catches it in mid-air.

                         DAVE

          He has momentarily lost ground on her but he sticks the
          paper in his mouth and pours it on.

          ANGLE ON KATHERINE
          She's crossing the street just as the light changes. Dave
          crosses on the red light. Once again he's nearly hit by
          several cars. He follows Katherine up the hill leading to
          Fraternity Row. He overtakes her just as. she's about to
          turn into the drive leading to her sorority. But Dave is
          there on her right preventing her-from turning. She too
          almost hits him. She slams on her brakes. Dave slams on
          his. They come to a dead stop.

                         DAVE
          Signorina...You...
          He's handing her the paper but then he pauses and pulls it
          back just as she's about to take it. He wipes the saliva
          off the paper on his jersey, and then gives it to her.

                         DAVE
          It is yours...no?
          She takes the paper and smiles. Then she laughs.

                         KATHERINE
          You mean you've been chasing
          me with this? Well, that's
          redly something. Thank you
          very much. Talk about chivalry.
          Dave is just looking at her. She's never seen anyone look
          at her quite like that. She's a bit confused.

                         KATHERINE
          Well, thanks again.

          There's a big CAMPUS REALTY sign outside the house with a
          FOR-SALE tacked over it. NANCY is walking up to the screen
          door. She knocks. Moocher appears holding a huge barbell
          at shoulder height. They smile nervously at each other.

          He pushes the door open with one end of the barbell and lets

          Dave and Cyril are going through the outskirts of the campus.
          Dave is riding his bike slowly. Cyril is jogging along.
          They go past the Campus Arts Cinema. Dave looks at the

          back at it.

          went away. I was sure I'd get

          Moocher takes the sponge and the rag and heads for the

          Don't forget to punch the
          clock, shorty.

                         NEW ANGLE
          We see Moocher from the back. He stops suddenly when he
          hears the word "shorty." He turns around slowly. He looks
          at the Owner. He wraps the rag around his fist. And then,
          with a sudden explosive movement, he punches the clock with
          his fist, knocking it off the wall.

                         MOOCHER
          How's that?
          He tosses the sponge aside and walks out shaking the pain
          from his fist.

          E=. CAR WASH
          Moocher walks out. Mike and the guys are gone. He puts his
          bands in his pockets and starts home. Mike's car suddenly
          appears.
          Everyone is cheering. Mike's blowing his horn.
          Moocher gets in the car.

          He's feeling great. It's a nice day. He's been to church.
          He hears the music of Italy in his soul. As he's crossing

          Mrs. Blase is making some French fries. Mr. Blase is looking
          very neurotic. He's listening to the music filtering in from
          Dave's room.

          MR. BLASE
          I want an answer, Evelyn.
          What're we going to do with
          him?

          MRS. BLASE
          I don't know, dear. I suppose
          we could strangle him while
          he's asleep.

          MR. BLASE
          That's not funny, Evelyn.

          MRS. BLASE
          Why don't you talk to him.

          MR. BLASE
          I'm afraid to talk to him. I'm
          afraid to look at him. I'm
          afraid if I did, I'd see his
          eyes twirling like pinwheels.
          Mrs. Blase brings the fries.

          MRS. BLASE
          The only reason I'm giving you
          these French fries is because
          you promised to calm down.
          Don't expect to get them
          again.
          Mr. Blase is still annoyed by Dave's music.

          MR. BLASE
          I can't eat while that noise
          is on.
          He gets up and heads toward Dave's room. Dave appears
          dressed for riding. They cross paths. Mrs. Blase goes to
          wash the pan in the sink. Dave sees the French fries on - X
          the table. He sits down and starts eating them. The
          music stops. Mrs. Blase turns around and sees Dave eating
          the French fries. She wants to say something. Mr. Blase
          reappears and sees Dave eating his fries.

          Oh, Mama...
          Mrs. Blase is frightened.

          food into a bag: cheeses, sausage, the rest of the eggs in
          the carton...bacon. Mr. Blase looks at her.

          He's elated. A huge grin breaks in his salt-covered face,
          and he reaches for his water bottle and sprays his head with
          it as if it were victory champagne. Ahead of him we see
          the Marlboro Man billboard.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF BLOOMINGTON - DAY 58-A

          Mr. Blase is driving one of the "fanciest" cars off his lot.

          (NOTE: AN OLD LINCOLN OR A CADDY WOULD BE JUST FINE.)

          INT. CAR

          Mr: Blase is dressed neatly. He's wearing a jacket and & .tie
          although it's hot and he's sweating.

          EXT. WOOLRIDGE QUARRY SHOP - DAY 58-B

          Mr. Blase pulls into the parking lot and gets out. He looks
          at the shop. The NOISE of MACHINERY is HEARD from the huge
          building. The NOISE gets LOUDER as Mr. Blase walks toward
          it, trying to avoid stepping into the Limestone dust with his
          polished shoes, but the dust is everywhere.

          EXT. SHOP ENTRANCE 58-C

          Several CUTTERS are having lunch. They are eating heartily
          right outside the shop. The NOISE is EVEN LOUDER but they
          don't seem to be bothered by it. One of them looks.

                         CUTTER ONE
          Well, look who's back.
          He has to shout to be heard. The others look.

          ANGLE ON MR. BLASE
          He's glad to be back but he's also trying to keep a little
          distance as if proud of how far he had come in life. He
          smiles and waves grandly, his suit and tie sticking out in
          this surrounding.

          They all laugh and get up to greet him. All except one
          younger man who continues sitting and eating. The Cutters
          slap Mr. Blase on the back, their dusty hands leaving dusty
          imprints on his jacket.

                         CVITER THREE

          visiting. But if I wanted to
          come back I could pick up where
          I left off.
          The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the
          Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one
          of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts
          are coming back.

                         YOUNG CUTTER
          Who's he?
          Mr. Blase looks back over his shoulder hurt by this remark.

          I . SHOP DAY
          The NOISE is now DEAFENING. Dust is everywhere and slowly
          through the dust we see men working, pausing only long enough
          to smile and wave at Mr. Blase. Mr. Blase is finishing off
          his sandwich just like the Cutter next to him who walks to
          his place leaving Mr. Blase, who has no place here, to wonder.

          is the new star on the college team.

                         MIRE
          Looks like he left.
          The trio starts heading toward the revolving door. They pass
          Rod's GIRL. She's sitting alone. Cyril stops.

                         CYRIL
          And what's your major?

                         GIRL
          Sash.
          Rod shows up carring a tray of drinks. Cyril looks up.
          Mike sees him. It's clear he wishes he didn't. Moocher
          resigns himself to the inevitable. Starts wrapping a
          handkerchief around his fist. Cyril is cringing.

          What're you cutters doing here?
          Did you get lost.
          No.

                         ROD
          Then why don't you get lost now.

                         CYRIL
          Oops. I feel like that cartoon
          again.
          A bunch of Rod's cronies sitting nearby-laughs. They crowd
          in around the cutters. Cyril and Moocher look at Mike for
          guidance. Mike is on the spot. It's not that he's afraid
          of a fight, it's just that he's on a foreign turf.

                         MIIE
          Is,..is that him, Cyril?
          Cyril gets the cue.-

          Let's get out of here.

                         ROD
          Smart move, shorty.
          This is all Moocher needs. He hits Rod right in the tray
          Spilling the drinks all over him. Rod falls back knocking
          the table down. His friends jump up to his aid. Our guys
          are surrounded. The only opening is the cafeteria line.
          Mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates,
          saucers, cups. Cyril is swinging the bowling ball around
          himself for protection. More rows of plates fall as the
          ball hits-them. The College Guys, led by Rod are trying to
          advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food
          at them. The College Guys are throwing back what they can.
          Cyril's ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach.
          By now its a free-for-all.

          INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - ROD - DAY

          He's well-dressed. Jacket and tie. The CAMERA PULLS BACK.
          A dozen other student "leaders" are there. One of them is
          black. The PRESIDENT is at his desk. On his far right we
          see Mike's brother sitting alone.

                         PRESIDENT
          Most of you will only spend four
          years here but to a lot of us
          Bloomington is our home and .1
          don't like the way you are behaving
          in my home. These needless
          hostilities have happened before.
          They will not happen again. If
          you feel compelled to compete with
          the kids from the town then you
          will do it in a different arena.
          I am looking at a plan to open
          our intramural program to them.
          And as a starting point, in
          consultation with Mr. Armstrong,
          we have decided to expand the
          field of this year's Little 500
          to include a team from the town.
          A loud protest is heard from everybody.

                         ROD -
          But, sir, they're not good enough...
          Having them in the race...

                         BLACK GUY

                         (INTERRUPTS)
          The whole thing reeks of
          tokenism.
          Everybody, even Rod, looks at him. It's sort of like: What
          are you talking about.

          Mr. Blase with a CUSTOMER and his Family. The car stalls.

          Mike stands up. He's ready to walk away. He pauses
          suddenly... On the other side of the quarry he sees Rod
          and his group. Dave sees Katherine and without making it
          obvious to the others leans back behind a rock.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Mike is looking at Rod. Rod sees him and just stands there.
          His friends, Katherine included, seem to be trying to get
          him to leave. But he doesn't. Mike feels the eyes of his
          gang on him. He gestures to Rod to come in the water. Mike
          runs up his rock and dives in. Rod dives off his side.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The two of them are swimming toward each other.

          They are side-by-side. Rod is smiling. Mike takes off
          toward one end of the quarry swimming as fast as he can.
          Rod lets him go. Looks up at his friends and takes off
          after hiu. Mike is splashing clumsily but going as hard
          as he can. Rod is smooth and powerful. He catches up to
          Mike. He changes from breaststroke to backstroke. It's
          all so easy for him.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's staying out of sight of Katherine. He's feeling quite
          badly for having to hide.

          Rod has reached the "all of the quarry and is waiting. Mike
          reaches the wal?...a:rhausted and starts back again. Rod
          seems amused. He thc,3ght the race was over. He takes off

          ON THE RACE
          Mike seems to be half-drowning. He can't see where he's
          going. He's no longer swimming in a straight line. His head
          is bleeding and he's running into the edges of the quarry.
          Hitting them with his hands. His hands are bleeding too.

          He's swimming in a total daze. Blood is dripping down his
          face. Dave is swimming toward him. Moocher and Cyril are
          behind Dave.
          Mike's arms go around Dave's neck. He's smiling a little
          through his pain. As he relaxes he lets his weight-sink
          on Dave and Dave sinks under water.

          EXT. MR. BLASE CAR LOT - DAY 129

          Mr. Blase is standing in front of the Homecoming Queen.- He's
          got his hands on the hood and is pushing. The KID who
          bought it is at the other end with his friends. They are
          pushing the other way.

          MR. BLASE
          What guarantee?

                         SZD
          You gave me your word.

          MR. BLASE
          On paper? Can I see it on
          paper?

                         KID
          There was no paper. You gave
          me your word.

          MR. BLASE
          I don't remember giving my word.
          (pushes on the car)
          Now get this car out of here.
          Dave appears next to him.

          You did, Papa. You gave him
          your word. I heard you. We
          are poor, but we're honest.
          Mr. Blase is stunned.

          MR. BLASE
          What? Who're you?
          He starts to push real hard.

                         KID
          All I want is a refund.

          MR. BLASE

                         REFUNDI REFUNDL

                         (REALLY STARTS

                         PUSHING HARD)
          Are you crazy? Refundl
          He's getting very red in the face. Hess pushing for all he's
          worth. The Kids are pushing the other way. Mr. Blase
          becomes a fanatic. His veins are swelling on his neck. The
          world becomes'all blurred through his eyes, but he pushes.

          MR. BLASE

                         RE-FUNDL RE-FUNDL
          Suddenly the world starts to spin for him. He clutches his
          chest. He's ready to fall backwards, but with the last gasp
          of willpower, he gets himself to collapse forward on top of
          the hood.

          INT. MR'. BLASE' S BEDROOM - DAY 130

          A DOCTOR is listening to his heart with a stethoscope.
          Mr. Blase is in a coma of sorts. He's muttering something.
          It sounds very much like "Refund...no refund." The Doctor
          prepares an injection.

          INT. THE KITCHEN 131

          Mrs. Blase and Dave are sitting at the table. The Doctor
          comes out of the bedroom. Dave and Mrs. Blase stand up.

                         DOCTOR
          Well, it's not a stroke, and

          Seriously, Evelyn. He's in
          terrible shape. He's a Mack
          truck with Rabbit engine.
          Once he's up on his feet he
          better start using them...
          walking... exercising... something.
          Otherwise it's taps city for

          He exits. Dave looks guilty.

                         DAVE
          I ruined everything.

          MRS. BLASE
          No, you didn't. He needed a
          rest and now he's getting one.

                         DAVE
          I don't think I'll go to the
          race. I should be here when
          Papa wakes up.

          1 RS . BLASE
          No, I don't think you should.
          Here, did I ever show you this.
          She takes a passport out of her purse on the table.

                         DAVE
          It's a passport.

          MRS. BLASE
          They're quite cheap, you know.
          A real bargain. I eep carrying
          it with me. One of these days
          there'll be a new girl at the
          IGA and when I want to cash a
          check she'll ask me for some
          Indentification and I'll take
          out my passport and say: Here.
          Won't that be something.
          Dave is moved by this gesture: By the spirit of yearning for
          travel that it implies and by the knowledge that she will
          probably not go anywhere.

                         ANNOUNCER
          We are proud to have with us
          today the famous Team Cinzano
          from Italy. They are touring
          America and so far are undefeated.
          Later on they have been kind
          enough to agree to hold a racing
          clinic which none of you should
          miss.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's in the crowd of other racers and like all of them, his
          eyes are glued on the Italians.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Dave is putting a banana and an apple in the back pocket of
          his Jersey. Other riders are doing likewise. Almost all
          of them are taking bananas.

          We see all kinds of legs. Some are milky white. Others are
          tanned. Some are long and skinny. Others short and bulging
          with muscles.

          MONTAGE OF POSTERIORS
          One after another, we see, the riders' rears meet the saddles
          of their bicycles.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's in the middle of the pack. He looks over his shoulder
          and waves to Mike, Cyril and Moocher on the sideline.

          CLOSEUP - THE ITALIANS
          They are in the front. They are looking straight ahead.

          We see the pack from the back as it moves forward slowly and
          then faster, and faster, the riders in the back working their
          way up.

                         LONG SHOT
          The huge pack of riders is now disappearing around a bend in
          the road.

                         TRUCKING SHOT 134
          We PICK UP the last rider in the field and MOVE PAST him.
          There are stragglers already: individuals and little groups,
          and then a large group. We MOVE PAST them TOWARD:

          ANGLE ON THE LEAD GROUP
          The Italians, Dave and half a dozen other riders are in the
          lead group. They are separated from the rest by about half
          a mile. Some riders in the group are eating their bananas.
          Others are drinking water. They are approaching a hill. The
          Italians shift their gears and like clockwork the rest of the
          riders do the same. The Italians start sprinting up the hill
          The others pursue. Strain is showing on everybody.

                         LONG SHOT
          We see the pack climbing the hill.

          ANGLE ON CREST OF THE HILL
          The Italians appear first.. They look back over their
          shoulders and see nobody there. They nod to each other and
          continue over the crest, shifting into a higher gear for the
          descent. Dave and three riders appear over the crest. Dave
          is in the lead. As he goes over the crest, he shifts gears
          and starts to sprint. The other riders cannot match him.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON ITALIANS
          They are bent over their frames in their descent positions.
          Their knees and elbows are tucked in and they are coasting
          down the hill.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON DAVE
          He's in the similar position only he's not coasting. He's

          ANGLE ON THE ITALIANS
          They are still in their descent. The hill is steep and they
          are going very fast. Suddenly, Dave, bent over and breathing
          hard appears in the FRAME. He tries to appear that he's not
          tired. He smiles.

                         DAVE
          Buon giorno. Come sta?
          The Italians look stunned. The 1ST ITALIAN is annoyed. The
          ZTH ITALIAN seems amused.

                         CUT TO:

          FRONT SHOT - THE FLATS 135
          The Italians are riding hard. The effort is showing on their
          faces. Dave is behind them. He too is tired. But when the
          1st Italian looks back to see how Dave is doing Dave manages
          to smile. This seems to "psyche" the lst Italian out. He
          gestures angrily to Dave to take his turn up front. Dave is
          thrilled at the command. He moves to the front. The
          following conversations will have to be subtitled.

                         DAVE
          Oggi fa caldo, none vero?

          hard and he's tired. The Italians behind him are likewise.
          Dave swings off to let another rider pull in front. As he
          does Dave once again smiles. He doesn't do this to fool
          them. He's just thrilled to be in their company.

          But the lst Italian is upset. He wants to drop Dave. But
          he doesn't want to kill himself doing it. He's thinking.

          FADE THROUGH TO:

          ANGLE ON THE HILL 136
          The Italians are switching off as they begin another ascent.
          It's Dave's turn to take the lead. As he goes up front the
          1st Italian reaches in and pushes Dave's lever all the way
          forward. This suddenly shifts Dave into a very high gear.
          He can hardly turn the cranks. The 1st Italian smiles at him.

                         1ST ITALIAN

                         MI SCUSII
          (Excuse me!)
          He takes off. The other three follow him while Dave fumbles
          around to get back in the right gear.

          FADE THROUGH TO:

          CLOSEUP - THE 1ST ITALIAN
          He does not look happy. The CAMERA MOVES BACK and we SEE
          Dave at the front again.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's getting a little more serious. He sees a huge pothole
          in front of him. He rides right toward it and then at the
          last second he jerks his bike aside. The 1st Italian goes
          right over the pothole. He's jarred and angry. Dave looks
          back. Smiles.

                         DAVE
          Mi scusi!
          The 4th Italian appreciates this little reversal. The
          lst Italian is getting a brutal look in his face.

          All five of them are continually taking turns being up front.
          They are approaching a small hill. The lst Italian points
          to the hill. Dave is too exhausted now to fake any smiles.
          The pace is as hard as it's been.

          FADE THROUGH TO:

          ANGLE ON THE CREST OF THE HILL 139
          Dave is up front.
          Behind him we see the 2ND ITALIAN taking out his pump. Dave
          pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the
          lst Italian pulls up behind him to block his way back. The
          3RD ITALIAN sprints up front to block his way forward. Dave
          is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts
          on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down
          the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave
          sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees
          it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road
          falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The
          4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems
          genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues.
          He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.

                         4TH ITALIAN

          His left leg is hurt but more than that his dream seems
          shattered.

          EXT. RACE FINISH 140

          The tour Italians are sprinting toward the finish line. A
          large "FINISH" sign flutters in the breeze. The 4th Italian
          wins and as he does he turns and fives the "Italian finger"
          to his three buddies. He's still angry at them. Cyril,
          Mike and Moocher look for Dave. The crowd is cheering.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY 140-A

          All the guys are riding in silence. Dave is crushed by his
          shattered Italian dream. Mendelsohn's Italian Symphony is

          as well as himself and trying to get used to the new machine.
          He tries sprinting and in mid-spring he stops pedaling. His
          hand grasps his left leg. He's in pain. He drops his foot
          off the pedal and shakes his leg as-if trying to shake out
          a cramp.

          We see Moocher, Cyril and Mike. All of them are panicking.
          They seem to be pushing each other forward. Nobody wants
          to be the one to get on the bike. Into this panic Dave roars
          in with his bike. He slams on the brakes. Jumps off. His
          left leg gives way and he falls. Moocher and Cyril run to
          help him up. Mike is left holding the bike.

          going.
          But the crowd, the other riders staring at him, the pressure
          of the moment is too much for Mike. He just stands there.
          The lead that they had is evaporating. The other riders are
          catching up. They are coming around the curve. Moocher runs
          up to Mike, pushes him away and gets on the bike. His
          intentions are great, but his legs are short. He can't sit
          in the saddle and reach the pedals. So he stands and rides
          just as the other teams come around.

          Now all three riders are looking back over their shoulders.
          They see Dave coming on.

          Rod is getting ready to take an exchange for his final sprint.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          We see the black sprinter in Pit area 4 getting ready to take
          an exchange too. He and Rod look at each other.

          MED. SHOT
          Rod and. the black sprinter get their bikes at the same time
          and start to accelerate.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON DAVE-
          He passes the third rider from the lead group. Ahead of him
          he sees Rod and the black rider.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON THE LAP CHART
          It shows one lap to go. A man is waving a flag signaling the
          last lap. Rod and the black guy go past him. Dave is behind
          them and gaining.

          Rod and the black rider are riding abreast now.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON DAVE
          He sees them right in front of him. The Italian music is
          still playing as he catches up to them and pulls up behind
          Rod who's riding on the inside. They are going around the
          curve. Rod drifts out a bit and that's all the room that
          Dave needs. He takes the inside edge as they come around
          for the final stretch. All three of them stand up and begin
          their final sprint. It looks dead even as they're
          approaching the finish line. A man is waving the checkered
          flag. Then, with about forty yards to go, Dave suddenly
          explodes ahead and wins by an inch or so. He raises his arms
          in the air.

                         CUT TO:

                         NEW ANGLE
          Cyril, Moocher and Mike are running toward Dave. They are
          Jubilant. They jump on Dave knocking him down. Mike's'
          brother runs up and...

          CLOSEUP - THE BROTHERS
          There's a look of family pride as they embrace.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Nancy runs up to Moocher. She's still wearing her waitress
          uniform. She practically lifts him off the ground. Dave's
          parents rush past them. Everybody is shouting. The crowd
          is cheering. Confetti is falling.

          CLOSEUP - CYRIL
          He's happy but he feels left out. Everybody is hugging and
          'getting hugged except for him.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Katherine is watching the celebration. She looks at Dave and
          then she looks at Rod not far away. Then she turns slowly
          and leaves-bidding a farewell, in a way, to a portion of her
          life.

          going their way.

          CLOSEUP - CYRIL
          He's-holding the four trophies they won. He is trying to
          swagger but he doesn't know where to go. The guys seem to
          be going-in separate directions and he doesn't know whom to
          follow. The CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM him. Confetti is falling
          everywhere. Wind is blowing it around the stadium.

          FADE THROUGH TO:

          ANGLE ON TREES 178
          The branches are swaying in the wind. Leaves are golden
          yellow and falling off, swirling through the air, falling
          on the road. Mike's car goes through.the leaves as he drives
          up an entrance ramp onto a throughway.

          INT. MIL'S CAR - DAY 178-A

          He's wearing.a cowboy hat. Cigarette is in his. mouth. He
          looks back at a sign: "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING BLOOMINGTON."
          He lights his cigarette. A highway stretches in front of him.

          EXT. MR. BLASE' S CAR LOT - DAY

          It's been retitled "CUTTER CARS LTD." Mrs. Blase, quite
          pregnant now, is sweeping the leaves. Mr. Blase is getting
          on the bike ready to leave.

          EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 179

          ,The leaves are falling off here too and blowing in the wind.
          Students are going to and from classes. We see Dave among
          them pushing his bike along. He's wearing a Phi Kappa Psi
          jacket.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He looks quite collegiate and he seems to know it. But it's
          fall and fall makes you think of other days and Dave seems
          to be doing just that. A GIRL walks up to him. She seems
          quite lost. She speaks with a definite French accent.

                         GIRL
          Pardon...do you know where is
          the office of the Pursar.
          Dave looks at her. Some of his collegiate exterior fades as
          he smiles at her.

          He's riding through the campus, looking around. His son goes

          there.

          ANGLE ON DAVE AND THE GIRL
          They're riding double on Dave's bicycle. She's carrying his
          books. The book on top is Beginning French.

                         DAVE
          French is my major. It's just my
          first year, of course. Have you
          ever seen Le Tour de France?

          He gives it his best French accent.

                         GIRL
          No.

          French riders... they are the
          bestl Pouladoirl Anquetill

          Not only his accent, but his gestures are becoming French.
          Riding toward him on his bike is Mr. Blase. He sees Dave
          and waves.

          MR. BLASE
          Hello there, big shot.

                         DAVE
          Bon jour, Papa.
          They pass.
          Mr. Blase turns and looks back. His face registers mixed
          emotions, but the overriding one is one of acceptance. Dave
          turns to the girl.

                         DAVE

          We FREEZE ON his French gesture.

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
	restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
	door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
	state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
	inside as we SUPER:

		KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963

	INT. TRUCK - DAY

	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

				GERALD
		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

				TOM
		No.  Not even you.

				GERALD
		Why so glum?

				TOM
		I don't know.

				GERALD
			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

				TOM
		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

				GERALD
		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

				TOM
		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

				GERALD
		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

				TOM
		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

				GERALD
		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

				TOM
		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

				TOM
		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

				GERALD
		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

				TOM
		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

				TOM
		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

				GERALD
			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

				TOM
			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)
		It better help.  What can you do with
		yourself if all you do is look good?

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

	AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
	rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

				AARON
		...and finally to the teachers of
		Whitman High School, I don't have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the English Department here than 
		my own limitations...

	He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort.

				AARON
		...that was, of course, not meant to
		be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
		I am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from High School two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it.
		If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
		I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

	ANGLE ON TEACHERS

				MALE TEACHER
		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

	ANGLE ON STAGE

	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

				YOUTH #1
		Later, Aaron.

	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

	CLOSER IN

	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

				AARON
		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

				AARON
		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

				AARON
		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

				JANE
			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

	OTHER ANGLE

	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

				JANE
			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

				FATHER
			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

				JANE
		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

				FATHER
		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

				JANE
		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

				FATHER
		You don't have to finish tonight.

				JANE
			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

				FATHER
		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

				JANE
		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

				AARON
		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		Good Morning America, the
		Morning News and Today are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

				JANE
		A half hour in the lobby.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	INT. BUS STATION - DAY

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

				AARON
		Ready.
 
				CAMERAMAN
		Your hair's a little funny.

				AARON
		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

				CAMERAMAN
		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

				AARON
		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

				CAMERAMAN
		Okay.

	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

				AARON
		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

				AARON
		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

				CAMERAMAN
		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

				AARON
		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

	INT. GATE AREA - DAY

	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

				J.D.
		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

				AARON
		Just a few questions?

				J.D.
		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

				AARON
		We came from Washington.

				J.D.
		Move away from me.

				AARON
			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

				J.D.
			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

				AARON
		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

				JANE
		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

				AARON
		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

				JANE
		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

				AARON
			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

				J.D.
			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

				JANE
		I love that turn away.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

				JANE
			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

				WOMAN
			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
	A WOMAN in blackness.

				WOMAN THREE
			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

				JANE
		Please don't applaud.

	ON AUDIENCE

	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

				JANE
		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's WRONG with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

				JANE
		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

				JANE
		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

	TRACKING SHOT

	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

				JANE
		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

	SHOT CONTINUES

	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

	ON JANE

	Briefly departing from text.

				JANE
		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

				TOM
		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

	BACK TO JANE

	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

				JANE
		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

	ON MONITORS

	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

	ON SCENE

	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

				JANE
			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

	OTHER ANGLE

	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

				TOM
		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

	ANGLE ON TOM

	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

				JANE
		Hi.

				TOM
		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

				JANE
			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

				TOM
		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

				JANE
		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

				JANE
		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

				TOM
		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

				TOM
		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

				JANE
			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

				TOM
		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

				TOM
		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

				JANE
		If we could just eat first.

				TOM
		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

				JANE
		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

				JANE
		Thank you.

	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

				JANE
		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

				TOM
		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

				TOM
		That actually goes on...

				JANE
		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

				TOM
		Yes, sure.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

				TOM
		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

				TOM
		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

				JANE
			(levelly)
		I trust you.

				TOM
		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

				TOM
		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

				TOM
		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

				JANE
		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

				TOM
		One year...almost one year.

				JANE
		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

				TOM
		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

				JANE
		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

				TOM
		Uh-huh.

				JANE
			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

				TOM
		Whoa, this was a mistake.

				JANE
		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

				JANE
		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

				TOM
		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She is on the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As he talks with Jane.

				AARON
			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

				JANE
		Why do you say that?

				AARON
		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

				AARON
		Okay.  Let's do me.

				JANE
		Sure.

				AARON
		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

				JANE
		This conversation is not worthy of you.

				AARON
		I'd give anything if that were true.

				JANE
			(laughing)
		Good night.

				AARON
		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

				JANE
		Call if you get weird.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

				JANE
			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH

	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

				TOM
		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

				JANE
			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

	INTERCUT:

	ON TOM

				TOM
		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

				JANE
		What???

	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

				AARON
		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the Times and he had a great
		audition tape.

				JANE
		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Tom arrives for first day of work.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

				JANE
			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

				BOBBIE
		We could...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

				TOM
		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

				TOM
		They said it would be okay if...

				JANE
			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

				JANE
		Play back the last line...

				BOBBIE
		He said something about...

				JANE
			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

				BLAIR
		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

	TOM

	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

				MERCENARY
			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

				JANE
		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

				BLAIR
		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

				BLAIR
		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

				JANE
		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

				BOBBIE
		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				AARON
		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

				AARON
		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

				KLEIN
		Sure.

				JENNIFER
		Why not?

				ERNIE
		Absolutely.

				GEORGE
		You bet.

				AARON
		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

				BLAIR
		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

				ERNIE
		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

				BLAIR
		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

				AARON
		What is she shooting?

				BLAIR
		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

				AARON
			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

				JANE
		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

				BOBBIE
		Should I...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

				BLAIR
			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

				AARON
		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a Homecoming  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

				BLAIR
		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

				BLAIR
		In 84 seconds?

	ON CLOCK

	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

				JANE
			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

				AARON
		Eleven and a half.

				JANE
		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

				BLAIR
		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

	ON CLOCK

	42 seconds away.

				BLAIR
		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

				BOBBIE
		Whoops.

				BLAIR
			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

				AARON
		Shit, shit, shit...

				TOM
			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

				BOBBIE
		Ready.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

				BLAIR
		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

				AARON
		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

	ON MONITOR

	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

				BILL
			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

				JENNIFER
		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
		liked it.

				AARON
		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

				BLAIR
		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

				BLAIR
		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

				ERNIE
		I saw the smile -- good piece.

				AARON
		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

				TOM
		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

				JANE
			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

				TOM
		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

				JANE
		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

				TOM
		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

				JANE
		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

				TOM
		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

				JANE
		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

				TOM
		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

				JANE
		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

				AARON
		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

				JANE
		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

				AARON
		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

				JANE
		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

	ANGLE ON

	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

				CAMERAMAN
		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

				JANE
		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

				TOM
		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

				CONCIERGE
		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

				AARON
		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

				AARON
		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

				JANE
		Let's tape.

				CAMERAMAN
			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

				JANE
		That's okay.

	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

				AARON
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

				AARON
		Did you shoot their boots?

				JANE
		Of course.

				AARON
		We can cut back at the end.

				JANE
		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

				AARON
		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

				REPORTER
		I think he's coming out now.

				TOM
			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

				TOM
			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

	ON TOM

	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

				CAMERAMAN
			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

				TOM
		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

				CAMERAMAN
		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

				JANE
		Are you all packed and ready?

				CAMERAMAN
		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

				JANE
		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

	ON TELEVISION MONITORS

	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

				BLAIR
		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

				ERNIE
		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

	ON JANE

	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

				TOM
		Hi.

				JANE
		How's it going?

				TOM
		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

				JANE
			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

				TOM
		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

				BLAIR
		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

	ON MONITOR

	We see Bill Rorish.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Jane?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		But thanks.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

				JANE
		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

				JANE
			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

				TOM
			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

				AARON
		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

				AARON
		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

				BLAIR
		What did he say?

				JANE
			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

				BUDDY
		Could I see how I photograph?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Huh?  Sorry?

				BUDDY
		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

				AARON
		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		That's your full name?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

				BUDDY
		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

				AARON
		Eventually rising to...

				BUDDY
		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

				AARON
		Eventually rising to?

				BUDDY

		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

				BUDDY
		I don't like the word gay.

				AARON
		Which would you prefer?

				BUDDY
		Ravenous homosexual.

				AARON
		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

				BUDDY
			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

				BUDDY
		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

				TOM
		No, I don't think so.

				BUDDY
		How do I get out of here?

				TOM
		Follow me.

				BUDDY
			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

				GUARD
		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

				BUDDY
		I'm leaving.

				TOM
			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

				BUDDY
		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

				TOM
		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

				BUDDY
		Is there a regular bar around here?

	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

				TOM
		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

				BUDDY
		Bad manners.

				TOM
		Yes.  That's right.

				BUDDY
		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

				TOM
		No...no.

				BUDDY
		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

				TOM
		I really have to go.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

				TOM
		What?

				BUDDY
		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

				TOM
		Yes.  How do you know?

				BUDDY
			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

				GEORGE
		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

				ERNIE
			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

				TOM
		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

				GEORGE
			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

				TOM
		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

				ERNIE
		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

				BOBBIE
		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

				JANE
		No stop where he's all besieged.

				BOBBIE
		Because...

				JANE
			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

				TOM
		So he was indicted?

				JANE
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		We were right not to go with it.

				TOM
		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

				JANE
			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

				TOM
		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

				BOBBIE
			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

				JANE
		Bobbie, please.

	INT. METRO BUS - DAY

	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

				BUDDY
		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

				TOM
		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

				BUDDY
			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

				TOM
		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

				BUDDY
		I see the change in you -- I see it.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
	network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
	steers her outside.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

				JENNIFER
		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

				TOM
		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

				JENNIFER
		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

				TOM
		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

				JENNIFER
		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a
		great tour.

	INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
	her story.

				JENNIFER
			(voice over; on TV set)
		The President says it's not a violation
		but nonetheless White House sources
		say the full price will be paid for the
		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

				BUDDY
		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

				TOM
		Nobody else had it.

				BUDDY
		I wish it were you giving the story.

				TOM
		That's okay.

				BUDDY
		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

				TOM
		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

				TOM
		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
	RAPTURE.

				BUDDY
		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

				TOM
		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

				BUDDY
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

				JANE
		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

				TOM
		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

				TOM
		I've got another story.

				JANE
		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

				TOM
		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

				JANE
		Billion.

				TOM
		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		You write this?

				JANE
		I write for you sometimes.

				AARON
		Not because you have to.

	ON MONITOR

	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

				GENERAL
		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

				TOM
		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

	ON TOM

	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

				BLAIR
		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

				AARON
		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

				JANE
		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

				BLAIR
		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

				ERNIE
		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

				TOM
		Hi, Ellie.

				ERNIE
		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

				AARON
			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

				ELLIE
		I'm sorry -- from where?

				AARON
		I've been to your house a lot...

				ERNIE
			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

				ELLIE
			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

	Tom is on the phone.

				TOM
			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

				BLAIR
		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

				BLAIR
		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

				GREY HAIRED MAN
			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

				BLAIR
		Goodbye, Paul.

				AARON
		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

				BLAIR
		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

				AARON
		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

				BLAIR
		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

				AARON
		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

	ON JANE

	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

				JENNIFER
		This is very awkward.

				JANE
		Go ahead -- what?

				JENNIFER
		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

				JANE
		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

				JENNIFER
		You're saying stay away from him.

				JANE
			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

				JENNIFER
		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

				GEORGE WELN
		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

				ERNIE'S WIFE
			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

				JANE
			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

				TOM
		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

				JANE
		What do you mean clean?

				TOM
		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

				JANE
		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

				TOM
		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

				JANE
		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

	ON AARON AND ERNIE

				ERNIE
		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

				AARON
		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

				ERNIE
		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

				ANNE
		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

				ANNE
		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

	ON JANE

	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

				JANE
		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

	ON STAIRCASE

	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

				JANE
		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

				JENNIFER
		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

				JENNIFER
		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

	FULL SCENE

	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

				ERNIE
		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

				ERNIE
			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

				JANE
		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

				ERNIE
		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

				JANE
		Let's figure out the field.

				ERNIE
		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

				AARON
		That's it.  I resign as of now.

				ERNIE
			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

				AARON
		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

				JANE
		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

				ERNIE
		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

	ON JANE

	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

				TOM
		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

				JANE
		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

				PAUL
		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

				JANE
		It's not opinion.

				PAUL
		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

				PAUL
		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

				JANE
			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

				JANE
			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

				AARON
		What happened?

				JANE
		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

				AARON
		Watch? --

				JANE
		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

				AARON
		Yeah, love you, too.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

	As it moves off.

				JANE
		Nervous?

				TOM
		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

				JANE
		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

				BLAIR
		And Bobbie says...

				JANE
		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

				BLAIR
			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

				JANE
		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

				JANE
		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

				JANE
		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

				GRAPHIC ARTIST
		We have no pictures on file.

				JANE
		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

				GUARD
		I have to check first.

				BUDDY
			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

				BUDDY
		Is everything all right?

				TOM
		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

				BUDDY
			(delighted)
		Anchor?

				TOM
			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

				BUDDY
		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

				TOM
		Oh.

				BUDDY
		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

				TOM
		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

				BUDDY
		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

				TOM
		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

				BUDDY
			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

				TOM
		I'll speak to you.

				BUDDY
		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

				BLAIR
			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

				JANE
		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

				TOM
			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

				TOM
		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

				MAN ONE
		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

				PAUL
		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

				TOM
		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

				AARON
			(SINGING LOUDLY)
		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

	ON TV

	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

	INT. BOOTH

	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

				JANE
		George, you're ready.

	ON PENTAGON MONITOR

	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

				GEORGE
			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

				JANE
		Cover everything!

	George nods.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

	ON TOM

				TOM
		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

				AARON
		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	As Blair hands it to Jane.

				BLAIR
		It's Aaron.

				JANE
		Yes?

				AARON
		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

				JANE
		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

				TOM
		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

				GEORGE
		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

				AARON
		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

				AARON
			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

	ON JANE

				JANE
		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

				AARON
			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

				AARON
		Nice, Jane.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

	ON TOM

	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

	BACK TO JANE

	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

				JANE
		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

				PAUL
			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

				TOM
			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

				TOM
		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

				TOM'S VOICE
		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

				PAUL
		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

				ERNIE
			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

				JANE
		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

				JANE
		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

				PAUL
			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

				PAUL
			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

				TOM
		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

				ERNIE
			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

				MARVIN
		We're here to play the new news theme.

				ERNIE
		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

				PAUL
		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

				MAN ONE
		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

				PAUL
		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

				ERNIE
		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

				TOM
		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

				JANE
			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

				TOM
		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

				TOM
		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

				JANE
		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

				TOM
		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

				JANE
			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

				TOM
		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

				TOM
		Jane?

				JANE
		Yeah?

				TOM
		I'll wait for you till seven.

				JANE
			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

	ON AARON

	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

				JANE
		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

				JANE
		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

				AARON
		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

				AARON
		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

				JANE
		Well, whatever you think.

				AARON
		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

				JANE
		Sounds like you may be on to something.

				AARON
		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

				JANE
		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

				AARON
		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

				JANE
		Yes.

				AARON
		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

				AARON
		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	ON JANE

	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

	INT. CAB - EVENING

				JANE
		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

				JANE
		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

				DRIVER
		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

				JANE
		Thanks -- good driving --

				DRIVER
		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

				JANE
		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

				TOM
		I didn't think you'd make it.

				JANE
		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

				TOM
		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

				JANE
		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

				JANE
		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

				JENNIFER
			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

				JANE
			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

				TOM
		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

				JENNIFER
			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

				JENNIFER
		Sorry.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

				TOM
		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

				JENNIFER
		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

				TOM
			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

				JENNIFER
		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

				JENNIFER
		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

				TOM
		Where's the bathroom?

				JENNIFER
		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

				JENNIFER
		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

				TOM
		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

				JENNIFER
		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

				TOM
		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

				AARON
		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

				JANE
		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

				JANE
		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

				AARON
		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

				BLAIR
		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

				JANE
			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

				PAUL
		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

				JANE
			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

				JANE
		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

				TOM
		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

				JANE
			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

				JANE
		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

				TOM
		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

				JANE
		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
		Is it safe for me to fly home?

				TOM
		Yes.  We're fine now.

				JANE
		AND SMILE.

	He smiles -- people smile back.

				JANE
		AND MOVE.

	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

				AARON
		Who the heck could that be?

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

	ON AARON

	And now he sees that it's Tom.

				AARON
		Is God testing me or something?

				MARTIN KLEIN
		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

				AARON
		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

				TOM
		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

				AARON
		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

				TOM
		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

				AARON
		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

				TOM
		What did I do to you?

				AARON
		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

				TOM
			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

				AARON
			(several beats; then)
		How you doing?

				TOM
			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

				AARON
		Keep it to yourself.

				TOM
		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

				AARON
		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

				AARON
		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

				TOM
		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

				AARON
			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

				TOM
		Shut up a second...

				AARON
			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

				TOM
			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

				AARON
		And the rule was...

				TOM
		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

				AARON
		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

				TOM
			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

				AARON
		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

				AARON
			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

				TOM
		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

				AARON
		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

				TOM
		Yes.

				AARON
		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

				TOM
		You're feeling good, aren't you?

				AARON
			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

				TOM
			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

	LONG SHOT

	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

				TOM
		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

				JANE
		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

				TOM
		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

				TOM
		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

				JANE
		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

				TOM
			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

				JANE
		What?

				TOM
		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

				JANE
		Well, what is it?

				TOM
		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

				TOM
		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

				TOM
		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

	ON TOM

	His spirits lifted.

	ON JANE

	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

				JANE
		Hello.

				TO
			(uncertain)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Hello...Who is it?

	INTERCUT:

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

				JANE
		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

				TOM
		Yes.

				JANE
		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

				TOM
		It's not important.

				JANE
		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

				TOM
		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

				JANE
		Nooo.  Is it your story?

				TOM
		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

				JANE
		Why, you need me for the story?

				TOM
		No.  Were you going to you?

				JANE
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

				JANE
		Oh, good.

				TOM
		We can go together.


				JANE
		So you like me, huh?

				TOM
		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

				TOM
			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

				BOBBIE
		Yes, and thanks for asking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

	ON MONITOR

				UNIFORMED COP
		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

				YOUNG WOMAN
		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

	ON NEWSROOM

	As Aaron enters the scene.

				AARON
		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

	ON MONITOR

				YOUNG WOMAN
		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

	ON MONITOR

	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

	ON NEWSROOM

	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

				AARON
		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

				TOM
			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

	NEWSROOM

	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

				AARON
		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

				TOM
		What's wrong with it?

				AARON
		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

	MONITOR

	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

	ON JANE

	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

	ON TOM AND JANE

	Now off a bit by themselves.

				TOM
		So what did you think?

				JANE
		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

				TOM
			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				JENNIFER
		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

				BLAIR
		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

				ERNIE
		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

				AARON
			(puzzled)
		Outside?

				ERNIE
		Yeah --

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

				ERNIE
		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

				AARON
		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

				ERNIE
			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

				AARON
		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

				ERNIE
		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

				AARON
		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

				ERNIE
		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

				ERNIE
		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

				AARON
		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

				ERNIE
		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

				AARON
			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

				ERNIE
		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

				AARON
			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

				ERNIE
		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

				AARON
		Do it then.

				ERNIE
		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

				AARON
		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

				ERNIE
		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

				AARON
		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

				ERNIE
		I understand.  I'll go with you.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

				AARON
		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

				TOM
		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

				AARON
		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

				TOM
		Wait.

				AARON
		What?

				TOM
		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

				TOM
		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

				AARON
			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

				TOM
		Sit on it!  Now look.

				AARON
		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

				TOM
		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

				AARON
		It's not loaded.

				TOM
		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

				TOM
		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

				AARON
		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

				AARON
		I'm very appreciative.

	SAME SCENE - LATER

	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

				TOM
		No.  No.

				AARON
		No?

				TOM
		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

				AARON
		Oh, God, no!

				TOM
		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

				TOM
		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

				AARON
		Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

				TOM
		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

				TOM
		You were smokin' toward the end there.

				AARON
		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

				TOM
		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

				AARON
		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

				AARON
		I didn't know you were going with him.

				JANE
		Did you bring your grey suit?

				AARON
		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

				JANE
			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

				JANE
		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

				AARON
		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

				JANE
			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

				JANE
			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

				JANE
		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

				AARON
		Really?

	Jane nods.

				AARON
		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

				JANE
		As good as humanly possible.

				AARON
		Yes.

				JANE
		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

				AARON
		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

				JANE
		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

				AARON
		If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

				JANE
		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

				AARON
		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

				JANE
		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

				AARON
		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

	INT. CAB - NIGHT

	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

				MAN ONE
		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

				MAN THREE
		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

				WOMAN
		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

				MAN
		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

	ON JANE

	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

	ON TOM

	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

	ON JANE

	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

	ON TOM

	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

				TOM
			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

				JANE
		Who?

				TOM
		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

				AARON
		Want to look at this?

				W.N.P.
		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

				GEORGE
			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

				AARON
			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

				GEORGE
		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

				W.N.P.
		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

				AARON
		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

				W.N.P.
		Sure.  You'll be fine.

				AARON
			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

				TOM
		How you doing, Paul?

				PAUL
		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

				TOM
		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

				PAUL
		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

				JANE
		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

				TOM
		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

				JANE
		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

				TOM
		Jane.

	She turns.

				TOM
		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

				JANE
		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

	ON TOM

	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

	FULL SHOT

	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten.

				AARON
		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

				AARON
			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Gee whiz.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

				AARON
		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

				AARON
		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

				AARON
		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

				AARON
		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Someone finds me some big towels.

	ON AARON

	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	ON MAKEUP WOMAN

	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

				DIRECTOR
		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

				TECHNICIAN
			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is more than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Can't you just die for him?

	ON MONITOR

	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Great.

	FULL SHOT

	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

				TOM
			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

				JANE
		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

				JANE
		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

				TOM
			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

				JANE
		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

				JANE
		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

				TOM
		Because you're nuts.

				JANE
		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

				TOM
		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

				JANE
		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

				TOM
		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

				JANE
			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

				TOM
		What?

				JANE
		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

				TOM
		That's not it.

				JANE
		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

				JANE
		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

				JANE
			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

				JANE
		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

				TOM
		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

				JANE
		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

				TOM
		JANE!

	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

				JANE
		What happened?

				TOM
		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

				JANE
		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

				TOM
		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

				JANE
		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

				AARON
		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				JANE
		How'd it go?

				AARON
		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

				JANE
		No.

				AARON
		Then it went well.

				JANE
		Did it really go well?

				AARON
		Define your terms.

				JANE
		Do you feel good about it?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Do others feel that you did well?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Then what was good about it?

				AARON
		I lost six pounds...

				JANE
		Aaron, will you tell me?

				AARON
		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

				JANE
		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

				AARON
		People phoned in.

				JANE
		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

				AARON
		I'm not kidding.

				JANE
		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

				AARON
		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

				JANE
		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

				AARON
		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

				JANE
		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

				JANE
		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

				AARON
		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

				JANE
			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

				AARON
			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

				AARON
		Don't go.

				JANE
		This is important to me.

				AARON
		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

				JANE
		What?

				AARON
			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

				AARON
		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

				JANE
			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

				AARON
		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

				JANE
		Yeah -- being a basket case.

				AARON
		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

				JANE
			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

				AARON
		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

				JANE
		I think you're the Devil.

				AARON
		No.  You know that I'm not.

				JANE
		How?

				AARON
		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

				JANE
		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

				AARON
		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

				AARON
			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

				JANE
			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

				AARON
		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	A woman walking from a car.

	ON TOM

	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

	INTERCUT:

	BACK TO SCENE

	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

				JANE
		Hi.  It's me.

				TOM
		Where are you?

				JANE
		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

				TOM
		Well, when?

				JANE
		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

				TOM
		I know.  I taped it.

				JANE
		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

				TOM
		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

				JANE
		Don't say anything about anything.

				AARON
		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

				TOM
		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

				AARON
		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

				TOM
		No.  Don't worry about it.

				AARON
		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

				JANE
		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

				TOM
		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

				JANE
		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

				TOM
		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

				JANE
			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

				TOM
			(finally)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Yes.

				TOM
		Okay.  Good night.

				JANE
			(aghast)
		Good night??!

				TOM
		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

				JANE
		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

				JANE
		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

				JANE
		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

				AARON
		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

				ERNIE
			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

				ERNIE
		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

				WIFE
		What?

				ERNIE
		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

				WIFE
			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

				BLAIR
		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

				BLAIR
		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

				JANE
		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

				BLAIR
		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The door now closed.

	JANE

	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

				TOM
		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

				JANE
			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

				TOM
		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

	TOM AND HIS DAD

				DAD
		You want my opinion?

				TOM
		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

				DAD
		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

				TOM
		Yes, I would.

				DAD
		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

				BILL
		Just when do you start, telling people?

				PAUL
		Almost immediately.

				BILL
		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

				PAUL
		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

				BILL
		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

				BLAIR
		Welcome back to Washington.

				BILL
		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

				BILL
		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

				BILL
		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

				PAUL
			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

				PAUL
		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

				BILL
		Hi.  It's about time.

				TOM
		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

	INSERT

	A great handshake.

	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

				TOM
		This is my father.

				BILL
		Good to meet you, sir.

	ON TOM

	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

				MR. GRUNICK
		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

				MR. GRUNICK
		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters...

				JANE
		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

				TOM
		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

				JANE
			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

				TOM
		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

				JANE
			(so softly)
		What?

				TOM
			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

				JANE
		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

				BLAIR
		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

				JANE
		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

				BOBBIE
		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

	INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

				SECRETARY
		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

				PAUL
		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

				PAUL
		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

				ANONYMOUS VOICE
		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

				TOM
		Have you guys seen Jane?

				ERNIE
		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

				AARON
		What did they do with you?

				TOM
		They booted me out of Washington.

				AARON
		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

				TOM
		Why?  What did they do to you?

				ERNIE
			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of
		him.

				AARON
		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

				ERNIE
		The cost-efficient reporter.

				AARON
		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

				TOM
		You packing up tonight?

				AARON
		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

				TOM
		London.

				AARON
			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

				TOM
			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

				AARON
		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

				TOM
		Hold it down, okay?

				AARON
		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

				TOM
		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

				AARON
		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

				AARON
		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

				TOM
			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

				TOM
		You know what I...

				AARON
		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

				OLDER SECRETARY
		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

				JANE
		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

				JANE
		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

				BLAIR
		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

				JANE
		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

				TOM
		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

				JANE
		How can you say that to me?

				TOM
		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

				JANE
		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

				TOM
		That's yes?

				JANE
		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings.  He answers.

				AARON
		Hello.

	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

				JANE
		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

				AARON
		Speaking.

				JANE
		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

				JANE
		Why not try it for a few weeks?

				AARON
		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

				JANE
		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

				AARON
		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

				JANE
		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

				AARON
		Let's go...

				JANE
		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

				AARON
		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

				JANE
		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

				AARON
		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

				JANE
			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

				AARON
		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

				JANE
		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

				AARON
		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

	As she inserts the tape into the player.

	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

	As she watches... this is what she sees...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

				TOM
		That's enough.  That's enough.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Are you okay?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Yes, I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

				TOM
		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

				TOM
		Yeah.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

				TOM
		Really?

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Yes, it is.

				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

				TOM
			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

				JANE
			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

				TOM
		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

				JANE
		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

				TOM
		Why?

				JANE
		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

				TOM
		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

				JANE
			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

				TOM
		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

				JANE
			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

				TOM
			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

				JANE
		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

				TOM
		I got promoted for things like that.

				JANE
		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

				TOM
		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

				JANE
			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

				TOM
		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

				JANE
			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

				TOM
			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

	INT. TERMINAL - DAY

	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

	INT. METAL DETECTOR

	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

				TICKET AGENT
			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

				JANE
		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

				TOM
			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

				JANE
		I don't wan to discuss work.

				TOM
		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

				JANE
		I knew what you meant.

				TOM
		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

				JANE
		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

				TOM
		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

				JANE
		It's okay.

				TICKET AGENT
		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

				JANE
		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

				TOM
			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

				JANE
			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

				TOM
			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

				JANE
			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

				TOM
		Take it easy.

				JANE
		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

				TOM
		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

	ON JANE

	Watching him go.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

	Jane gets quickly into cab.

				CABBIE
		Good morning.

				JANE
		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

				JANE
		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

				JANE
		But New York Avenue's faster.

							FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

	ON TOM

	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

				TOM
		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

				TOM
		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

				LILA
			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

				AARON
		Hi.

				TOM
		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

				BOY
		Clifford...

				AARON
			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

				BOY
		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

				AARON
		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

				TOM
		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

				AARON
		Okay.

				TOM
			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

				LILA
			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

				LILA
		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

				AARON
		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

				TOM
		I appreciate it.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

	ON JANE

	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

				TOM
		A picnic?

				JANE
		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

				AARON
		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

				AARON
		He excels at gratitude.

				TOM
			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

				JANE
		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

				AARON
		Really?

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

				TOM
		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

				JANE
		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

				TOM
		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

				JANE
		I'm sorry because I was looking
		forward to that, but I' m going
		back in a few hours.

				TOM
		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

				TOM
			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

				AARON
		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

				TOM
		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

				AARON
		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

	ON JANE

	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

				TOM
			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

				AARON
			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

				TOM
			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

				AARON
		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

				JANE
		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been 
		getting me into water skiing.

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

				JANE
		I like it!  So, doll, what about you
		lately?

				AARON
		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
	their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

							FADE OUT.
FADE IN

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
	restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
	door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
	state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
	inside as we SUPER:

		KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963

	INT. TRUCK - DAY

	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

				GERALD
		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

				TOM
		No.  Not even you.

				GERALD
		Why so glum?

				TOM
		I don't know.

				GERALD
			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

				TOM
		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

				GERALD
		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

				TOM
		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

				GERALD
		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

				TOM
		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

				GERALD
		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

				TOM
		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

				TOM
		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

				GERALD
		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

				TOM
		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

				TOM
		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

				GERALD
			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

				TOM
			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)
		It better help.  What can you do with
		yourself if all you do is look good?

	BOSTON, MASS. - 1965

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

	AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
	rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

				AARON
		...and finally to the teachers of
		Whitman High School, I don't have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the English Department here than 
		my own limitations...

	He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort.

				AARON
		...that was, of course, not meant to
		be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
		I am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from High School two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it.
		If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
		I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

	ANGLE ON TEACHERS

				MALE TEACHER
		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

	ANGLE ON STAGE

	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

				YOUTH #1
		Later, Aaron.

	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

	CLOSER IN

	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

				AARON
		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

				AARON
		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

				AARON
		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

				YOUTH TOUGH
		Nineteen thousand dollars...
		Not bad.

	ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968

	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

				JANE
			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

	OTHER ANGLE

	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

				JANE
			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

				FATHER
			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

				JANE
		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

				FATHER
		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

				JANE
		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

				FATHER
		You don't have to finish tonight.

				JANE
			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

				FATHER
		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

				JANE
		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

	ON JANE

	As she dials one room number.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Hi...It's me...

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
	essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
	to Jane.

				JANE'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		It's thirty minutes before you have
		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

				AARON
		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		Good Morning America, the
		Morning News and Today are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

				JANE
		A half hour in the lobby.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	INT. BUS STATION - DAY

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

				AARON
		Ready.
 
				CAMERAMAN
		Your hair's a little funny.

				AARON
		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

				CAMERAMAN
		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

				AARON
		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

				CAMERAMAN
		Okay.

	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

				AARON
		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

				AARON
		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

				CAMERAMAN
		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

				AARON
		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

	INT. GATE AREA - DAY

	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

				J.D.
		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

				AARON
		Just a few questions?

				J.D.
		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

				AARON
		We came from Washington.

				J.D.
		Move away from me.

				AARON
			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

				J.D.
			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

				AARON
		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

				JANE
		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

				AARON
		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

				JANE
		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

				AARON
			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

				J.D.
			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

				JANE
		I love that turn away.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

				JANE
			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

				WOMAN
			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
	A WOMAN in blackness.

				WOMAN THREE
			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

				JANE
		Please don't applaud.

	ON AUDIENCE

	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

				JANE
		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's WRONG with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

				JANE
		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

				JANE
		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

	TRACKING SHOT

	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

				JANE
		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

	SHOT CONTINUES

	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

	ON JANE

	Briefly departing from text.

				JANE
		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

				TOM
		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

	BACK TO JANE

	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

				JANE
		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

	ON MONITORS

	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

	ON SCENE

	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

				JANE
			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

	OTHER ANGLE

	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

				TOM
		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

	ANGLE ON TOM

	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

				JANE
		Hi.

				TOM
		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

				JANE
			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

				TOM
		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

				JANE
		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

				JANE
		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

				TOM
		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

				TOM
		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

				JANE
			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

				TOM
		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

				TOM
		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

				JANE
		If we could just eat first.

				TOM
		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

				JANE
		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

				JANE
		Thank you.

	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

				JANE
		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

				TOM
		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

				TOM
		That actually goes on...

				JANE
		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

				TOM
		Yes, sure.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

				TOM
		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

				TOM
		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

				JANE
			(levelly)
		I trust you.

				TOM
		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

				TOM
		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

				TOM
		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

				JANE
		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

				TOM
		One year...almost one year.

				JANE
		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

				TOM
		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

				JANE
		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

				TOM
		Uh-huh.

				JANE
			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

				TOM
		Whoa, this was a mistake.

				JANE
		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

				JANE
		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

				TOM
		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She is on the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As he talks with Jane.

				AARON
			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

				JANE
		Why do you say that?

				AARON
		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

				AARON
		Okay.  Let's do me.

				JANE
		Sure.

				AARON
		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

				JANE
		This conversation is not worthy of you.

				AARON
		I'd give anything if that were true.

				JANE
			(laughing)
		Good night.

				AARON
		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

				JANE
		Call if you get weird.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

				JANE
			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH

	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

				TOM
		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

				JANE
			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

	INTERCUT:

	ON TOM

				TOM
		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

				JANE
		What???

	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

				AARON
		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the Times and he had a great
		audition tape.

				JANE
		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Tom arrives for first day of work.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

				JANE
			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

				BOBBIE
		We could...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

				TOM
		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

				TOM
		They said it would be okay if...

				JANE
			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

				JANE
		Play back the last line...

				BOBBIE
		He said something about...

				JANE
			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

				BLAIR
		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

	TOM

	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

				MERCENARY
			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

				JANE
		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

				BLAIR
		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

				BLAIR
		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

				JANE
		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

				BOBBIE
		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				AARON
		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

				AARON
		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

				KLEIN
		Sure.

				JENNIFER
		Why not?

				ERNIE
		Absolutely.

				GEORGE
		You bet.

				AARON
		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

				BLAIR
		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

				ERNIE
		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

				BLAIR
		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

				AARON
		What is she shooting?

				BLAIR
		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

				AARON
			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

				JANE
		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

				BOBBIE
		Should I...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

				BLAIR
			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

				AARON
		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a Homecoming  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

				BLAIR
		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

				BLAIR
		In 84 seconds?

	ON CLOCK

	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

				JANE
			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

				AARON
		Eleven and a half.

				JANE
		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

				BLAIR
		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

	ON CLOCK

	42 seconds away.

				BLAIR
		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

				BOBBIE
		Whoops.

				BLAIR
			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

				AARON
		Shit, shit, shit...

				TOM
			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

				BOBBIE
		Ready.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

				BLAIR
		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

				AARON
		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

	ON MONITOR

	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

				BILL
			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

				JENNIFER
		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
		liked it.

				AARON
		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

				BLAIR
		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

				BLAIR
		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

				ERNIE
		I saw the smile -- good piece.

				AARON
		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

				TOM
		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

				JANE
			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

				TOM
		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

				JANE
		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

				TOM
		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

				JANE
		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

				TOM
		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

				JANE
		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

				TOM
		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

				JANE
		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

				AARON
		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

				JANE
		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

				AARON
		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

				JANE
		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

	ANGLE ON

	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

				CAMERAMAN
		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

				JANE
		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

				TOM
		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

				CONCIERGE
		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

				AARON
		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

				AARON
		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

				JANE
		Let's tape.

				CAMERAMAN
			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

				JANE
		That's okay.

	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

				AARON
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

				AARON
		Did you shoot their boots?

				JANE
		Of course.

				AARON
		We can cut back at the end.

				JANE
		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

				AARON
		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

				REPORTER
		I think he's coming out now.

				TOM
			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

				TOM
			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

	ON TOM

	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

				CAMERAMAN
			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

				TOM
		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

				CAMERAMAN
		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

				JANE
		Are you all packed and ready?

				CAMERAMAN
		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

				JANE
		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

	ON TELEVISION MONITORS

	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

				BLAIR
		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

				ERNIE
		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

	ON JANE

	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

				TOM
		Hi.

				JANE
		How's it going?

				TOM
		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

				JANE
			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

				TOM
		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

				BLAIR
		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

	ON MONITOR

	We see Bill Rorish.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Jane?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		But thanks.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

				JANE
		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

				JANE
			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

				TOM
			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

				AARON
		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

				AARON
		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

				BLAIR
		What did he say?

				JANE
			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

				BUDDY
		Could I see how I photograph?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Huh?  Sorry?

				BUDDY
		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

				AARON
		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		That's your full name?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

				BUDDY
		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

				AARON
		Eventually rising to...

				BUDDY
		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

				AARON
		Eventually rising to?

				BUDDY

		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

				BUDDY
		I don't like the word gay.

				AARON
		Which would you prefer?

				BUDDY
		Ravenous homosexual.

				AARON
		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

				BUDDY
			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

				BUDDY
		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

				TOM
		No, I don't think so.

				BUDDY
		How do I get out of here?

				TOM
		Follow me.

				BUDDY
			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

				GUARD
		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

				BUDDY
		I'm leaving.

				TOM
			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

				BUDDY
		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

				TOM
		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

				BUDDY
		Is there a regular bar around here?

	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

				TOM
		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

				BUDDY
		Bad manners.

				TOM
		Yes.  That's right.

				BUDDY
		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

				TOM
		No...no.

				BUDDY
		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

				TOM
		I really have to go.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

				TOM
		What?

				BUDDY
		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

				TOM
		Yes.  How do you know?

				BUDDY
			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

				GEORGE
		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

				ERNIE
			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

				TOM
		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

				GEORGE
			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

				TOM
		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

				ERNIE
		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

				BOBBIE
		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

				JANE
		No stop where he's all besieged.

				BOBBIE
		Because...

				JANE
			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

				TOM
		So he was indicted?

				JANE
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		We were right not to go with it.

				TOM
		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

				JANE
			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

				TOM
		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

				BOBBIE
			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

				JANE
		Bobbie, please.

	INT. METRO BUS - DAY

	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

				BUDDY
		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

				TOM
		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

				BUDDY
			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

				TOM
		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

				BUDDY
		I see the change in you -- I see it.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
	network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
	steers her outside.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

				JENNIFER
		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

				TOM
		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

				JENNIFER
		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

				TOM
		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

				JENNIFER
		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a
		great tour.

	INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
	her story.

				JENNIFER
			(voice over; on TV set)
		The President says it's not a violation
		but nonetheless White House sources
		say the full price will be paid for the
		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

				BUDDY
		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

				TOM
		Nobody else had it.

				BUDDY
		I wish it were you giving the story.

				TOM
		That's okay.

				BUDDY
		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

				TOM
		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

				TOM
		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
	RAPTURE.

				BUDDY
		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

				TOM
		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

				BUDDY
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

				JANE
		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

				TOM
		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

				TOM
		I've got another story.

				JANE
		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

				TOM
		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

				JANE
		Billion.

				TOM
		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		You write this?

				JANE
		I write for you sometimes.

				AARON
		Not because you have to.

	ON MONITOR

	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

				GENERAL
		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

				TOM
		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

	ON TOM

	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

				BLAIR
		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

				AARON
		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

				JANE
		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

				BLAIR
		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

				ERNIE
		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

				TOM
		Hi, Ellie.

				ERNIE
		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

				AARON
			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

				ELLIE
		I'm sorry -- from where?

				AARON
		I've been to your house a lot...

				ERNIE
			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

				ELLIE
			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

	Tom is on the phone.

				TOM
			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

				BLAIR
		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

				BLAIR
		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

				GREY HAIRED MAN
			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

				BLAIR
		Goodbye, Paul.

				AARON
		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

				BLAIR
		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

				AARON
		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

				BLAIR
		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

				AARON
		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

	ON JANE

	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

				JENNIFER
		This is very awkward.

				JANE
		Go ahead -- what?

				JENNIFER
		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

				JANE
		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

				JENNIFER
		You're saying stay away from him.

				JANE
			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

				JENNIFER
		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

				GEORGE WELN
		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

				ERNIE'S WIFE
			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

				JANE
			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

				TOM
		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

				JANE
		What do you mean clean?

				TOM
		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

				JANE
		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

				TOM
		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

				JANE
		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

	ON AARON AND ERNIE

				ERNIE
		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

				AARON
		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

				ERNIE
		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

				ANNE
		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

				ANNE
		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

	ON JANE

	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

				JANE
		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

	ON STAIRCASE

	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

				JANE
		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

				JENNIFER
		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

				JENNIFER
		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

	FULL SCENE

	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

				ERNIE
		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

				ERNIE
			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

				JANE
		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

				ERNIE
		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

				JANE
		Let's figure out the field.

				ERNIE
		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

				AARON
		That's it.  I resign as of now.

				ERNIE
			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

				AARON
		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

				JANE
		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

				ERNIE
		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

	ON JANE

	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

				TOM
		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

				JANE
		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

				PAUL
		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

				JANE
		It's not opinion.

				PAUL
		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

				PAUL
		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

				JANE
			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

				JANE
			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

				AARON
		What happened?

				JANE
		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

				AARON
		Watch? --

				JANE
		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

				AARON
		Yeah, love you, too.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

	As it moves off.

				JANE
		Nervous?

				TOM
		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

				JANE
		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

				BLAIR
		And Bobbie says...

				JANE
		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

				BLAIR
			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

				JANE
		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

				JANE
		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

				JANE
		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

				GRAPHIC ARTIST
		We have no pictures on file.

				JANE
		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

				GUARD
		I have to check first.

				BUDDY
			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

				BUDDY
		Is everything all right?

				TOM
		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

				BUDDY
			(delighted)
		Anchor?

				TOM
			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

				BUDDY
		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

				TOM
		Oh.

				BUDDY
		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

				TOM
		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

				BUDDY
		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

				TOM
		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

				BUDDY
			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

				TOM
		I'll speak to you.

				BUDDY
		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

				BLAIR
			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

				JANE
		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

				TOM
			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

				TOM
		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

				MAN ONE
		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

				PAUL
		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

				TOM
		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

				AARON
			(SINGING LOUDLY)
		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

	ON TV

	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

	INT. BOOTH

	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

				JANE
		George, you're ready.

	ON PENTAGON MONITOR

	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

				GEORGE
			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

				JANE
		Cover everything!

	George nods.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

	ON TOM

				TOM
		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

				AARON
		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	As Blair hands it to Jane.

				BLAIR
		It's Aaron.

				JANE
		Yes?

				AARON
		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

				JANE
		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

				TOM
		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

				GEORGE
		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

				AARON
		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

				AARON
			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

	ON JANE

				JANE
		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

				AARON
			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

				AARON
		Nice, Jane.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

	ON TOM

	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

	BACK TO JANE

	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

				JANE
		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

				PAUL
			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

				TOM
			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

				TOM
		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

				TOM'S VOICE
		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

				PAUL
		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

				ERNIE
			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

				JANE
		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

				JANE
		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

				PAUL
			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

				PAUL
			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

				TOM
		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

				ERNIE
			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

				MARVIN
		We're here to play the new news theme.

				ERNIE
		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

				PAUL
		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

				MAN ONE
		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

				PAUL
		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

				ERNIE
		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

				TOM
		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

				JANE
			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

				TOM
		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

				TOM
		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

				JANE
		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

				TOM
		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

				JANE
			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

				TOM
		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

				TOM
		Jane?

				JANE
		Yeah?

				TOM
		I'll wait for you till seven.

				JANE
			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

	ON AARON

	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

				JANE
		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

				JANE
		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

				AARON
		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

				AARON
		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

				JANE
		Well, whatever you think.

				AARON
		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

				JANE
		Sounds like you may be on to something.

				AARON
		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

				JANE
		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

				AARON
		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

				JANE
		Yes.

				AARON
		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

				AARON
		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	ON JANE

	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

	INT. CAB - EVENING

				JANE
		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

				JANE
		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

				DRIVER
		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

				JANE
		Thanks -- good driving --

				DRIVER
		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

				JANE
		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

				TOM
		I didn't think you'd make it.

				JANE
		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

				TOM
		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

				JANE
		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

				JANE
		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

				JENNIFER
			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

				JANE
			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

				TOM
		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

				JENNIFER
			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

				JENNIFER
		Sorry.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

				TOM
		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

				JENNIFER
		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

				TOM
			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

				JENNIFER
		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

				JENNIFER
		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

				TOM
		Where's the bathroom?

				JENNIFER
		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

				JENNIFER
		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

				TOM
		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

				JENNIFER
		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

				TOM
		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

				AARON
		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

				JANE
		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

				JANE
		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

				AARON
		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

				BLAIR
		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

				JANE
			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

				PAUL
		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

				JANE
			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

				JANE
		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

				TOM
		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

				JANE
			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

				JANE
		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

				TOM
		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

				JANE
		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
		Is it safe for me to fly home?

				TOM
		Yes.  We're fine now.

				JANE
		AND SMILE.

	He smiles -- people smile back.

				JANE
		AND MOVE.

	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

				AARON
		Who the heck could that be?

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

	ON AARON

	And now he sees that it's Tom.

				AARON
		Is God testing me or something?

				MARTIN KLEIN
		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

				AARON
		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

				TOM
		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

				AARON
		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

				TOM
		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

				AARON
		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

				TOM
		What did I do to you?

				AARON
		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

				TOM
			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

				AARON
			(several beats; then)
		How you doing?

				TOM
			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

				AARON
		Keep it to yourself.

				TOM
		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

				AARON
		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

				AARON
		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

				TOM
		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

				AARON
			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

				TOM
		Shut up a second...

				AARON
			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

				TOM
			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

				AARON
		And the rule was...

				TOM
		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

				AARON
		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

				TOM
			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

				AARON
		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

				AARON
			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

				TOM
		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

				AARON
		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

				TOM
		Yes.

				AARON
		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

				TOM
		You're feeling good, aren't you?

				AARON
			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

				TOM
			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

	LONG SHOT

	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

				TOM
		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

				JANE
		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

				TOM
		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

				TOM
		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

				JANE
		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

				TOM
			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

				JANE
		What?

				TOM
		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

				JANE
		Well, what is it?

				TOM
		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

				TOM
		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

				TOM
		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

	ON TOM

	His spirits lifted.

	ON JANE

	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

				JANE
		Hello.

				TO
			(uncertain)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Hello...Who is it?

	INTERCUT:

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

				JANE
		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

				TOM
		Yes.

				JANE
		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

				TOM
		It's not important.

				JANE
		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

				TOM
		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

				JANE
		Nooo.  Is it your story?

				TOM
		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

				JANE
		Why, you need me for the story?

				TOM
		No.  Were you going to you?

				JANE
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

				JANE
		Oh, good.

				TOM
		We can go together.


				JANE
		So you like me, huh?

				TOM
		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

				TOM
			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

				BOBBIE
		Yes, and thanks for asking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

	ON MONITOR

				UNIFORMED COP
		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

				YOUNG WOMAN
		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

	ON NEWSROOM

	As Aaron enters the scene.

				AARON
		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

	ON MONITOR

				YOUNG WOMAN
		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

	ON MONITOR

	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

	ON NEWSROOM

	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

				AARON
		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

				TOM
			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

	NEWSROOM

	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

				AARON
		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

				TOM
		What's wrong with it?

				AARON
		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

	MONITOR

	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

	ON JANE

	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

	ON TOM AND JANE

	Now off a bit by themselves.

				TOM
		So what did you think?

				JANE
		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

				TOM
			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				JENNIFER
		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

				BLAIR
		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

				ERNIE
		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

				AARON
			(puzzled)
		Outside?

				ERNIE
		Yeah --

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

				ERNIE
		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

				AARON
		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

				ERNIE
			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

				AARON
		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

				ERNIE
		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

				AARON
		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

				ERNIE
		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

				ERNIE
		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

				AARON
		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

				ERNIE
		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

				AARON
			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

				ERNIE
		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

				AARON
			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

				ERNIE
		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

				AARON
		Do it then.

				ERNIE
		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

				AARON
		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

				ERNIE
		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

				AARON
		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

				ERNIE
		I understand.  I'll go with you.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

				AARON
		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

				TOM
		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

				AARON
		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

				TOM
		Wait.

				AARON
		What?

				TOM
		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

				TOM
		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

				AARON
			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

				TOM
		Sit on it!  Now look.

				AARON
		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

				TOM
		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

				AARON
		It's not loaded.

				TOM
		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

				TOM
		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

				AARON
		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

				AARON
		I'm very appreciative.

	SAME SCENE - LATER

	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

				TOM
		No.  No.

				AARON
		No?

				TOM
		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

				AARON
		Oh, God, no!

				TOM
		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

				TOM
		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

				AARON
		Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

				TOM
		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

				TOM
		You were smokin' toward the end there.

				AARON
		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

				TOM
		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

				AARON
		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

				AARON
		I didn't know you were going with him.

				JANE
		Did you bring your grey suit?

				AARON
		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

				JANE
			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

				JANE
		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

				AARON
		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

				JANE
			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

				JANE
			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

				JANE
		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

				AARON
		Really?

	Jane nods.

				AARON
		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

				JANE
		As good as humanly possible.

				AARON
		Yes.

				JANE
		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

				AARON
		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

				JANE
		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

				AARON
		If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

				JANE
		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

				AARON
		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

				JANE
		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

				AARON
		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

	INT. CAB - NIGHT

	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

				MAN ONE
		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

				MAN THREE
		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

				WOMAN
		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

				MAN
		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

	ON JANE

	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

	ON TOM

	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

	ON JANE

	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

	ON TOM

	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

				TOM
			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

				JANE
		Who?

				TOM
		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

				AARON
		Want to look at this?

				W.N.P.
		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

				GEORGE
			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

				AARON
			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

				GEORGE
		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

				W.N.P.
		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

				AARON
		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

				W.N.P.
		Sure.  You'll be fine.

				AARON
			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

				TOM
		How you doing, Paul?

				PAUL
		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

				TOM
		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

				PAUL
		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

				JANE
		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

				TOM
		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

				JANE
		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

				TOM
		Jane.

	She turns.

				TOM
		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

				JANE
		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

	ON TOM

	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

	FULL SHOT

	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten.

				AARON
		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

				AARON
			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Gee whiz.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

				AARON
		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

				AARON
		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

				AARON
		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

				AARON
		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Someone finds me some big towels.

	ON AARON

	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	ON MAKEUP WOMAN

	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

				DIRECTOR
		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

				TECHNICIAN
			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is more than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Can't you just die for him?

	ON MONITOR

	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Great.

	FULL SHOT

	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

				TOM
			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

				JANE
		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

				JANE
		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

				TOM
			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

				JANE
		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

				JANE
		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

				TOM
		Because you're nuts.

				JANE
		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

				TOM
		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

				JANE
		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

				TOM
		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

				JANE
			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

				TOM
		What?

				JANE
		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

				TOM
		That's not it.

				JANE
		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

				JANE
		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

				JANE
			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

				JANE
		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

				TOM
		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

				JANE
		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

				TOM
		JANE!

	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

				JANE
		What happened?

				TOM
		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

				JANE
		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

				TOM
		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

				JANE
		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

				AARON
		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				JANE
		How'd it go?

				AARON
		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

				JANE
		No.

				AARON
		Then it went well.

				JANE
		Did it really go well?

				AARON
		Define your terms.

				JANE
		Do you feel good about it?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Do others feel that you did well?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Then what was good about it?

				AARON
		I lost six pounds...

				JANE
		Aaron, will you tell me?

				AARON
		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

				JANE
		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

				AARON
		People phoned in.

				JANE
		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

				AARON
		I'm not kidding.

				JANE
		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

				AARON
		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

				JANE
		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

				AARON
		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

				JANE
		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

				JANE
		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

				AARON
		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

				JANE
			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

				AARON
			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

				AARON
		Don't go.

				JANE
		This is important to me.

				AARON
		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

				JANE
		What?

				AARON
			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

				AARON
		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

				JANE
			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

				AARON
		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

				JANE
		Yeah -- being a basket case.

				AARON
		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

				JANE
			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

				AARON
		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

				JANE
		I think you're the Devil.

				AARON
		No.  You know that I'm not.

				JANE
		How?

				AARON
		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

				JANE
		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

				AARON
		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

				AARON
			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

				JANE
			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

				AARON
		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	A woman walking from a car.

	ON TOM

	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

	INTERCUT:

	BACK TO SCENE

	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

				JANE
		Hi.  It's me.

				TOM
		Where are you?

				JANE
		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

				TOM
		Well, when?

				JANE
		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

				TOM
		I know.  I taped it.

				JANE
		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

				TOM
		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

				JANE
		Don't say anything about anything.

				AARON
		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

				TOM
		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

				AARON
		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

				TOM
		No.  Don't worry about it.

				AARON
		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

				JANE
		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

				TOM
		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

				JANE
		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

				TOM
		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

				JANE
			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

				TOM
			(finally)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Yes.

				TOM
		Okay.  Good night.

				JANE
			(aghast)
		Good night??!

				TOM
		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

				JANE
		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

				JANE
		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

				JANE
		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

				AARON
		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

				ERNIE
			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

				ERNIE
		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

				WIFE
		What?

				ERNIE
		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

				WIFE
			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

				BLAIR
		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

				BLAIR
		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

				JANE
		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

				BLAIR
		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The door now closed.

	JANE

	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

				TOM
		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

				JANE
			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

				TOM
		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

	TOM AND HIS DAD

				DAD
		You want my opinion?

				TOM
		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

				DAD
		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

				TOM
		Yes, I would.

				DAD
		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

				BILL
		Just when do you start, telling people?

				PAUL
		Almost immediately.

				BILL
		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

				PAUL
		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

				BILL
		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

				BLAIR
		Welcome back to Washington.

				BILL
		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

				BILL
		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

				BILL
		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

				PAUL
			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

				PAUL
		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

				BILL
		Hi.  It's about time.

				TOM
		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

	INSERT

	A great handshake.

	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

				TOM
		This is my father.

				BILL
		Good to meet you, sir.

	ON TOM

	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

				MR. GRUNICK
		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

				MR. GRUNICK
		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters...

				JANE
		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

				TOM
		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

				JANE
			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

				TOM
		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

				JANE
			(so softly)
		What?

				TOM
			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

				JANE
		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

				BLAIR
		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

				JANE
		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

				BOBBIE
		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

	INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

				SECRETARY
		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

				PAUL
		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

				PAUL
		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

				ANONYMOUS VOICE
		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

				TOM
		Have you guys seen Jane?

				ERNIE
		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

				AARON
		What did they do with you?

				TOM
		They booted me out of Washington.

				AARON
		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

				TOM
		Why?  What did they do to you?

				ERNIE
			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of
		him.

				AARON
		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

				ERNIE
		The cost-efficient reporter.

				AARON
		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

				TOM
		You packing up tonight?

				AARON
		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

				TOM
		London.

				AARON
			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

				TOM
			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

				AARON
		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

				TOM
		Hold it down, okay?

				AARON
		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

				TOM
		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

				AARON
		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

				AARON
		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

				TOM
			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

				TOM
		You know what I...

				AARON
		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

				OLDER SECRETARY
		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

				JANE
		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

				JANE
		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

				BLAIR
		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

				JANE
		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

				TOM
		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

				JANE
		How can you say that to me?

				TOM
		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

				JANE
		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

				TOM
		That's yes?

				JANE
		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings.  He answers.

				AARON
		Hello.

	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

				JANE
		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

				AARON
		Speaking.

				JANE
		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

				JANE
		Why not try it for a few weeks?

				AARON
		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

				JANE
		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

				AARON
		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

				JANE
		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

				AARON
		Let's go...

				JANE
		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

				AARON
		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

				JANE
		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

				AARON
		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

				JANE
			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

				AARON
		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

				JANE
		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

				AARON
		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

	As she inserts the tape into the player.

	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

	As she watches... this is what she sees...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		...but the whole thing messed me

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

				TOM
		That's enough.  That's enough.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Are you okay?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Yes, I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

				TOM
		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		Tom

				TOM
		Yeah.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

				TOM
		Really?

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Yes, it is.

				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

				TOM
			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

				JANE
			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

				TOM
		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

				JANE
		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

				TOM
		Why?

				JANE
		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

				TOM
		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

				JANE
			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

				TOM
		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

				JANE
			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

				TOM
			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

				JANE
		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

				TOM
		I got promoted for things like that.

				JANE
		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

				TOM
		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

				JANE
			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

				TOM
		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

				JANE
			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

				TOM
			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

	INT. TERMINAL - DAY

	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

	INT. METAL DETECTOR

	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

				TICKET AGENT
			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

				JANE
		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

				TOM
			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

				JANE
		I don't wan to discuss work.

				TOM
		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

				JANE
		I knew what you meant.

				TOM
		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

				JANE
		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

				TOM
		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

				JANE
		It's okay.

				TICKET AGENT
		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

				JANE
		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

				TOM
			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

				JANE
			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

				TOM
			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

				JANE
			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

				TOM
		Take it easy.

				JANE
		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

				TOM
		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

	ON JANE

	Watching him go.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

	Jane gets quickly into cab.

				CABBIE
		Good morning.

				JANE
		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

				JANE
		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

				JANE
		But New York Avenue's faster.

							FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

	ON TOM

	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

				TOM
		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

				TOM
		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

				LILA
			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

				AARON
		Hi.

				TOM
		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

				BOY
		Clifford...

				AARON
			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

				BOY
		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

				AARON
		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

				TOM
		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

				AARON
		Okay.

				TOM
			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

				LILA
			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

				LILA
		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

				AARON
		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

				TOM
		I appreciate it.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

	ON JANE

	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

				TOM
		A picnic?

				JANE
		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

				AARON
		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

				AARON
		He excels at gratitude.

				TOM
			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

				JANE
		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

				AARON
		Really?

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

				TOM
		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

				JANE
		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

				TOM
		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

				JANE
		I'm sorry because I was looking
		forward to that, but I' m going
		back in a few hours.

				TOM
		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

				TOM
			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

				AARON
		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

				TOM
		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

				AARON
		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

	ON JANE

	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

				TOM
			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

				AARON
			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

				TOM
			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

				AARON
		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

				JANE
		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been 
		getting me into water skiing.

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

				JANE
		I like it!  So, doll, what about you
		lately?

				AARON
		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
	their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

							FADE OUT.

1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1

    Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

                        NARRATOR
              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.


2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2

    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

                        NARRATOR
              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)


3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

                        NARRATOR
              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              Thirty eight, all told.


4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4

    CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
    "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".



                                                               2

4   CONTINUED:                                                  4


                           NARRATOR
                 Mischief moved them on in life, and
                 moving kept them close.


5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

                           NARRATOR
                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6

    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

                           NARRATOR
                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

                           STEPHEN
                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

                           NARRATOR
                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

                           STEPHEN
                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.


7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

                           NARRATOR
                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

                                                                 3
  




8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 Their pocket-change bought rocket
                 pops,


9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9

     The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
     while Stephen counts out pennies.

                           NARRATOR
                 The brothers,

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

                           STEPHEN
                 Pixie Stix.


10   EXT. PARK                                                   10

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                           NARRATOR (cont'd)
                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

                           STEPHEN
                 The playground bourgeoisies.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

                                                                  4
   




11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12

     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

                         NARRATOR
               Could he simply

                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
               Talk to her!

                         NARRATOR
               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.


13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

                         BLOOM
               What's doing?

                            STEPHEN
               What?



                                                                   5

                  You shuffle when you're thinking
                  something through. So whatcha
                  thinking?

                            STEPHEN
                  Not a thing.

                            NARRATOR
                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.


14   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                14

                            STEPHEN
                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

                            NARRATOR
                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

                            STEPHEN
                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"


15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

                            NARRATOR
                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.


   

                                                                  6

                            BLOOM
                  Hi.

     They talk.    They run.   They laugh.   They play.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Bloom performed his role in
                  Stephen's story to a T.

     BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"


16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

                            NARRATOR
                  And being who he wasn't, could be
                  as he wished to be.

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

     out a cave deep in the woods.

     several large coolers are purchased.

     Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
     homeward in the warm twilight.

     BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
     eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
     look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.


22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22

     Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
     glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:

     Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
     coolers"

     Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.

                         STEPHEN
               Oh - kay. How's it going on the
               playground front?

                         BLOOM
               It's great.

                         STEPHEN
               So, on to step eleven, then.   The
               Tale. You tell them -

                            BLOOM
               Wait...

     Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.

                         NARRATOR
               Must the numbers rattle on?    Must
               the fiction end?

                         BLOOM
               I think I need more time to win
               their-

                          STEPHEN
               Bloom. They're not your friends.
               They're part of this, and this aint
               real. Remember, it's a con.
               And when it's done, we've just got
               us. And we'll be moving on.
                   (beat)
               So, the tale. You tell them
               there's a

     Bloom holds court with the kids.

                            BLOOM
                  hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
                  steel toothed vagabond...


24   INT. ATTIC                                                24

     Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic

                            BLOOM
                  ...with blood red eyes?

                             STEPHEN
                      (nods)
                  That's good. He stopped you coming
                  home from school...


25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25

                            BLOOM
                  ...and told me of a cave.

                            GIRL
                  What kind of cave?

                            BLOOM
                  A cave of wonders.

                              BOY
                  Pffft ha.

                            GIRL
                  Shut up, Dave.

                            BLOOM
                  At noon on every Sunday, there
                  appears a ball of light, which
                  flutters like a butterfly...

                            GIRL
                  A will-o-whisp?

                            BLOOM
                  That's right. It guides you

                                                               9

                  ...to where the treasures lay.

                            BOY
                  So where's this cave?

                            GIRL
                  Yeah, where?


28   INT. ATTIC                                                28

                            STEPHEN
                  Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
                  He got this greedy glinting look,
                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.


29   EXT. PARK                                                 29

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
     silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.

                            EXCITED BOY
                  Well that's just two bucks each!

     The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
     Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
     girl's joyful gaze.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Sunday came...


30   EXT. WOODS                                                30

     Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
     woods, led by Bloom.





                                                                10

                            NARRATOR
                  ...and straight from church, into
                  the woods Bloom led.


31   INT. CAVE                                                    31

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
     water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
     floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
     children come into sight.

                            NARRATOR
                  They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
                  There it was.


32   EXT. CAVE                                                    32

     The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.

                            GIRL
                  Just like the hermit said!

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.


33   INT. CAVE                                                    33

     The light glows just around the next corner... the children
     run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
     corner...

     And the light glows just around the next corner. They
     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
     but they're all having the time of their lives.

     Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
     of wonder.






                                                                11

                            NARRATOR
                  For just one moment, Bloom forgot
                  himself and ran too fast.

     He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  He'd catch the light and find the
                  treasure...

     Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
     Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
     next corner.

     Bloom stops running.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  But the moment passed.

     The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
     still, a strange expression on his face.

     The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
     her hand for him to follow.

     But he doesn't.    He stays behind, and is soon left alone.


34   EXT. PLAYGROUND                                               34

                            NARRATOR
                  They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
                  but didn't really care.

     The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
     against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
     their money.

                            STEPHEN
                  It seems to me that in the end, the
                  perfect con is where
                  each one involved gets just the
                  thing they wanted.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah I guess so.

                             NARRATOR
                  Our fledgling thieves were
                  satisfied.

                                                                12
  




35   EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY                                      35

     A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
     parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.

                          NARRATOR
                The children's parents, less so.

     The Foster Parents exchange a glance.

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Stephen is smacked.

     The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
     angry big one.

     A telephone slams down.

     On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
     "Larceny."


36   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                           36

     Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
     The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
     sunlight.

                          NARRATOR
                A bitter ending? Maybe. But
                there's sweetness in the mix.

     Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
     flow-chart. Numbered boxes.

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                The brothers Bloom had found their
                calling.

     One of the boxes... number six...

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                As shown in number six.

     BOX #6:   "Cut % O'Henry's"

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'
                percentage deal.

                                                              13





37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37

     Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
     Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.

                         NARRATOR
               `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
               clean shop.

     And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
     Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
     Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
     little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.


38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38

     Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
     Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
     him.

                         STEPHEN
               So how's it feel?

     Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
     the distance.

                         NARRATOR
               In truth, young Bloom won't know
               for twenty years just how he felt.

     HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
     brothers pick themselves up.

     Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

                         STEPHEN
               Let `em melt.

     The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
     strides down the alleyway.

     Stephen in front.

     Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
     the children playing in the sun.

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40

     Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.

     TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER

     A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
     the flaming books.

                            YOUNG MAN
                  He gets the scarab, you get the
                  money, I get the girl... so in the
                  end, everyone gets everything he
                  wants.

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
                  are you... oh god he's dead,
                  Victor's dead... you've killed us!
                  We had it he was right it was all
                  in the bag and now we're dead, why?
                  Why, you stupid son of a bitch?

     The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
     in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
     hard.






                                                               15

                             CHARLESTON
                  Cause the Turk was right. After
                  seeing her, after that night on the
                  airstrip, after Cairo everything
                  changed, and he couldn't see the
                  play through that one milky eye,
                  but the Turk was right about one
                  thing, that there's nothing
                  beautiful about money. She's
                  beautiful.

                            MCGUIRE
                  This isn't happening...

                            CHARLESTON
                  He'll never have her now. She's
                  free. And I'll never see her in
                  scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
                  but it's worth the money and my job
                  and his life and the rest of my
                  life that she's free.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Charleston. I can't be here...

                            CHARLESTON
                  You're not here. Neither of us
                  are. It's Mowcher's gun.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Mowcher is at the bottom of the
                  Spree with a cowl in his neck!

     Charleston gets to his feet.

                            CHARLESTON
                  They won't find him for a week, and
                  the Albino will chalk it up to
                  Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Listen to you - four months ago you
                  were an investment banker! Now
                  you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
                  The money's gone. It'll rot in the
                  Peruvian earth. It's gone.

     Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.






                                                              16

40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40


                         CHARLESTON
               The man named Charleston you met
               nine months and a thousand years
               ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
               dead. If we see each other again
               it'll be as strangers. As for the
               money... let it rot.

     He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
     Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
     squealing.

     Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
     early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.

                         MCGUIRE
               Wow.

     He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
     to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.

                         MCGUIRE (cont'd)
               Wow is the word you're both looking
               for. Wow.

     The Asian woman nods slightly.

                         VICTOR
                   (un-wowishly)
               You're a genius, Stephen.

     For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
               We're a genius, Bloom.

     Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.   He spits.

                         BLOOM
               Tastes like tin foil.

                         STEPHEN
               So does real blood. Buy you a
               drink.

     Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his
     lip.

                                                              17





41   EXT. HOUSE - PRE-DAWN                                       41

     A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
     holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
     flaming house.

                         STEPHEN
               "Four months and a thousand years
               ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
               He stole that from Kipling.

                           BLOOM
               No.


42   EXT. BERLIN - PRE-DAWN                                      42

     Hazy light over the sprawling city.


43   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                            43

     A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
     expectant in a surprise-party type way.

     A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
     raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.

                         THE TURK
               Make way, make room for the
               brothers Bloom!

     The bar bursts into cheers.


44   INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER                                    44

     A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
     Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.

                         THE TURK
               Nine months, six countries, three
               faked deaths, for one mark. You're
               a beautiful antique, my friend.

     They clink glasses.

                           ALL
               Proust.





                                                                    18

                            THE TURK
                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

                            STEPHEN
                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

                               THE TURK
                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

                            STEPHEN
                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

                            THE TURK
                  It's true you never work with the
                  same crew twice?

                            STEPHEN
                  That's true.

                               THE TURK
                  Well shit.     Except for the uh, for
                  her?

                            STEPHEN
                  La Chinoise?

                               THE TURK
                  Yeah.

     Back at the bar - the Asian woman.       The CHINK.   Being hit on
     by a weasly ROMANIAN.

                            ROMANIAN
                  Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.

  

                                                               19

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

                         STEPHEN
               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
               ins and the outs, and so far as I
               can tell, speaks three words of
               English.

     She taps on the bar.

                            THE CHINK
               Jameson.

                            BARTENDER
               Ice?

     She says `no' with a look.

                         THE ALBINO
               So she's with you and Bloom till
               the end.

                         STEPHEN
               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

                         THE TURK
               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

                         ROSE
               There you are. Hiding?

                            BLOOM
               Yeah.

                         ROSE
               I've been learning.      Stephen likes
               to talk about you.

                         BLOOM
               Did he tell you the cave story?



                                                              20

44   CONTINUED: (3)                                            44


                         ROSE
               Is it true?

                         BLOOM
               What else did he tell you?

                         ROSE
               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

                         BLOOM
               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

                         ROSE
               Why did he do that?

                         BLOOM
               And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves. Sounds
               romantic.

                          ROSE
               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

                         BLOOM
               You want to know how Stephen did
               it? With Charleston?

                         ROSE
               It's not the first thing on my
               mind.

                                                              21





45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

                         BLOOM (O.S.)
               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

                         WIFE
               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

     Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

                         BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
               So in the end, everyone gets
               everything he wants.

     BANG.


46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46

                         BLOOM
               That's what he does, he writes his
               cons the way dead Russians write
               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And
               he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
               hero. And that's why you think you
               want to kiss me. It's a con.

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.




                                                                   22

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I need air.

                            STEPHEN
                  Who doesn't?
                      (plays a card)
                  That's the big 2.


47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

                            STEPHEN
                  We missed the sunrise.    That
                  would've been nice.

     They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.


48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

                            STEPHEN
                      (to camels)
                  Back to the swamps!

     The camels are unimpressed.       Bloom slouches into a bench.

 

                                                               23

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  At least you're honest.

     Bloom stares into space.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

                            BLOOM
                  `Do we have to go through this
                  again.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Then you make a show of putting on
                  your jacket and say `no I mean it
                  this time Stephen, this time I'm
                  really out.'

                            BLOOM
                  Then you say `let's have a drink,
                  and in the morning Bloom you'll
                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

                            STEPHEN
                      (re: Bloom's bright red
                       blood stain)
                  That's a major design flaw in fake
                  blood, by the way.

                            BLOOM
                  `and we'll be moving on.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Real blood turns brown after a half
                  hour.

                            BLOOM
                  Listen to me, Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  This scotch costs more than your
                  suit.

               Listen to me.

                         STEPHEN
               And the flask stopped a bullet from
               a black powder rifle at Appomattox.

                         BLOOM
               Listen.

     Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
     camel neck back and gulps it down.

                         STEPHEN
               That's my new favorite camel.

                         BLOOM
               I hate you. I hate this life, I
               hate it, I hate that you won't
               fucking listen to me for one
               goddamn second. Just listen.

     Stephen listens.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I can't wake up next to another
               stranger, who thinks they know me,
               or even wants to know me, cause I
               don't know - who - I'm thirty five
               years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
               crippled, I don't, I've only ever
               lived life through these roles that
               aren't me, that are written for me
               by you.

                         STEPHEN
               Tell me what you want.

                         BLOOM
               Why? So you can write me a role in
               a story where I get it? You're not
               listening to me. I want a real...
               thing, I wanna do things how I
               don't know are gonna work out, a,
               I, want, a...

                         STEPHEN

               You want an unwritten life.

                      (realizes Stephen just
                       wrote that line for him)
                  Aauuugghh god!

     The camel belches.    Bloom makes a show of putting on his
     jacket.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm going away. Somewhere you or
                  even the Chink won't be able to
                  track me down, so don't try. No
                  more stories.

     Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.    He gets
     about ten feet, then hesitates.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I love you. Bye.

     Then goes.

     The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
     Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

                               STEPHEN
                  Sorry bud.     I'm dry.

     Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
     mist, lost in thought.

     His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN:


49   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                49

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     TITLE CARD:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

                                                                26
  




50   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                50

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.


51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

                         STEPHEN
               She's right, you know.

                         BLOOM
               Why are you here, Stephen?

                         STEPHEN
               Put on your face, let's eat.


52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.


53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53

     A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
     The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

                         BLOOM
               How'd you find me?





                                                                    27

                  How'd the Chink find me?

     Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking?"

                            STEPHEN
                  How've you been?

                               BLOOM
                  Great.

                            STEPHEN
                  I've done a lot of thinking the
                  past three months. You don't want
                  out. You think you do but you
                  don't. Here, c'mere. I want to

                            BLOOM
                  I'm quits, Stephen.

     Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where are we going?

                      (sighs)
                  Well lemme get my jacket.

55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55

     A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
     ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  Looks like an etching from a Bronte
                  novel.

     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.
                  I'm gonna head back to Italy.

                            STEPHEN
                  Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
                  early, Mom died two years ago after
                  ten years fighting an illness that
                  I can't pronounce.

                              BLOOM
                  How much?

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Jesus.

                              STEPHEN
                  Look out.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.


56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56

     Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
     rental car, an old school Cadillac.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
     Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

                            BLOOM
                  What am I doing here, Stephen? I
                  have one rule, and you've never
                  even tested it.



 

                                                                   29

                  Stick with me.

                            BLOOM
                  No women. One rule. You know we
                  don't do women, I don't, and it's
                  not a morality thing or- a thing-
                  it's, whatever it is it doesn't
                  matter what it is, that's just our
                  rule. So what are we,
                      (RE: the rental car)
                  Did you rent a `78 Caddy?

     Stephen nods to the Chink.       Bloom nods appreciatively.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

                            STEPHEN
                  Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
                  Lived at home her whole life.

     Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.

                            BLOOM
                  An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
                  You're not helping your case.

     The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

                            STEPHEN
                  She's bored, a seed in the snow.
                  We're going to put her through a
                  grand adventure, bring her to life.

                            BLOOM
                  So this is the big plan. Lure me
                  back into things with some
                  beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
                  stir up old memories with the
                  prospect of redemption and rebirth.
                  Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.

     Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.



   

                                                              30

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I'm not saying yes. But what's the
               con?

     Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
     a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.

     Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

                         STEPHEN
               It's actually pretty simple. We're
               brothers, antique dealers, perusing
               the Americas for antiquities en
               route to someplace exciting via
               luxury steamer, say Greece. You
               tie into her and work your magic...

     Penelope plays on.


57   INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                                    57

     Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
     drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
     back of a chair.

     Bloom holds the con flowchart.

                         STEPHEN
               ...and so that's how it ends, in
               Mexico, a burst of violence then a
               moment of truth on the beach. What
               do you think?

     Bloom idly looks over the chart.

                         BLOOM
               You've got something up your
               sleeve. This is about me, right?
               Somehow.

                         STEPHEN
               This might not be something you
               know, but they've all been about
               you. Maybe that's why they've none
               of them been perfect, I've never
               been able to give you what you
               really want.






                                                                31

                            BLOOM
                  I want to be outta all this. So by
                  definition, this is not going to
                  give me what I want.

     Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                  This will be the last one.    You'll
                  let me go.

     The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
     feet, silently going to Stephen's side.

                            STEPHEN
                  I will never approach you to do
                  another con again.
                      (to the Chink)
                  Let's make it a red Schwinn.

     Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."


58   EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                      58

     A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
     Styrofoam helmet on his head.

     Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.

     The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
     cooler with Coronas.

                            BLOOM
                  There are less painful ways to cut
                  into a mark.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
                  Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
                  head in the game, the Chinese judge
                  is tough.

                            BLOOM
                  This is a banana seat, man!

     He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
     incomprehension and opens two Coronas.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Don't give me that blank look, you
                  know what a fuckin banana seat is.

 

                                                                   32
     
58   CONTINUED:                                                     58


     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

                                                            CUT TO:


59   EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY                                         59

     Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
     and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
     the wheel.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  There's actually a knack to this.
                  You want to avoid dying or breaking
                  anything that won't grow back, but
                  you don't want to roll out of it
                  and come up roses. If you're
                  trying to fast track into a mark's
                  sympathies, there's nothing quite
                  as efficient as having your first
                  conversation be from a hospital bed
                  they put you in. I usually like to
                  try for a dislocated shoulder.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

 

                                                                33
  
59   CONTINUED:                                                  59


     Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
     a stop. The horn blares.

     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.

     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -
     7.8.


60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60

     Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
     uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
     forward.

     Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you alright?


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61

     Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.

                            STEPHEN
                  The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
                  I know, thank you - in her report,
                  I missed it. This is actually kind
                  of great, I'll tell you why.

     The Chink lights a cigarette.

                            BLOOM
                  You missed it?

                            STEPHEN
                  Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

                            BLOOM
                  I know.

                            STEPHEN
                  His seizures were preceded by an
                  enlightened euphoria, a sort of
                  opening of his spiritual eye.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  I think the fact that she saw your
                  face the instant before a seizure
                  is a pretty goddamn good foot to
                  start things out on, right?

     Bloom stares blankly.        The Chink burps into her stethoscope.


62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62

     Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  The next step is to figure out a
                  way to insinuate yourself into
                  their personal life.

     Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.

     It is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think they took my car.     Could
                  you drive me home?

                                BLOOM
                  Uh.   Yeah.

     She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm Penelope Stamp.

                                BLOOM
                  Bloom.


63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63

     Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Engagement. Find a connection with
                  your mark through conversation.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm sorry about your Lamborghini.

                                PENELOPE
                  S' ok.

     Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
     angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.

  

                                                                      35

                      (beat)
                  Jersey.

     More silence.

                            PENELOPE
                  This car is like riding in a huge
                  marshmallow.

     And still more silence.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Having now deftly set your hook in
                  the mark's psyche, this would be
                  the perfect time to tug the line,


64   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING                                  64

     They pull up in the car.          A tow truck is dropping off a new
     Lamborghini.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Get invited in for coffee, and tell
                  them the full tale.

     Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
     drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
     dashboard.

                            PENELOPE
                  For the bike, and the whole, thing.
                  This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
                  Bye.

     The car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  However, there are advantages to
                  playing it cool. Letting it lie
                  for a day or two, then casually re-
                  establish contact.

     Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
     mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
     Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.

     He stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.

                  right?


65   INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
     all again. Three or four times.

                            BLOOM
                  ...didn't really have anyone except
                  each other growing up, and our
                  father was in the antique business,
                  he had a shop in Charleston. So we
                  stuck together, my brother Stephen
                  and me, we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died. Then we
                  realized one day, we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world, and there was a, almost a
                  scent they had, when they'd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen, the
                  air would, like before a rain, the
                  ions would line up, and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to Paris
                  and steamer ships and Calcutta
                  bazaars, and we made the decision,
                  we just did it, that we want to
                  have that sort of life. So we did,
                  and we've been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since, and could you, I'm sorry,
                  stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
                  Alright, look.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm really bad at talking to
                  people.






                                                                   37

66   INT. PARLOR                                                     66

     Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
     looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.

                            BLOOM
                  So what kind of stuff do you do?

                             PENELOPE
                  Nothing.   Maybe you should go.

                            BLOOM
                  Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
                  coffee first.

     Very slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and
     noisier slurp.

                            PENELOPE
                  I collect hobbies. I see someone
                  doing something I like, and I get
                  books and learn how to do it.

                             BLOOM
                  Hm.   Anything interesting?

                            PENELOPE
                  Not really.

     HOBBY MONTAGE

     In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting
     seriousness and skill for Bloom:

     Playing the piano.      The classical guitar.   The fiddle.   The
     banjo.

     Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.

     Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard.



   

                                                                    38

     Juggling various items.       Riding a unicycle.   Juggling while
     riding a unicycle.

     Karate chopping through too much wood.

     Breakdancing.

     Playing the accordion.

     Rapping to a drum machine.

     Creating a perfect origami dragon.

     END HOBBY MONTAGE

     On Bloom's shell-shock face.

                            BLOOM
                  Is that it?

                             PENELOPE
                  No.   I know a lot of stuff.

                            BLOOM
                  You just learned this stuff, here
                  by yourself?

                               PENELOPE
                  Kinda sad.

                            BLOOM
                  No. So you just thought, `so I
                  want to learn this and this,' and
                  you just did it? How do you plan
                  to use all these skills?

                            PENELOPE
                  I dunno. I'm not a planner. I
                  just do stuff. Here, look at this
                  watermelon. It's a camera. You
                  can make a pinhole camera out of
                  anything hollowish and dark.

                            BLOOM
                  It's gotta warp the image though,
                  right?




  

                                                              39

                         PENELOPE
               No, yeah it does. That's what -
               the Taj Majal taken by a fat
               tourist with diarrhea and a point-
               and-shoot camera can be the
               flattest, dullest, "here's us at
               the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go
               stick our thumbs up our asses"
               picture. But you can look at the
               most menial everyday thing, and
               depending on how your pinhole
               camera eats the light, it's warped
               and peculiar and imperfect. It's
               not reproduction, it's
               storytelling.

                         BLOOM
               It's a lie that tells the truth.

                         PENELOPE
               I dunno about truth. A photograph
               is a secret about a secret. The
               more it tells you, the less you
               know.

                         BLOOM
               What's changed between now and
               twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
               kinda like a conversation.

                           PENELOPE
               Huh.    Well shit.


67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67

     Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
     and ending up at the driveway.

                         BLOOM
               Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
               I meet a lot of people in my job I
               have to professionally act
               interested in. It's a good feeling
               to be genuinely interested in
               someone.

                         PENELOPE
               Are you leaving?

                           BLOOM
               Yeah.



                                                                40

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you coming back?

                            BLOOM
                  Well next time I'm in town. We're
                  taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
                  off the docks, to the continent for
                  a few months.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
     crosses her still face.

     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Paris and Greece, I think. I've
                  gotta get a hat. Thanks for the
                  pinhole camera demonstration. And
                  for the good conversation. Goodbye
                  Penelope.

                            PENELOPE
                  Goodbye Bloom.

     He drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go.


68   EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY                                        68

     A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the
     access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day with her.

                            STEPHEN
                  You'll have two weeks on the boat.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day to get her on
                  the boat, she isn't hooked. That
                  bit I skipped where we were talking
                  in the backyard, it was ten minutes
                  on the optics of lensless
                  photography, we didn't really talk.






                                                                    41

                            STEPHEN
                  It isn't the talking that hooked
                  her.

     Bloom turns from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  I think you're wrong.

     A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look.

                            BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Though every time I say that, you
                  end up being comically right.
                  That's her, isn't it? Yeah.

     Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
     fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

     Bloom meets her.

                              PENELOPE
                  Hey.

                              BLOOM
                  Hi.    What are you doing here?

     She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

                            PENELOPE
                  You left this money in my kitchen.

     He doesn't take it.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.

                              PENELOPE

                  Why did you decide to come?

                            PENELOPE
                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                            PENELOPE
                  It looked like fun.   I wanted to do
                  it.

                            BLOOM
                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
     gazing out to sea. He quickly turns Penelope away.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Here, this way.


71   EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD DECK - DAY                                 71

     The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard.     Bloom leads
     Penelope to them.

                            BLOOM
                  Penelope, this is my brother
                  Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're
                  the epileptic photographer?

                             PENELOPE
                  Sort of.

                            STEPHEN
                  This is my personal secretary and
                  masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.

     A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.

                            PENELOPE
                  Yuengling like the beer?

                  Heh. No. So what are your plans
                  in Greece?

                            PENELOPE
                  I don't plan.

                            STEPHEN
                  Good for you.

     The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
     gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.


72   INT. STATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    72

     The brothers dress for dinner.

                            BLOOM
                  You named the Chink `Yuengling?'

                            STEPHEN
                  I was writing in a bar. And she
                  doesn't drink, how does she know a
                  Philly beer?

                             BLOOM

                  Yes it was. Did he spot you?

     An ominous glance.

                  Not yet.

     Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
     and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
     elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.

                            BLOOM
                  You look very nice.

     She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.

                  Lucky guess.

     Penelope's hands move faster.     She knows how to shuffle
     cards.

                  Well it's funny how everyone's
                  usually got one.

     As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles.

                            PENELOPE
                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.

               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
               discovered what I was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.

                         BLOOM
               Do you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

                         PENELOPE
               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

                         THE CURATOR
               And a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My
               compliments.

     Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away.

                                                                 46
   




74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74

     They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.

                         PENELOPE
               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

                         BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
               I don't suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

                         BLOOM
               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

                         THE CURATOR
               Mademoiselle.

                           PENELOPE
               Monsieur.

                         THE CURATOR
                   (in French, subtitled)
               I didn't mean to startle you.

                         PENELOPE
                   (in French, subtitled)
               Yes you did.

                            THE CURATOR
                      (in French, subtitled)
                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,
                  and I had to approach.
                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                            THE CURATOR
                      (Cheshire grin)
                  Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.


75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75

     Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
     porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.






                                                              48

     His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
     lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
     marks on the stem.

     Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
     pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.




76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76

     The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
     beer can pinhole camera between them.

     Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.

     The Chink appreciates her.


77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77

     Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.

                            PENELOPE
                  How'd you find her?

                            BLOOM
                  The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She
                  found us.


78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78

     Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.

                            BLOOM (O.S.)
                  A few years back, when we hit the
                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

                                                              49





79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79

                         PENELOPE
               I like her.

                           BLOOM
               Good.

     They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.

     Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
     them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               What's he doing here?

                         STEPHEN
               I invited him, sit down. This
               ship's too small to dance around
               each other for a week, we might as
               well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
               Penelope, do you know our friend?

                         PENELOPE
               Only as the creepy Frenchman.

                         THE CURATOR
               Book-learned. You know languages
               but not accents, my dear. I am
               Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at
               your service.

               Also known in certain professional
               circles as the Curator.

                         PENELOPE
               Pleased to make your acquaintance.
               What do you do?

                         THE CURATOR
               I'm a curator, presently for the
               National Museum in Prague. And
               yourself?

               do?

                  We've gone straight, Max.

                             THE CURATOR
                  Pardon, but you do not ascend to
                  the grand heights of the Brothers
                  Bloom only to toss it all and sell
                  terra cotta to blue haired weekend
                  antiquers.

                  We did.   Eat your waffles.

                  But Mademoiselle appears...
                  confused. Perhaps she is unawares?

                            BLOOM
                  Eat your waffles, fat man.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
                  in fact the two most highly
                  respected art smugglers in the
                  western world?

                            STEPHEN
                  Were. We've been on the straight
                  for three years. So that's that.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Well, if that is that, then that is
                  indeed that. As you say.

     Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up.

                            PENELOPE

               Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
               couldn't place it, this ship is the
               Fidele, which was the ship in
               Melville's novel "The Confidence
               Man." So that's weird.

     Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable.

                         STEPHEN
               Huh.


80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80

     Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.

                         BLOOM
               I know you like to throw those
               clever little details in, but
               you've gotta watch that shit with
               her Stephen. She had a lot of time
               alone in that house, and she used
               it. She did the best Double Dutch
               Queens I've ever seen up on the
               deck last night.

                         STEPHEN
               Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
               cards.

                         BLOOM
               She had them in her purse and cut
               them in while I was folding my
               napkin.

                         STEPHEN
               Jesus.

                         BLOOM
               That's what I'm saying. She's
               different, she knows, sometimes it
               feels like she knows everything.
               Doesn't that worry you?

                         STEPHEN
               No. But something about her is
               worrying you plenty.

                         BLOOM
               She feels like one of your
               characters.



                                                                   52

                  The day I con you is the day I die,

                             BLOOM
                  I know that.
                      (beat)
                  How did you get the Belgian, on our
                  budget?

                            STEPHEN
                  He's beautiful, right?

                            BLOOM
                  I didn't expect him to actually be
                  Belgian.

                            STEPHEN
                  I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed.

     Stephen stands to go, then pauses.

                            STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I've always protected you, right?
                  The only real danger in this whole
                  play is that you'll actually fall
                  in love with her. Look at me.
                  Don't fall in love with her.


81   EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS                                     81

     The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
     alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
     with a look.

                             STEPHEN
                  Shut up.   I know what I'm doing.

     She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  This came through just now?

     The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received

     He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog

                  excess of eyes left in your head

     The good ship Fidele rounds the Rock of Gibraltar.


83   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                            83

     Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.

     She says this word like she's eating chocolate:

                            PENELOPE
                  Smugglers. It's like an adventure
                  story. Whose idea was it to go
                  straight?

                            BLOOM
                  Mine. Stephen always loved the
                  life. Then he was almost killed on
                  a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
                  heads like canned hams worked him
                  beyond all reason.


84   EXT. JAKARTA PIER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          84

     Stephen is set upon by two thugs.    He rushes them.

                            STEPHEN
                  Have at thee, you ham headed
                  bastards!

                                                             54

85   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                      85

                         BLOOM
               And I called it, that was it.

                           PENELOPE
               Scary.

                         BLOOM
               For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
               loved the idea that we were
               internationally infamous art
               smugglers, but I think deep down,
               same as me, he felt like we were
               putting on a persona, faking it.

                         PENELOPE
               Telling a story.

                         BLOOM
               He'd love to die on a job.
               Cornered at midnight on a run to
               Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
               his story so well it fulfills
               itself. It somehow would make it
               finally real for him.

                         PENELOPE
               That's kinda the thing we all want,
               right?

     He looks at her in the sun.

                         BLOOM
               Trying to get something real by
               telling yourself stories is a trap.
               Trust me on that one.

     Kalamata, if it matters.

     The Fidele docked in bright blue water. Our intrepid heroes
     stand aside a dusty road, surrounded by their luggage.

     The Curator approaches, tips his hat to them.

                         THE CURATOR
               Best of luck with the antiquing,

                  Mademoiselle. Mes restes d'offre.

     With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart.

                            BLOOM
                  My French is a little rusty, but I
                  believe he just told you `my offer
                  stands.'

                            PENELOPE
                  He came out of nowhere last night.

     Penelope taking air on the moonlit deck.     The Curator
     dissolves out of the darkness.

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  Whatever's in his pipe, it made me
                  thick.

     He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
     unheard words low and fast.

                  An 8th century prayer book.

                  From his museum in Prague, stashed
                  in the castle.

     Up to the base of the castle, through a grated hole in an
     ancient wall, into...

     A stunning illuminated manuscript lies open on a stone table.
     The Curator's hands close it gently and take it away.

                  A book of hours.

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
                  out of me so I don't know it that
                  well. So that's what he does, he
                  makes pieces in his collections
                  disappear, then sells them off via
                  a trusted middleman.

                  That's what he does.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wonder who's his fence?

                            BLOOM
                  Probably his Spanish guy, right?
                      (asks Penelope)
                  Did he say who's buying?

                            PENELOPE

                  A gentleman from Argentina. He's
                  quite sick, cancer in his bones,
                  and desperate for sentimental
                  reasons to own this piece while he
                  may.

                  one million, US. The Argentin...a
                  guy will pay two point five.

                             STEPHEN
                  Not bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  Is he legit?

                  The Curator? That's a relative
                  term. He's telling the truth.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm sorry you had to deal with that
                  guy.

     Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the
     back of a taxi.

     Bloom breathes.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
                  to try this. Let's be smugglers.
                  I think it'd be fun. We should do
                  this.

                             BLOOM
                  No.

                  Well first off, we don't have a
                  million dollars.

                            PENELOPE
                  I do, I've got, that's whatever.   I
                  mean a real reason.

                            BLOOM
                  This is real, it's dangerous, it
                  could go very bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think a little real danger might
                  suit me. I'm gonna do it.

               This is not an adventure story.

     Stephen reclines, hat on his face.    Bloom paces.

                         STEPHEN
               Take it easy. She's having fun,
               that's the point of this.

                         BLOOM
               She's making a flag for our
               "smugglers gang," man. She made me
               learn a secret smugglers handshake.
               Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
               she was writing, in the observation
               car? A letter? A journal? No.
               She is getting way too into this.

     Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
     thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.

     On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
     "Penelope the smuggler."

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               She's been singing the Smuggler
               Song since Athens.

                         STEPHEN
               What Smugglers Song?

                  isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
                  Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
                  Smuggler Song. With hand motions.

                            STEPHEN
                  The whole point of this was to
                  sweep her off her feet. Let her
                  enjoy it.

                            BLOOM

                            STEPHEN
                  Nothing lasts.

     Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
     face.


96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

     A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
     Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.

     Off Bloom's quizzical look:

                               PENELOPE
                  Smuggling.     From the snack car.

     They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
     sacks.

     Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.

     while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers.

                  I'm not paying for that.

     She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.

                             ATTENDANT
                  Ice?

     She says no with a look, they drink.

                            BLOOM
                  She made up the Smuggler Song.

     The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson.

                  I thought it was a Disney thing.

     The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
     by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.

     Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
     out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
     by.

                            PENELOPE

                  Yeah.

                            PENELOPE
                  So this is all like fuckin
                  `whatever' to you.

                            BLOOM
                  I usually drink with the Chink in
                  the snack car, play cards.

                            PENELOPE

     Oops.

                            BLOOM
                  Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
                  smuggler nickname.

                            PENELOPE
                  That's offensive.

                            BLOOM
                  I think if it were offensive to
                  her, she'd let us know.

                            PENELOPE
                  Do I get a smuggler nickname?

     Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
     band into Penelope's luggage.

                            BLOOM
                  No.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think you're constipated.   In
                  your fuckin soul.

     Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
     before giving up.

                            BLOOM
                  What?

                            PENELOPE
                  You've got a big load of grumpy
                  petrified poop up your ass, I'm
                  just calling you out on it. Yeah
                  I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so
                  you know what? I'm a fuckin
                  smuggler. If that's your thing,
                  fuckin tell it like you own it.
                  When you've got a spotlight in
                  front of your feet, man, fuckin
                  jump into it and dance the shit out
                  of it. Stop fuckin thinking so
                  much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
                  Fuck.

     A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
     the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Whoa.

                Shh.    I love thunderstorms.

      Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
      feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
      confused.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo

      Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
      against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
      falls harder.

      Penelope writhes.   Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.

      The door to her car latches, and Bloom is gone.

      Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.    He
      spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.

      A baroque spiral staircase, the spine of a high apartment
      building. Our intrepid four ring the bell beside an
      apartment door.

                   Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.

      Stephen pushes open the door, and an instant later a SHOTGUN
      BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.

      They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell are you, what do you

      The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
      draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
      the other. He squints at them.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   Ah. Good morning. Come in. I

      A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
      Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
      skin on his face.

                   Here, off the Basilica, are offices

                   those, an otherwise inaccessible
                   section of catacombs. And the

                             THE CURATOR
                   The book is already stolen. The
                   stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
                   the filing, red tape. As far as
                   the museum is concerned, the book
                   does not exist. I am the curator,
                   I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
                   baboosh, put the book in a
                   briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,
                   say, at two.

                             STEPHEN
                   Today.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Today is not a good day.

                             STEPHEN
                   Tomorrow. Now what about this
                   Argentinian.

                   Belguta Rioso. I get his file.

      They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
      unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
      forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.

                   From a private collection on the

                   Who painted it?

                             THE CURATOR
                   I don't know.

                   Why is it the last thing you see
                   every night, and the first thing
                   you see every morning?

                             THE CURATOR
                   That's a story. You have a minute?

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
      painting. Setting the stage.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   Well Rachel, like most monsters the
                   Golem was once a human. A boy,

                          THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago
                today. She was six. She went out
                to play one afternoon and vanished.

                                                                 68

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It was the first painting I
                `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
                some night the golem will come for
                me.


109   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER                   109

      Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope.

                          THE CURATOR
                Mademoiselle.

      Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on
      the staircase. The Curator comes out.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It is you I do business with, yes?

                           PENELOPE
                Right.   Oh, right.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      He lets go, and smiles apologetically.

                             THE CURATOR
                Au revoir.

                                                                 69
   




110   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                  110

      Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded,
      vibrant cobblestone streets.

                          PENELOPE
                You aren't constipated. You're
                scared. What are you scared of?

      They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.

      As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
      holding off. Penelope notices why.


111   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        111

      Stephen, up in the window watching them approach.   He recedes
      into the room.


112   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                                112

      The sun sets against the castle, taking us into night.


113   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                              113

      Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil.
      A smell breaks his concentration.

                          BLOOM
                Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
                cane.

      Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
      eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.

                           DIAMOND DOG
                Bloom. How long has it been?
                     (sits, orders)
                Tea.
                     (to Bloom)
                Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
                long while.

                          BLOOM
                If I call Stephen down he'll kill
                you.





                                                                  70
    
113   CONTINUED:                                                  113


                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Well then please don't call Stephen
                   down. Look at you, you're
                   terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   It's been a funny thing, watching
                   you boys take what I taught you and
                   eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
                   footnote in the lives of the
                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

                             BLOOM
                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

                             BLOOM
                   Don't touch me.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.



   

                                                               71
 
113   CONTINUED: (2)                                           113


                          BLOOM
                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

                          DIAMOND DOG
                But love, you know. We know, folks
                like us, you can always blink and
                realize that it's a fiction, and
                like Peter walking on water or
                Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
                if you look down in doubt you'll
                fall. That's the price of our
                lives, the wax in our wings. One
                day Stephen's going to fall. It
                may be glorious, but he's going to
                fall hard and he won't be there to
                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.


114   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL - NIGHT                                  114

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

                                                                72
  




115   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                               115

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

                          STEPHEN
                I'm sorry I wasn't there.

                          BLOOM
                You can't always be there.

                          STEPHEN
                No, I guess can't.

      A beat.

                          BLOOM
                That was a real tonal shift.    The
                Curator's tale.

      On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
      other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
      "#14 - Castle Break-In."

                          STEPHEN
                I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
                didn't write it for him, though.

                          BLOOM
                He made it up on the spot?

                          STEPHEN
                I don't know.


116   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                           116

      Bloom flops into bed.   He turns and looks at the wall.

      Right on the other side of it...


117   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                   117

      Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.   She closes
      her eyes.

                                                                  73
    




118   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             118

      Bloom's breathing slows.   He closes his eyes.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.


119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119

      Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
      step judiciously back. No response.

                           STEPHEN
                Max?

                          BLOOM
                We're a little early...


120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

                          PENELOPE
                The Golem came for him. In my
                dream. Crawled out of the painting
                and killed him in a horrible way.






                                                                74

                             BLOOM
                   Well at least he had the decency to
                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)
                   You're a little early.

      Bloom quickly closes it.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't get it. If he was
                   hightailing it he could have waited
                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to
                   antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
                   lost.
                       (to Penelope)
                   And you got to see Prague, which is
                   nice.

      Penelope's eyes widen with realization.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.

                             BLOOM
                   You should stay in the city for
                   awhile, they have these amazing
                   puppet show opera things-

      But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh?


121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121

      Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
      hand. All heads are slumped.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.





                                                                    75
      
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121


                             BLOOM
                   It's my fault. I can't believe I
                   left you alone with him.

      The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it.

                             STEPHEN
                   The check was cashed yesterday
                   afternoon, he'd have deposited it
                   in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.

                             PENELOPE
                   What a waste.

      Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor man. What a waste.

      Bloom's expression turns quizzical.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor Argentina man. He'll
                   never see the book now, it'll just
                   rot in the catacombs. What a
                   waste.

      When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
      of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.


122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122

      Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
      The Chink and Stephen stand by.

                             BLOOM
                   No. No no. Can't you see what
                   happened here, there is no book,
                   we've been swindled -

                             PENELOPE
                   But maybe there is, maybe it's
                   real, we don't know!

                             BLOOM
                   It's not real, it's a con.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's my money, I'm going to find
                   out for sure. He gave us every
                   piece of information we need.

  

                                                                  76

      She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
      right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'd need to clear the
                   administrative offices.   Some sort
                   of disruption.

      The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.

                             PENELOPE
                       (to Bloom)
                   C'mon. Help me break into this
                   castle. It'll be fun.


123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123

      A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
      theatrical plume of fire.

      Several others follow suit.

      The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
      goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
      detonator plunger.

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

                             STEPHEN
                   She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
                   It's kind of her thing.

                              PENELOPE
                   I feel like I want to know more
                   about her.



                    BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Yeah.                             Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   Check the tat.

      On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
      of Chinese.






                                                                77
  
123   CONTINUED:                                                123


                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   An inky wisp of personal
                   information. We transcribed it,
                   brought it into a Chinese
                   restaurant.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's it say?

                             BLOOM
                   The literal translation is
                   something about water cranes, but
                   essentially it means "When you're
                   done with something, blow it up."


124   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING               124

      The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      Penelope appreciates her.

      Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.

                             STEPHEN
                   There's a smoke detector in these
                   empty rooms in the east tower. So
                   we plant and set off a tiny -
                       (to the Chink)
                   TINY tiny, tiny charge.

      The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
      BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
                   and you'll have exactly four and a
                   half minutes to get through the
                   access hatch, into the catacombs,
                   get the book and get out before the
                   fire department arrives.

      Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
      gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.

                                                                  78
    




125   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                             125

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

                          BLOOM
                So straight down the corridor,
                again, tell me where.

                          PENELOPE
                Second left, third right, access
                hatch behind the copier, I need to
                sleeeeeeep...

                          BLOOM
                The abort code if we need to abort
                is "corned beef." For some reason.

                          PENELOPE
                Bloom, I need to sleep.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

                            BLOOM
                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

                          PENELOPE
                You know what I feel?

                            BLOOM
                Horny?

                          PENELOPE
                Scared. All my big talk.       But this
                isn't a story, it's real.      Fuckin
                scary.

      She kisses him.    He kisses her back.






                                                                 79

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.


126   EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN                                         126

      The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.


127   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN                   127

      Bloom half wakes.

      Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.   Sunlight
      on her body and her sleeping face.

      Distant KNOCKING.     From the next room over.

      Bloom's eyes snap open.    He scampers.


128   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS           128

      In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
      swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.


129   INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS           129

      He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.

                             STEPHEN
                   Ready?


130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130

      The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.


131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131

      Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.


132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132

      A little alcove with a good view of the castle.

 

                                                               80

      Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
      Eastern tower. Bloom paces.


133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.


134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134

      Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.

                              STEPHEN
                   Ok.

      He looks through his binoculars again.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright?

                              PENELOPE
                   Ok.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

                             BLOOM
                   For the record, I'm still against
                   this. Why send her in alone?

      The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.

                             STEPHEN
                   Because going in alone is a very
                   important thing to do. She's
                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.



                                                                       81

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Cause nobody's going to know we
                   were ever here.

      Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right.

                               BLOOM
                   Uh-

      The Chink clicks the pen.


135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135

      The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.


136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

                               THE CHINK
                   Fuck me.

      Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.


137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137

      Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
      Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.

      The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
      out.


138   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                               138

                             BLOOM
                   Don't do it don't do it Penelope
                   don't-



     

                                                                  82

                   They're locking down the castle,
                   she won't get in.


139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139

      She takes a step towards the door.


140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140

      Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.


141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141

      A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
      tourists and smoking a cigar.

                             SECURITY GUARD
                   To ze back, no panic, to ze back...

      He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
      moment. Penelope spots it.


142   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          142

      Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.

                             BLOOM
                   Pen! Don't - abort!   Corned beef!
                   Corned beef!


143   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 143

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

                                                                 83
   




144   INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY                         144

      Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.   Penelope
      weaves through the halls.


145   INT. COPY ROOM - DAY                                       145

      Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.

      Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
      machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
      wall.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
                lips off to break into a castle in
                Prague.

      Revealing an access hatch.


146   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            146

      Tiny, earthy.   Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.

      Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
      lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
      HOURS reverently.


147   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                  147

      A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
      scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
      tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
      the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
      hands.


148   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            148

      Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
      around her, soldiers searching the castle.

      Voices right outside the hatch.   She slides the wimpy little
      bolt shut. It rattles.

      She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.

                                                               84
 




149   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                149

      Bloom suddenly stands.

                          BLOOM
                Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
                fine. If the soldiers find her
                wandering the halls they'll assume
                she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
                her out. So as long as she doesn't
                do anything suspicious, she's fine.


150   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    150

      Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
      shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!


151   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         151

      A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
      guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.

      It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
      through it, but exactly where that person is.

      The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.


152   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    152

      Penelope freezes.   A beat of silence.

      The tin gives way, and she plummets...


153   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY                                153

      ...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
      through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
      soldier in the head.

      Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.




                                                                    85

      And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
      plastic bag in her teeth.

      She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.      Lets the bag drop
      from her teeth.

      And opens her mouth to speak.


154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154

      The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
      from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
      sit watching for some sign.

      Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
      the bridge.

                             BLOOM
                   The Chief of Police.

      As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
      shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
      mesh in the back seat.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.

                             CHIEF OF POLICE
                       (in Czech)
                   It has been a privilege, madame, to
                   behold even briefly such a strong,
                   beautiful flower.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Czech)
                   Thank you sir, I will not soon
                   forget your kindness.

      She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
      back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.

  

                                                                    86
      
154   CONTINUED:                                                    154


      The police cars drive off.

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

                              PENELOPE (cont'd)
                       (sings)
                   We're a band of smugglers hey,
                   la la la la la,
                   we smuggle by night, drink by day,
                   smugglers ho, ho ho...
                   Everybody!


155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155

      Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.

      The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.

                             STEPHEN
                   Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
                   till eight.

                             BLOOM
                   That was real.

                             STEPHEN
                   Yeah, I know.

                             BLOOM
                   Fuckin scary.


156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.


  

                                                                   87
     
156   CONTINUED:                                                   156


      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.


157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157

      Stephen bails Bloom out.

                               STEPHEN
                   An apple?

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah, but it was part of an
                   epiphany.


158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158

      The train thunders South, towards Greece.


159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159

      Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
      and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
      two mini bottles of gin.

      He kisses her.


160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160

      Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
      through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
      into her suitcase.

      A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.


161   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                161

      The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

 

                                                                 88

      Stephen stands on the deck.      Bloom joins him.

                             STEPHEN
                   Mexico.

      He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.


162   EXT. DECK - DAY                                            162

      Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
      Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
      Taylors, sunning herself.)

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
                   Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
                   isolated beach just south of the
                   Mexican port town Tampico. A
                   simple handoff. Penelope and
                   Yeungling will stay with the car,
                   Bloom and I will do the handing.

                             PENELOPE
                   You guys seem a little tense.

                             STEPHEN
                   Well I'm not thrilled they set this
                   in Mexico. There could be
                   legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
                   and I don't want to simplistically
                   vilify an entire country, but
                   Mexico's a horrible place. So
                   we'll be careful.


163   EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON                         163

      The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
      center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.


164   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS                    164

      The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.

      The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.

                             PENELOPE
                   Is this going to be more dangerous
                   than I think, tomorrow?


 

                                                               89
 
164   CONTINUED:                                               164


                             BLOOM
                   Yeah. You should sleep at the
                   hotel tonight, I'll stay with
                   Stephen at the beach house. You'll
                   need sleep.

      On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
      a palm tree falls over.

                             PENELOPE
                   I'm really happy right now.   Are
                   you?

                             BLOOM
                   Right now I am.

      She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
      smuggler song.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Penelope...

      But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
      can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
      she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.


165   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                  165

      Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
      window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.

      Stephen picks up the con flowchart.

                             STEPHEN
                   The last box in our last con. Let
                   them begin the beguine. How's it
                   feel?

                             BLOOM
                   She's something special, Stephen.

                              STEPHEN
                   Uh huh.

                              BLOOM
                   Can I...

      He stares at his drink.


 

                                                                    90

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Can I just have a little more time?
                   Just a few days. I want to keep
                   her, like this, I don't want this
                   to just end. Don't make me do
                   this.

                             STEPHEN
                   Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
                   Don't be pathetic. Make you?
                   Jesus. I told you not to fall for
                   her-

                             BLOOM
                   I'm not gonna do this.

      Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
      in the eye. Finds his answer.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't believe you.

      He goes back to packing.


166   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            166

      Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
      hotel before him. Growing determination.


167   EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    167

      Bloom knocks on a door.       Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

                                PENELOPE
                   Hey.

                             BLOOM
                   I know what I've gotta do. I've
                   gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
                   shoes?

                                PENELOPE
                   What's up?

      He pulls her out of the room.


168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168

      Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.

  

                                                                91

                   Bloom.   What?

      Deep breath.

                             BLOOM
                   My brother and I are con men. All
                   things considered, we might be the
                   most respected con man team working
                   today. And everything since you
                   hit me with your Lamborghini, all
                   of this, it's all fake. It's all a
                   con.


169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169

      The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
      Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
      inside and turns out the light.


170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170

                             BLOOM
                   No, we were going to blow you off
                   tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
                   it's a, term, we have actors
                   playing the Argentina guy's men,
                   when we showed up the deal would go
                   bad, they would open fire on us,
                   Stephen and I would pretend to be
                   shot using blood packets, squibs.
                   That's - cackle bladder, in the old
                   days they put fake blood in chicken
                   bladders, so... So you'd escape
                   with the Chink, she'd send you off
                   with a little travelling money and
                   that would be that.

                              PENELOPE
                   Wow.

                             BLOOM
                   But that's not how this one's going
                   to end. I love you now, and I want
                   to get you out of this. I'm going
                   to do what I have to do to get you
                   out of this, away from all this for
                   good. Are you ready?

                                                                   92

      Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.

                           BLOOM
                 Stephen's gone into town to prep
                 the Argentina actors. Your money's
                 at his place.

                           PENELOPE
                 Money? I don't want the money,
                 let's just leave.

      For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead.

                              BLOOM
                 C'mon.


172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172

      Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
      switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.

                           STEPHEN (O.S.)
                 You have to switch it on at the
                 base.

      A beat.   Bloom does.

      Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not
      angry. Much more sad than angry.

                           BLOOM
                 So I've told her our whole play.
                 And I'm here. To take her money
                 back. How's that make you feel?

                           STEPHEN
                 Disappointed.

                           BLOOM
                 This isn't the ending you wanted?

                           STEPHEN
                 It doesn't matter now. This is the
                 way it ends. So let's get it over
                 with.

                           BLOOM
                 Where's the money?

 

                                                                    93

                               STEPHEN
                   I ate it.

                             BLOOM
                   Give me the money, Stephen.

                               STEPHEN
                   No.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't want the money.

                             BLOOM
                   He's not going to keep a single
                   piece of you.

      Stephen stands.

                             STEPHEN
                   I'm sorry you fell in love with
                   her. But she's a mark. And all of
                   this, all of it is a con. Every
                   moment you shared with her, you
                   were just playing the part of a man
                   falling in love. That's what
                   you're afraid of, right? That you
                   don't know the difference? Or
                   maybe that there is no difference.
                   That that's what love is.

                             PENELOPE
                   We're leaving.

                             STEPHEN
                       (to Bloom)
                   No. You're too scared to leave.
                   You're scared to ride off into a
                   sunset that isn't painted
                   tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
                   beautiful but they turn into dark
                   uncertain nights. If you were
                   ready for that, you wouldn't be
                   here. The money is in my bedroom.
                   Right behind me. But in my story
                   you don't get the money or the
                   sunset or the girl.

      A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.

                               PENELOPE
                   Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please.

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

                             BLOOM
                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

                             PENELOPE
                Bloom...

      He doesn't move from his brother.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                I'm sorry.

      She leaves.




                                                                 95

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.


173   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                    173

      A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.   Bloom
      watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.

      Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.

                             STEPHEN
                Hey.
                    (nothing)
                I think that was the most honest
                conversation we've ever had.
                    (more nothing)
                You actually connected on a few of
                those punches.

                          BLOOM
                Did you expect me to do it? To
                come here tonight, end it the way
                you wrote it? Or were you really
                disappointed I didn't run off with
                her?

                           STEPHEN
                I was disappointed.    But I wasn't
                surprised.

      Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.   Stephen falls to the
      sand.

                          BLOOM
                I let you do your monologue, but
                you wanna know why I did it? I did
                it so she'd never want to see me
                again. To get her away from all
                this for good.


 

                                                               96

      Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
      opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
      the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.

                                                       FADE OUT.

      TITLE CARD - 3 months later.


174   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - DAY                               174

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.

      BEEP.

      The mansion EXPLODES, completely.

      She walks away without looking back.

      After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
      fireball.


175   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                             175

      Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
      A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
      up into the city.


176   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                             176

      Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
      groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
      Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
      with Italian curses and hand gestures.

      Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

                            PENELOPE
                   Hello.




                                                                97

                                BLOOM
                   Hey.

      The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
      groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
      back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
      up of approval.


177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177

      Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find me?

                                PENELOPE
                   The Chink.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find the Chink?

                             PENELOPE
                   She gave me her cell when we got to
                   Mexico.

                             BLOOM
                   I didn't even know she had one.

                             PENELOPE
                   I think she's kind of selective in
                   who she gives the number to.


178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178

      They sit with wine and bread.

                             BLOOM
                   Why are you here, Penelope?

                             PENELOPE
                   Why did you decide to stay with
                   your brother instead of coming with
                   me in Mexico?

                             BLOOM
                   Everything Stephen said that night
                   was true.






                                                                   98

                             PENELOPE
                   I've been doing a lot of thinking
                   the past three months. I want you
                   to consider something.

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.

                             BLOOM
                   Go away. Everything Stephen said
                   was true. I was just playing you
                   as a mark. Everything between us,
                   none of it was real.

      She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't believe you.

      It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.


179   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                                  179

      Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings.

                             BLOOM
                   Pick up... c'mon...


180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180

      Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
      overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
      posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
      phone chirps away.

      Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

      Stephen hastily answers it.



   

                                                                99

                   How quickly can you get to
                   Ferentino?

                             STEPHEN (ON PHONE)
                   Uh... Nine-ish?

      Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright.

      Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
      stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.

183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183

      Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
      apartment.

                             STEPHEN
                   So she comes back wanting to work
                   with us. Honestly? I think we'd
                   be lucky to have her. If you
                   called me to hear my opinion on the
                   matter. Which I'm getting the
                   feeling you didn't.

                             BLOOM
                   I did what I did in Mexico to get
                   her out of all this. I would rather
                   die than bring her into the con.

                             STEPHEN
                   So maybe you want to tell me what
                   I'm doing in Ferentino.






                                                                 100

                             BLOOM
                   You knew she'd come back. What did
                   you figure she was good for,
                   another million?

                             STEPHEN
                   One point seven five.

                             BLOOM
                   We will play her again, one last
                   con, but not for money. I'm gonna
                   tell you how this one's gonna end.
                   You built us into this, you're
                   gonna fly us out, end it so she's
                   done with all of us. End it all so
                   it can't start up again.

                             STEPHEN
                   You want me to plan a con whose
                   sole purpose is to blow her off for
                   good?

                             BLOOM
                   I love her. You owe me this. I
                   don't want to turn her into me.

      Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.

      Bloom enters wearily.    Sits in a chair.   Watches her.

      In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.    Shuffling
      cards.

      A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
      segueing us into...


185   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                    185

      On a television screen, images of the Shanghai skyline.

      TITLE CARD - Shanghai

      A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
      singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.

      As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
      Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.


 

                                                               101
  
185   CONTINUED:                                                185


      The Chink's face betrays just the slightest hint of
      disappointment.


186   INT. KARAOKE BAR PRIVATE BOOTH - LATER                    186

      The four sit with drinks.

                             PENELOPE
                   So what's the next job?

                             STEPHEN
                   Before we do the next job, we need
                   to liquidate our assets from the
                   last job.

                             PENELOPE
                   But you've got-

                             STEPHEN
                   Your money from the last job, well
                   that's profit, not capital, the
                   three of us have already split it
                   up. So step one: sell the book of
                   hours.

                             PENELOPE
                   I thought it was fake.

                             STEPHEN
                   With all your random expertise we
                   couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
                   isn't worth two point five million,
                   we could maybe catch four hundred
                   grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
                   we buy it from?

                              BLOOM
                   Minskie.

                             STEPHEN
                   Perfect, we'll sell it right back
                   to him.

      The Chink hands him a piece of paper.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   If he wasn't dead.

                             BLOOM
                   Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
                   Roche, if we want to go state-side.



                                                                  102
     
186   CONTINUED:                                                   186


                             STEPHEN
                   All traceable. With Minskie out
                   we'd have to go deep black market
                   if we wanted to be a hundred
                   percent clear. There's only one
                   place that's deep enough for that.

      Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
      they don't look happy.

                              PENELOPE
                   Where?


187   INT. KARAOKE BAR BACK ROOM - LATER                           187

                             BLOOM
                   Russia. It's like `cancer', I
                   don't even like saying the word.

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
      concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.

                             STEPHEN
                   We're obviously not going to deal
                   with real Russians. They'll be our
                   guys in a phony set up, they'll
                   take our phony book and give her
                   phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
                   and simple.

      Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.      Gets a blank face.

                              STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So.   We go to St. Petersburg.

      At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
      Stephen, but Stephen presses on.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   She does the hand-off with our fake
                   "Russians." But while we're
                   driving out of town, everything
                   goes bad.

      He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
      He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"




 

                                                                103
   
187   CONTINUED:                                                 187


                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   We discover we were sold a
                   counterfeit book in the first
                   place, which we've now sold to
                   Russian smugglers. We discover
                   this when the Russian mob starts
                   taking us out one by one. Oh shit.

      He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   First they ambush our car,
                   destroying the money. Then they
                   take me out, then the Chink, and
                   finally you Bloom, in a heroic
                   death that allows Penelope to
                   barely escape with her life.
                   Devastated but reborn with the
                   knowledge that you loved her so
                   much you died so she could live,
                   she drives off into a romantic life
                   of adventure and peril, on the run
                   from imaginary Russians.

      He points to the third box, "The End."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   What do you think?

                                                          CUT TO:


188   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNSET                                 188

      The blood red sun sets over the city.


189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189

      Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack.

      The phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Our "Russians" have arrived.


190   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                        190

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a
      red suitcase.


 

                                                                104

                   Who'd you get, anyway?

                              STEPHEN
                   Hm?

                             BLOOM
                   To play the "Russians?"

      DING.

      The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   My boys.


191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191

      Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
      waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
      Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.


192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192

                             BLOOM
                   I don't understand. Tell me so I
                   understand. Three months ago you
                   were ready to blind the old bastard-

                             STEPHEN
                   We need someone who can pass for
                   the Russian mob to buy our fake
                   book. The Dog's got his big store
                   right here in St. Petersburg.

                             BLOOM
                   Alright, fuckin stop. You want
                   this to finish in St. Petersburg,
                   you want this to end with the Dog
                   for some what thematic something?
                   Fine but don't tell it like a
                   story, let's say it. Twenty three
                   years ago and I can still smell,
                   that blood red apartment of his,
                   the smell of that place. I hate
                   him Stephen but this isn't that,
                   this is I don't trust him.




 

                                                                  105

                   What's he gonna do? Steal our fake
                   money?
                       (beat)
                   I've thought this one out, believe
                   me. And we can't end it without
                   him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.


193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193

      The red leather suitcase on the bar.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Stephen, still the grand architect
                   with your symbols. Red for
                   temptation, white for salvation.

      The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a
      loupe.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   Impressive, boys.

                             BLOOM
                   It's trash. There's visible cross
                   hatching in Franklin's eye.

      Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
      Franklin's eye on the bills.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Hm.  I'll be damned.
                       (closes case)
                   Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
                   handing over a rag bag like this,
                   it should be a steel attache.

                               STEPHEN
                   This'll   do. We'll do the drop off
                   at your   store. Make it scary,
                   think a   movie version of the
                   Russian   mafia, but don't hassle
                   her.

                               DIAMOND DOG
                   Alright.

      The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
      on his bandaged hand.

      He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.

 

                                                                  106

194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194

      The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

                             STEPHEN
                   So. Our fake Russian attack. One
                   small charge will simulate a bullet
                   hit, and blow out the back window.

      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
      the rear windshield.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So that one bang, then we roll off
                   the road. Once we get clear of the
                   car the Chink sets off the final
                   charge, incinerating the car and
                   the money in the trunk. This'll
                   all happen exactly twenty seconds
                   after we cross the main bridge out
                   of town. After the bridge.

      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
      jacket.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.


195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195

      Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is
      expressionless.

                             BLOOM
                   You've been awful quiet.

      She doesn't react.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   I'm doing this for her.

      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.

                                                                   107
      




196   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM                                    196

      Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
      looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.

                          PENELOPE
                Tomorrow it all starts.

      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
      for the last time.

      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.


197   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE                                 197

      The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city.


198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
      doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.

      Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.

                          BLOOM
                She gives the Dog the book, he
                gives her the fake money. This is
                taking too long.

      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.


199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199

      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.

                          PENELOPE
                He hassled me. Took forever
                looking the book over, haggled the
                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.

      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.

                           STEPHEN
                Alright.   Let's get the hell out of
                Russia.


  

                                                                 108

      Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
      last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
      lake.


200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200

      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.


201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201

      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.

      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.

      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.

      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.

      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.

      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
      screams, tires screeching.


202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202

      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.

      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
      full speed, launching into the air.


203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203

      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The
      brothers lock eyes for a split second.


204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204

      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
      abrupt stop against a stout tree.




                                                                   109

                             STEPHEN
                   OUT!

      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.


205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205

      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.
      Penelope hunches over him.

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Are you alright?

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Yeungling went to get another car.

                             BLOOM
                   Where's Stephen?

                             PENELOPE
                   We don't know. He was gone.

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he
                   escaped, he'll contact us. If
                   they've got him, it's for ransom.


  

                                                                110

                             BLOOM
                   Who's got him?

                             PENELOPE
                   The Russians.

      The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.


206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, god please what's
                   happening. I don't know what to
                   do. I don't know Stephen please.
                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

                             BLOOM
                   If you know what's happening, now
                   would be a really good time to
                   speak up.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No, please. Not now. I need your
                   help here now, I don't know what to
                   do.

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.



 

                                                                    111

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
      happened.


207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207

      A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago,
      Illinois."

      On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.


208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208

      A dive.   The chef on the phone.

                             CHEF
                   Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok.

                               ALL THE COOKS
                   Blooooom!

      He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
      spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.


209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209

      Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.




   

                                                               112

                             BLOOM
                   Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok.
                   So I've got "We are all assholes in
                   our own theatrical enterprises."
                   You sure?

      This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.

                             CHEF
                   And then it end with "Goodbye shit
                   head."

                                BLOOM
                   Shit head?

                             CHEF
                   But it is different meaning in
                   Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
                   head" if you have affection for
                   shit.


210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210

      The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
      Bloom sits next to her.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it mean?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it say?

                             BLOOM
                   "We're all of us marks in our own
                   cons." And she said goodbye.

                             PENELOPE
                   I still can't believe it.

                             BLOOM
                   That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
                   Neither can I.

                             PENELOPE
                       (hopeful)
                   What? Oh, oh god do you think she
                   faked it? So the Russians would
                   think she was dead?



                                                                   113

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where are you going?

                             BLOOM
                   This wasn't Russians. This was
                   done by an old mentor of ours who
                   wants us off the map. He has an
                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So
                   this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
                   to that apartment to face the Dog
                   and get my brother back. That's
                   how I'm gonna end this.

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
      and Bloom stops her with a weary look.

                             PENELOPE
                   We can skip the whole you-sending-
                   me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-
                   leave-your-side-thing.

                             BLOOM
                   Thank Christ.


211   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - LATE MORNING                     211

      A narrow alley between tall apartments.    Bloom parks, pulls
      his gun and checks it.




  

                                                                     114

212   INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY                                   212

      A badly lit apartment hallway.       Bloom approaches a door,
      Penelope behind him.

      His breathing becomes hard.        His face contorts.   He crumples
      next to the door.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's in there? Tell me who this
                   guy is.

      Bloom's breathing steadies.

                             BLOOM
                   He's just an old man.

      He tries the knob.     It opens.


213   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D                                213

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes
      through his nose, chokes.

                              BLOOM
                   Dog!   I came back.

      He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.         Empty.

      He lowers his gun, switches on the light.

      Penelope enters.     Sniffs the air.

                             PENELOPE
                   Moth balls.

      Bloom almost laughs.

                             BLOOM
                   Is that what that smell is?

      BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
      of a double barrel shotgun.

    

                                                                   115

      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Russian)
                   It's okay. Honey, it's alright.

      The shotgun sinks to the ground.      Penelope strokes his hair
      back from his face.

      Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him if anyone else is here.

      She does.

                             BOY
                   Nyet.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.

                             PENELOPE
                   Diamond Dog?
                       (in Russian)
                   Where is the Diamond Dog?

                             BOY
                       (in English)
                   The Dog of Diamonds is gone.

      Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
      does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
      gets a quick answer.

                             BLOOM
                   Get the car started.

                             PENELOPE
                   What about him?

                             BLOOM
                   It's alright.



  

                                                               116

      She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the
      boy.

                          BLOOM (cont'd)
                You don't need to be afraid of him
                anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
                come back here again. He doesn't
                concern you anymore. Understand?
                It's gonna be ok.

      The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
      the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.


214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
      Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.

      He sprints towards her, screaming

                           BLOOM
                Get out!   Get out of the car!!

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      The Mercedes roars off down the street.

      Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.

      Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
      nesting doll.


215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215

      The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
      seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
      Penelope holds a note.

                          PENELOPE
                It's a ransom note. It says they
                have Stephen, it says they want the
                money wired to a specific account,
                they give a bank to do it at and a
                manager to ask for.

                   Then an address to come to, at two
                   p.m. In two hours.

                             BLOOM
                   I'll wire the money from my
                   account, and we'll go get Stephen.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's a lot.

                               BLOOM
                   How much?

                             PENELOPE
                   I'll do it, I want to, I've got
                   plenty-

                             BLOOM
                   How much are they asking for?

                             PENELOPE
                   One point seven five million.

      A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.

                              BLOOM
                   Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO.

      He punches the dashboard.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if
                   that's what this is, if that's all
                   that this is, no NO NO.

                             PENELOPE
                   What are you talking about?

                             BLOOM
                   There's another possibility that I
                   should of, I'm a fucking idiot.
                   This might all be a con. By my
                   brother. To get me - oh god - he
                   wanted me to face the Dog, to end
                   it, and he gets your money. Oh
                   god. I'm going to be sick.

                             PENELOPE
                   Would he do that? To you?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know. Yes.   Yes of course
                   he would.

                          PENELOPE
                But you don't know. Let's transfer
                the money. You don't know.

216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216

      Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
      again, helpless enraged and scared.

      Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

                          PENELOPE
                Ok.


217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

                           BLOOM
                I'm so scared. Anything I can
                imagine finding in there, I'm
                scared of.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm going to be here when you come
                out.

      She kisses him.

      He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes.

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
      Goes in alone.

                                                               119
  




218   INT. THEATER LOBBY                                            218

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!


219   INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM                                       219

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.


220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

                          BLOOM
                    (unsteady)
                Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
                Let's blow this one hat town.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...




                                                                120

                              STEPHEN
                   No!   No Bloom, freeze.

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

                             STEPHEN
                   Did Penelope wire the money?

                              BLOOM
                   Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

                              BLOOM
                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Stephen!



                                                                 121

                              STEPHEN
                 Stay back!

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

                           BLOOM
                 Please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.

                           STEPHEN
                 You said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?

                           BLOOM
                 You son of a bitch.




                                                               122

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?

                           BLOOM
                Yeah.   Clean exit.

                            STEPHEN
                How?

                            BLOOM
                Car bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.

                          STEPHEN
                Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.

                            BLOOM
                Soon?

                          STEPHEN
                I hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.

                          BLOOM
                I love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.

                            STEPHEN
                Hey.    Think of any card.

                              BLOOM
                 Alright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.

                           STEPHEN
                 You're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.


221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221

      Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...


222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222

      Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.

                                                                  124

      Bloom wakes with a start.

                            PENELOPE
                  Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.

                               BLOOM
                  Pull over.     Pull over!!

      She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.

                            PENELOPE
                  What is it? You're scaring me-

                            BLOOM
                  What did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache

      Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.

                             PENELOPE
                   How long had he been alone.

                             BLOOM
                   And what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.

                             PENELOPE
                   Since yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.

                             BLOOM
                   This is real. They hassled you.

                             PENELOPE
                   Bloom-

                   The Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.


225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.

                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.

                And they came after us.   And
                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                          BLOOM
                Stephen saved my life.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                             BLOOM
                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

                          PENELOPE
                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.

                   We're gonna outrun these bastard
                   Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide
                   out in Rio, then we're gonna live
                   like we're telling the best fucking
                   story in the world. Are you ready?

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

                             BLOOM (V.O.)
                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.

      Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
      The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.

               EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically 
               hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest 
               are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain.

               FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting 
               for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each 
               other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's 
               desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand.

                                     EVAN
                              (as he writes)
                         If anyone finds this, then I guess 
                         my plan didn't work and I'm already 
                         dead...

               He takes a deep breath.

                                     EVAN
                         But if I can just go back to the 
                         beginning of all this, I still might 
                         be able to save her.

               Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

               TITLE: TWENTY YEARS EARLIER

               ANDREA TREBORN, twenty-five, an attractive pregnant woman 
               strapped to a gurney, is rolled down a busy hospital corridor. 
               She is clearly ready to give birth, and as she flails her 
               arms, she knocks another patient's IV bottle into the wall.

               A birthday party for LENNY, 5, a chubby kid with only a few 
               friends. Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward 
               KAYLEIGH, 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair.

               Evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and 
               kisses his cheek.

               He blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - 1989

               In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky 
               cocker spaniel puppy.

               Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on 
               the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he 
               watches his mother work.

                                     ANDREA
                         Okay, okay... what now?

               Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench 
               from the toolbox.

                                     EVAN
                         We're gonna be late again.

                                     ANDREA
                         When did you ever care about getting 
                         to school on time?

                                     EVAN
                         We're putting up pictures for Parent's 
                         Night.

               Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt.

                                     EVAN
                         Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll 
                         have plenty of time.

               The carburetor will not set properly. She bangs on it with 
               the wrench.

                                     ANDREA
                              (re: carb)
                         Darn it!

                                     EVAN
                         Um... can dad come this time?

                                     ANDREA
                              (getting impatient)
                         You know the answer to that.

                                     EVAN
                         Can't he come out for one day?

                                     ANDREA
                         We've been over this a hundred times. 
                         It's too dangerous for him.

                                     EVAN
                         But Lenny said that his dad's 
                         coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's 
                         dad...

               Andrea hands the wrench to Evan.

                                     ANDREA
                         Here, Ev... Finish this up for me.

               Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb 
               back together.

               Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a 
               spotless nurse's uniform underneath.

                                     EVAN
                         All the dads are gonna be there.

                                     ANDREA
                         I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not 
                         so bad, am I?

                                     EVAN
                         No.

                                     ANDREA
                         Good. Because I've been waiting to 
                         see your art projects all week and 
                         I'd feel terrible if all you thought 
                         about was your father not being there.

               Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea.

                                     EVAN
                              (beat)
                         Done. Try it.

               Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the 
               engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile.

                                     ANDREA
                         You're amazing, kiddo.

               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989

               Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main 
               doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on 
               the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks 
               her watch.

                                     ANDREA
                         Okay have a great day I love you 
                         I'll pick you up later gotta go...

               Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. 
               As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with 
                         you!

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm sorry, but can it wait til 
                         tonight? I'm already late for work --

               Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         I think you really need to see this.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. 
               Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately 
               calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a 
               whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE 
                         ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE!

               Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, 
               but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, 
               sweet-looking girl.

               Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         I was going to show this to the 
                         principal, but I wanted to talk to 
                         you first.

                                     ANDREA
                         What is it?

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         Yesterday I had all the children 
                         draw pictures of what they wanted to 
                         be when they grew up. Most of them 
                         made drawings of what their parents 
                         did, but this...

               Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls 
               out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it.

                                     ANDREA
                         I don't understand... Evan did this?

               The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while 
               standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely 
               sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have 
               been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically 
               correct.

               Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, 
               and struggles to control her concern.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thank you for showing it to me first. 
                         I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I 
                         have the picture?

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         Of course. There is one more thing, 
                         Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for 
                         mentioning it...

                                     ANDREA
                         What?

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         When I asked Evan about his drawing, 
                         well, he didn't remember doing it.

               Andrea is visibly shaken now.

                                     ANDREA
                         I have to go.

               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER

               Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot 
               even start the car.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

               The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's 
               Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made 
               from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture 
               (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and 
               himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each 
               show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is 
               stuck to the far end of page.

               Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear 
               family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused.

                                     LENNY
                         You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. 
                         Boswell has macaroni and glue if you 
                         wanna fix it.  

                                     TOMMY
                         You're such a retard!

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Mommy lives far away but she comes 
                         and visits.

                                     LENNY
                              (to Tommy)
                         If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy 
                         move away from me?

               Tommy gets upset. He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture 
               and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor. Lenny begins 
               to cry.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, what'd you do that for?

                                     TOMMY
                         Fat little baby, crying for mommy.

               Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         Come on, Lenny. It's not that bad. 
                         You can still see your mom a little.

               Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of 
               control. His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.

               Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find 
               her. He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his 
               own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over Lenny's 
               picture. It's a nuclear family again. Lenny slowly is able 
               to catch his breath.

                                     LENNY
                              (grateful)
                         Can... can... Can I have this?

                                     EVAN
                         Sure. I was gonna make a new one, 
                         anyway.

               Kayleigh helps Lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she 
               smiles gratefully at Evan.

               As Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs. Boswell calmly enters 
               the room in time to see Evan tacking up his butchered family 
               portrait. She shivers.

               EXT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY - 1989

               Gothic. Imposing. Andrea runs up the stairs.

               INT. SUNNYVALE - DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               DR. HARLON REDFIELD, 40, a handsome and extremely genial 
               man, scrutinizes a disturbing drawing.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         And you say he doesn't remember any 
                         of it?

                                     ANDREA
                              (anxious)
                         Not according to his teacher. It 
                         just got me thinking about Jason and 
                         what if Evan's inherited his father's 
                         condition?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not 
                         jump to conclusions. I'll run some 
                         preliminary tests, see what we can 
                         rule out.

               Andrea nods and forces a thankful smile.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight 
                         and we'll run a CAT-scan series.

               EXT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - NIGHT

               The looming building looks even more frightening at night. 
               Andrea and Evan head up the stairs.

                                     EVAN
                         I don't like this place, Mom. It's 
                         creepy. Please can we go? I promise 
                         I won't make any more bad pictures!

                                     ANDREA
                              (lighthearted)
                         You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just 
                         wants to give you some tests. You'll 
                         like him.

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - NIGHT

               Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office. Dr. Redfield 
               warmly greets Evan at the door.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet 
                         you.
                              (to Andrea)
                         He's as handsome as his father.

                                     EVAN
                              (stunned)
                         You know my father?

               Before Dr. Redfield can answer, Andrea cuts him off.

                                     ANDREA
                         That's why I wanted you to come here, 
                         Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a 
                         background in memory loss.

                                     EVAN
                         My father has a bad memory, too?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                              (off Andrea's look)
                         Uh, tell you what, Evan. If it's 
                         okay with your mother, I'd like to 
                         run some tests. Nothing scary.

               Evan raises an eyebrow at the doctor.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Okay, it might be a little scary...

               INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

               Evan looks terrified as he lies on a medical platform as a 
               series of CAT-scan images are taken. In another part of the 
               room, a distressed Andrea speaks quietly with Dr. Redfield.

                                     ANDREA
                         Just tell me that Evan doesn't have 
                         Jason's illness...

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test 
                         negative for brain disorders. But 
                         there's something else you can try 
                         to monitor his memory.

                                     ANDREA
                         Anything.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         A journal. Just have him write down 
                         everything he does.

                                     ANDREA
                         Why? What for?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It could be extremely useful to jog 
                         his memory. See if he remembers 
                         anything new the next day. And I'll 
                         have the test results back in a few 
                         days.

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

               The next morning. Evan busily writes in his new black-marble 
               mead comp book:

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I 
               will mete there father and see what a real dad is like. Maybe 
               one day I will mete my Dad."

               Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky 
               Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thanks, George. I really appreciate 
                         you watching him, he won't be any 
                         trouble at all.

               Evan puts down the journal and eats breakfast. He separates 
               the green clovers from the cereal and drops them to the floor 
               for Crockett to nibble.

                                     EVAN
                         These'll bring you luck, Crockett.

                                     ANDREA
                              (into phone)
                         Great. I'll see you soon.

               Andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room.

               INT. HOUSE - DAY

               Andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads 
               back into the kitchen. She drops her purse in shock when she 
               sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large 
               BUTCHER KNIFE by his side.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan?

               Evan sees her but remains expressionless.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan? What are you doing with that 
                         knife?

               Life suddenly springs into Evan's face. He seems stunned to 
               find himself holding the knife and drops it.

                                     EVAN
                              (scared)
                         What happened?

                                     ANDREA
                         Honey. What were you doing with that?

                                     EVAN
                              (tears welling)
                         I... I don't remember.

               EXT. MILLER HOUSE - MORNING

               Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE 
               MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile. 
               He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Hey, Andrea.
                              (to Evan)
                         Hello little man.

               Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets 
               out.

                                     ANDREA
                         Thanks a lot George. Here's my work 
                         number in case there are any problems.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (lighthearted laughter)
                         Whaddaya kidding? We're going to 
                         have a great time today, right Evan?

               Andrea nods thanks and nervously drives away. Evan walks up 
               to Mr. Miller and momentarily reaches for his hand. Mr. Miller 
               flinches his hand away and chuckles at Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         You waiting for an invitation? The 
                         kids are inside.

               Evan appears confused for a moment at Mr. Miller's unexpected 
               rudeness, but walks inside.

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

               Evan enters the well-kept middle class home and sees his 
               classmates Kayleigh and Tommy. Kayleigh is dressed in a make-
               shift Medieval gown and Tommy is also dressed in a period 
               costume.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (excited to see Evan)
                         Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video 
                         camera and we're all gonna be in a 
                         movie.

                                     TOMMY
                         I don't think Evan gets to be in it --

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin 
                         Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and 
                         you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!

                                     TOMMY
                         I thought I was the bad guy!

                         You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.

               Mr. Miller, holding a full glass of scotch in one hand, sets 
               the circa-80's bulky video camera on a tripod and plugs it 
               into the porta-deck.

                                     EVAN
                         We're really gonna be in a movie!?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         That's right, Evan, and you get to 
                         be the star.

                                     TOMMY
                         I thought I was the star.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Shut up, moron. Now get in your 
                         costume, Evan. And you have to 
                         promise, your bestest super-duper 
                         promise, that this will be our little 
                         secret. Think you can do that?

               Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air. Mr. 
               Miller downs his drink and helps Evan off with his clothes. 
               Suddenly --

                                                               HARD CUT TO:

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

               Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place. The rec-room/basement. 
               Evan's eyes dart from the fireplace to Mr. Miller's camera 
               lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles 
               slightly.

               Panic spreads across Evan's face.

                                     EVAN
                         Where am I? What happened? Where did 
                         we all go?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Calm down, kid. Stand still.

               Evan backs up and awkwardly scurries around the basement, 
               grabbing his clothes.

               Panicking.

                                     EVAN
                         I was just somewhere else -- how did 
                         I get here?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Quit acting like some retard or I'll 
                         call your mother and tell her what a 
                         naughty little shit you've been.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh? What happened?

               Kayleigh's eyes are unable to leave the floor. She begins 
               adjusting her disheveled clothing. Evan trembles.

                                     EVAN
                         What's wrong with me?

               Tommy silently watches from the top of the basement stairs, 
               absently wringing the head off one of his sister's dolls.

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY

               Dr. Redfield places Evan's CAT-scan slides on the light box. 
               Andrea squints, unable to interpret them.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Well, the good news is that the 
                         results are negative. I've found no 
                         evidence in the way of lesions, 
                         hemorrhaging, tumors...

                                     ANDREA
                         And the bad news?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Unfortunately, we've got nothing to 
                         work with. It's harder playing 
                         detective now.

                                     ANDREA
                         But you must have something to go 
                         on?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         If I had to guess, I'd say the 
                         blackouts are stress related.

                                     ANDREA
                         But he's seven. What kind of stress 
                         can he have?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got 
                         severe coping problems about not 
                         having a father. Did you say the 
                         last blackout occurred when he was 
                         with his friend's dad.

                                     ANDREA
                         Come on, I doubt the answer's that 
                         simple.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         You'd be surprised how often they 
                         are.

                                     ANDREA
                         Well, he has been pushing me to meet 
                         his father, but I've been putting it 
                         off.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It's worth a shot. I can arrange a 
                         controlled meeting. A careful dose 
                         of sedatives for Jason, some security, 
                         you and I monitoring. Evan comes in 
                         for a quick visit and with any luck, 
                         no more missing father complex.

                                     ANDREA
                         How soon?...

               INT. ANDREA'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Evan, dressed in his Sunday best, writes copiously in a 
               journal marked "AGE 7."

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "April 15. Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason 
               and he is crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad."

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY

               Andrea tightly grips Evan's hand as the pair follow Dr. 
               Redfield down a corridor. Evan's enthusiasm is dampened by 
               the sounds of distant screams and bloodcurdling laughter.

                                     EVAN
                         Dad lives here?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Not in this wing, actually. No.

                                     ANDREA
                         Now your father may seem sleepy to 
                         you, but that's just because of his 
                         medicine, okay?

                                     EVAN
                         Okay.

               They walk to the end of the corridor and come to a "Visitor's 
               Chamber".

               Dr.Redfield leads Evan inside. Andrea begins to follow, but 
               the doctor gestures that she stay outside.

               INT. SUNNYVALE - VISITOR'S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

               Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table. His eyes are 
               fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, 
               a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass.

               JASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room. His eyes 
               want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time. But 
               tranquilizers have dulled the effect.

               Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that 
               hinder Jason's movement. Finally Jason sits.

               He smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones.

                                     JASON
                         It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen 
                         pictures of me, right?

                                     EVAN
                         Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes 
                         and your --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SUNNYVALE - VISITOR'S CHAMBER - DAY

               Evan "comes to" in another unfamiliar place. Rather than 
               seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a 
               ceiling.

               Blocking his view of the ceiling is Jason, whose face is now 
               monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around 
               Evan's throat, choking the life out of him.

                                     JASON
                              (through clenched 
                              teeth)
                         I... love... you.

               Suddenly, ORDERLIES tackle Jason from both sides and wedge a 
               baton under his jaw to wrench him away. Andrea frantically 
               struggles to rescue Evan from Jason's clutches.

                                     JASON
                              (panicking)
                         He has to die! You don't understand! 
                         It's the only way to stop it!

               Jason wrestles the baton from under his chin, hits an orderly 
               in the kneecap and comes for Evan with the baton!

               Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton. As 
               Jason makes another desperate grab for Evan, Orderly #2 is 
               forced to bash him in the skull. Down for the count.

               Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock.

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm sorry, Evan. I'm sorry.

               And ALARM sounds and Andrea tries to cover Evan's eyes, but 
               through her fingers he can see a quick blur of a pool of 
               blood spreading from Jason's head.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - 1989

               Dressed in black, Andrea and Evan watch Jason's casket being 
               lowered into the ground. Andrea's tears soak through her 
               veil. A few feet back, Kayleigh stands behind Evan.

                                     PRIEST
                         Ashes to ashes... dust to dust.

               Evan watches the coffin descend, disappearing from sight. 
               Kayleigh steps up to Evan and takes his hand. A moment. And 
               she softly whispers in Evan's ear.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're better off anyway.

               A rumble of thunder. Evan looks up at the brooding dark 
               clouds.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

               Gray skies. Andrea drives the children home. Evan stares at 
               the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket 
               fence. The flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a 
               white blur is hypnotic.

                                                        SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY - 1995

               Bright and sunny. The lawn freshly cut. A Toro lawnmower has 
               been carelessly left in the grass-strewn driveway.

               TITLE: SIX YEARS LATER

               CRANE DOWN to the window of the --

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT

               Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny are now THIRTEEN. Evan exhales 
               cigarette smoke, taps his ash and finishes sketching a 
               portrait of Kayleigh in his journal.

               Tommy wears a leather jacket and now has traces of peach 
               fuzz on his upper lip.

               Kayleigh's hair is longer now, albeit stringy and unkempt.

               Evan closes his journal and coolly ignites a STRIKE-ANYWHERE 
               MATCH with his thumb and lights Kayleigh's cigarette. Everyone 
               but Lenny smokes in the basement.

               Tommy, now with longer hair, ransacks his father's army locker 
               looking for something.

                                     EVAN
                         Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. 
                         What's up already?

                                     TOMMY
                         Hold your horses, man. It's here 
                         somewhere. I saw it when I was a 
                         kid.

               Tommy absently chucks an old Playboy toward Lenny. Kayleigh 
               seems uncomfortable by the sight of it.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (to Tommy)
                         We should go soon. If Dad catches us 
                         smoking down here, we're dead.

                                     EVAN
                         So let's go. This place creeps me 
                         out.

               Evan claps his hands and stands up, Lenny and Kayleigh join 
               him. Finally, Tommy shakes an old army thermos and hears 
               something rattling inside.

                                     TOMMY
                         I knew it had something to do with 
                         the army.

               Tommy opens the thermos, tips it over and a blockbuster (1/4 
               stick of dynamite) spills out. Tommy grins mischievously.

                                     TOMMY
                         Let's blow the shit out of something!

               EXT. HALPERNS' FOREST - DAY

               Tommy leads Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny on a mission through 
               the woods. Everyone smokes except Lenny, yet he's the only 
               one who's wheezing. He pulls out an inhaler and takes a puff.

                                     LENNY
                         Guys, slow up, would you?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Evan, did I tell you? My mother said 
                         I might be able to visit her this 
                         summer in Orlando with her new family.

                                     TOMMY
                         What did I say about mentioning that 
                         bitch?

                              (uncomfortable)
                         Where the hell are you taking us 
                         anyway? Just blow something up 
                         already.

                                     TOMMY
                         Just blow something up? Are you nuts? 
                         There's an art to mass destruction. 
                         Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? 
                         No. Besides, we're here already.

               Now at the edge of the woods, Tommy spots:

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

               A MAILBOX sits at the end of the driveway. It's exquisite. 
               An exact replica of a Colonial home it serves.

               Across the street, Tommy hands the blockbuster to Lenny.

                                     TOMMY
                         Here you go, buddy.

                                     LENNY
                              (recoiling)
                         What? No frigging way, man. I'm not 
                         touching that thing.

                                     TOMMY
                         The hell you aren't. Anyone of us 
                         does it, you'll puss out and narc 
                         for sure.

                                     LENNY
                         Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. 
                         Look how small that fuse is! I'll 
                         get killed.

                                     EVAN
                         Not necessarily.

               All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks 
               off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end.

                                     EVAN
                         That should buy you ten minutes at 
                         least.

                                     LENNY
                         Gee, thanks friend.

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

               Lenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox, 
               desperately trying to appear nonchalant. He pretends to notice 
               his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it. From the woods, 
               the other kids watch anxiously.

                                     TOMMY
                         Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it, 
                         Lenny.

               Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox. Then sprints 
               like hell to the woods. Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and 
               hands it to him when he gets back.

                                     LENNY
                              (taking puff)
                         Thanks.

               Evan pats Lenny on the back.

                                     EVAN
                         You got balls, man.

               The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation. Evan 
               smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips 
               and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears. She smiles back 
               at him and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches 
               this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to --

               The mailbox. Tick-tock... tick-tock... It's like a staring 
               contest...

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. HALPERNS' FOREST - DAY

               Evan, running full speed, comes to in an unfamiliar place. 
               He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground. Lenny, 
               falling on top of him.

                                     TOMMY
                         Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! 
                         Come on!

                                     EVAN
                              (frantic)
                         What happened?? Where are we?!

               Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being 
               followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying 
               him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles 
               back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through 
               the woods as fast as they can.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (crying)
                         Oh God... what did we do?

                                     EVAN
                         Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! 
                         We've gotta get help!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

               Andrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house. Lenny's 
               mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance.

               As Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs. Kagan gives her 
               an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face. 
               Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop.

                                     ANDREA
                         What is it? What happened?

                                     TOMMY
                              (staring menacingly 
                              at the others)
                         We were just building a fort in the 
                         woods when Lenny freaked out. One 
                         minute he was fine, then he just 
                         froze up. Right guys?

                                     ANDREA
                         What happened, Evan? The truth.

                                     EVAN
                         I don't know... I don't remember.

                                     ANDREA
                         Something must've happened! What set 
                         him off?

                                     EVAN
                         I... I blacked out.

                                     ANDREA
                              (building frustration)
                         Don't try to use your blackouts to 
                         get out of this one!

               Evan looks helpless.

                                     ANDREA
                         You're not making this up, are you?

               Evan shakes his head "no". Almost ashamed...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFCIE - DAY

               Evan lies on a couch.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         With every breath you exhale, you 
                         can feel all of the tension draining 
                         from your body like water through a 
                         faucet. Nine, ten, and you're 
                         completely asleep. Relaxed.

               Evan breathes slowly. Deeply. Andrea watches nervously from 
               the far side of the room.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Now I want you to go back to the 
                         time you were in the woods with Lenny. 
                         Think of it like a movie. You can 
                         pause, rewind, or slow down any 
                         details you wish. Understand?

                                     EVAN
                         Yes.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Where are you now?

                                     EVAN
                         I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my 
                         hands are over her ears.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Are you hurting her?

                                     EVAN
                         No, protecting her.

               Andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Okay. Then go a little forward in 
                         time. What do you see now?

                                     EVAN
                         I see a car.

               Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Yes, tell me about the car.

               Evan moans and begins shaking.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, 
                         this is only a movie. You're 
                         completely safe.

                                     EVAN
                              (moaning)
                         I can't... the car vanishes and all 
                         of a sudden I'm on the ground in the 
                         woods.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         The car doesn't vanish Evan. The 
                         movie in your head has broken, that's 
                         all. But now I've re-spliced it and 
                         I want you to tell me about the car.

                                     EVAN
                         It's coming... argh! I can't!

               Evan moans and shakes on the couch.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Fight it Evan. Hurry. It's coming!

               Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound 
               is uttered from deep within him. Dr. Redfield bolts upright 
               in his chair and redirects the session.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Okay, Evan. Listen to my voice! On 
                         the count of ten, you're going to 
                         wake up. Feeling refreshed and 
                         remembering everything we talked 
                         about.  

               Evan moans in agony. Andrea darts into the room.

                                     ANDREA
                         What's happening to him?? Make it 
                         stop!

               Dr. Redfield waves her away and concentrates on Evan.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         One. You're feeling more awake now. 
                         Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.

               Andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from Evan's nose. She 
               lifts Evan's eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Five. Six. Refreshed and awake! Seven, 
                         eight. Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit!

               Evan is completely non-responsive.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan wake up, oh please wake up!

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open 
                         your eyes, dammit!

               Nothing but moans and blood. Dr. Redfield frantically opens 
               some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts. He breaks a 
               small capsule under evan's mouth, pinches his bleeding nose 
               closed and lets Evan inhale the vapor through his mouth.

               Evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off. Holding his 
               bloody nose.

                                     EVAN
                         What happened? Did it work?

               Evan deduces the answer from everyone's horrified faces.

               EXT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Andrea drops off Evan, Kayleigh and Tommy outside the complex. 
               Kayleigh, looking morose, shuts the car door and Andrea drives 
               off. They walk through the parking lot.

                                     TOMMY
                              (to Kayleigh)
                         Wipe that sad-assed look off your 
                         face before you get us all busted. 
                         You see the way Evan's mom was looking 
                         at you?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EVAN
                         Would someone just tell me already 
                         what the hell happened in the mailbox?

               On "mailbox", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and SHOVES 
               him against a parked car. Tommy looks around to make sure 
               nobody heard anything.

                                     TOMMY
                         Don't ever bring that shit up again. 
                         Not ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh, 
                         or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he 
                         ever learns to talk again. Understand?

               Evan nods, scared. Tommy gives a final shove.

                                     TOMMY
                         Ever.
                              (re: Kayleigh)
                         She don't want to talk about it, 
                         anyway. Do you Kayleigh?

               Tommy's right. Kayleigh clearly doesn't.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER LOBBY - DUSK

               Kayleigh shuffles behind Evan and Tommy as they head toward 
               the theatre. Evan drops back.

                                     EVAN
                         Are you okay?

               Kayleigh says nothing as Tommy sees the theatre playing SEVEN 
               and whispers.

                                     TOMMY
                         There it is. Let's go.

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Andrea does the dishes as the TV plays a NEWSCAST in the 
               b.g.

                                     ANCHOR
                              (on TV)
                         ...was the grizzly aftermath of what 
                         police officials of upstate New York 
                         are calling a horrible act of 
                         vandalism gone awry.

               Andrea turns to the TV, blocking our view. We can only hear 
               the report as she watches intensely.

                                     ANCHOR
                         The powerful explosion is believed 
                         to have been caused by a small 
                         quantity of dynamite.

               Andrea's face looks haunted by the on-screen images. She 
               shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote.

                                     ANCHOR
                         Police thus far have no leads as to 
                         the suspects...

               She clicks off the TV, trembling.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - NIGHT

               The movie's in progress. Evan and Kayleigh sit behind Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! 
                         You'd have to wipe his ass with a 
                         forklift!

               Some crowd members TURN around and give Tommy a SHUSH. Tommy 
               whips M&Ms at them.

                                     TOMMY
                         Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to 
                         you!

               Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs 
               out. Evan follows.

               INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               Evan follows her to a small alcove.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad 
                         idea.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You really don't remember anything 
                         that happened?

               Evan shakes his head "no". She looks devastated.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're so lucky.

               She begins to cry. Evan makes sure no one's staring.

                                     EVAN
                         It's going to be okay. Lenny'll be 
                         fine. You'll see.

               He reaches to comfort her. But she winces.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Ouch.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm sorry.

               She pulls her sleeve up, revealing a large bruise.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called 
                         dad and blamed us for what happened 
                         to Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         Damn. Your dad did this?

               Kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, 
               darker bruise.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (looking down)
                         I deserve a lot worse.

                                     EVAN
                         What are you talking about? What you 
                         deserve is a better brother and 
                         father. All they do is make you feel 
                         like shit.

               She looks into his eyes.

                                     EVAN
                         You really have no clue how beautiful 
                         you are, do you?

               She searches his eyes for sincerity. And finds it. They lean 
               into each other for a TENDER KISS. After a moment, a ROAR 
               from nearby.

                                     TOMMY (O.S.)
                         What the fuck are you doing??

               They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring 
               at them from across a small crowd. By now, some teens chuckle 
               at Tommy.

                                     TEEN PUNK (O.S.)
                         Buying popcorn, what the fuck are 
                         you doing?

               Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. His hands in 
               fists. Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy. Tommy 
               falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him.

               Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Hatred oozing.

               Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what 
               you're thinking.

               Tommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least 
               a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches 
               before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently 
               taking opportunities to eyeball Evan.

               Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly 
               when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY. Tommy valiantly 
               struggles against them at first. But the moment he realizes 
               it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack.

               As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick 
               smile on his face.  Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless.

               INT. ANDREA'S CAR - NIGHT

               Andrea drives through the winding roads.

               CLOSE UP

               Andrea's eyes. Tormented.

               REVEAL she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front 
               and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent.

               Andrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's 
               eyes. Probing. Searching.

                                     ANDREA
                         So how was the movie?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Okay.

               Andrea watches Kayleigh. A calculated beat.

                                     ANDREA
                         Any exploding mailboxes?

               Kayleigh flinches at the question. And Andrea catches it. 
               Evan can't help but look back at Kayleigh. Oh my god, she 
               knows.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (faking poorly)
                         What do you mean?

               Andrea pulls the car over and stops. After a moment, Kayleigh 
               realizes she's at her house. She exits the car in a hurry.

                                     ANDREA
                         Goodnight.

               Andrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead. 
               She finally shifts the car into gear.

                                     ANDREA
                         We're moving.

               Evan says nothing.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               A "For Sale" sign is now planted on the front lawn. Andrea, 
               in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car.

               INT. ANDREA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Evan discreetly watches her leave through the window. Grabs 
               his coat and exits frame.

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house.

                                     EVAN
                         I can't believe Tommy's still pissed 
                         at me. He knows I'm moving away, 
                         right?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         He's been acting real strange lately. 
                         He won't even look me in the eyes 
                         anymore.

                                     EVAN
                         Duck, here they come.

               As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh 
               duck in nearby bushes.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Did your mom say if Lenny was... 
                         okay?

                                     EVAN
                         He must be. They're letting him go, 
                         right?

               The station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Evan puts 
               on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window.

                                     EVAN
                         Welcome home, Lenny!

               Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror. Mrs. Kagan looks 
               angry as she rolls the window down.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                         I think your little homecoming's in 
                         bad taste.

               The smile fades from Evan's face. Kayleigh hangs back.

                                     EVAN
                         Sorry?

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                              (acidic)
                         Lenny's been through a hell of an 
                         ordeal no thanks to you.

               Evan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up 
               and Mrs. Kagan continues into the garage.

               INT. LENNY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Alone, Lenny concentrates on a MODEL AIRPLANE. There is a 
               sudden KNOCK at the window. Lenny's head jerks around to see 
               Evan and Kayleigh smiling through the window.

               EXT. LENNY'S WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

               Evan and Kayleigh stand on the ivy-covered trellis.

                                     EVAN
                              (quietly)
                         Welcome home. Thought you might like 
                         some fresh air for a change.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Hi, Lenny.

               Lenny twitches ever-so-slightly.

                                     LENNY
                         Is Tommy with you guys?

               Evan shakes his head "no".

                                     EVAN
                         It's cool.

               Lenny looks back at the model airplane. Needs to think.

               EXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY

               Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (to Lenny)
                         So what did you do in there?

                                     LENNY
                         It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause 
                         everyone's screaming all night long. 
                         I never want to go back.

               As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column 
               of smoke billowing in the horizon.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Do you see that?

               Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously 
               follows behind.

               They exit the woods to find:

               EXT. JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS

               Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses 
               with lighter fluid.

               Next to a campfire.

                                     EVAN
                         Crockett!!

               Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. 
               Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks 
               up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last 
               minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head.

               Knocking her unconscious.

                                     TOMMY
                         Look what you made me do!

                                     EVAN
                         What's wrong with you?!

               Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's 
               knee cap. BASH! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the 
               ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett 
               squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid.

               Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart 
               from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped 
               in the tied gunny sack.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh! Wake up!

               No response.

                                     TOMMY
                         Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince 
                         Charming!

               Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from 
               the campfire to the fluid soaked dog.

               As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands 
               up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at FULL SPEED --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

               Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place. Still in running mode. 
               His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he 
               is now lying face down on the ground.

               Evan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly 
               bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.

                                     EVAN
                         How long was I out?

               He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same 
               spot. Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh 
               weeping. Evan spins to face her.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where's 
                         Crockett?

               Kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to 
               answer through her tears. Evan struggles to rise but he 
               becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground.

               Evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering 
               then moans and buries his head in his hands.

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               A small neighborhood CROWD has gathered to watch an ambulance 
               with the SUNNYVALE insignia take an entranced Lenny away. 
               Mrs. Kagan is about to climb in the rear when she stops and 
               turns to Evan.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                              (ice cold)
                         Do you know what you are? A monster.

               Evan stands there, speechless.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - DAY

               A packed U-HAUL sits in front of Evan's house. Andrea shifts 
               the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out.

               Outside the truck, Kayleigh waves to Evan, tears spilling 
               shamelessly down her cheeks. Evan reaches behind his seat 
               and opens a large cardboard box. It is filled with past 
               journals. He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and 
               writes something.

               Finished he presses the journal to the window.

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "I'll come back for you."

               Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his 
               own tears as she fades into the distance.

               When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to 
               see what he's written.

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm sorry.

               Evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY - 2002

               TITLE: SEVEN YEARS LATER

               Evan, twenty now, continues writing in a college Blue Book. 
               He is older, dressed down in worn jeans, T-shirt and plaid 
               flannel. He closes the Blue Book with a cocky grin just as 
               PROFESSOR CARTER, 40, calls out to the class:

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Time! Please place your blue books 
                         on my desk before you leave.

               Evan grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets 
               up and turns in his exam.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         How'd you do, Evan?

               Evan flashes a confident smile.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm not sure. I might have gotten 
                         some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov 
                         condition his dogs to lick his nuts?

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                              (laughing)
                         Typical psych major. A complete wise 
                         ass. And how's your project coming? 
                         Still planning to change the way we 
                         humble scientists view memory 
                         assimilation?

                                     EVAN
                              (shrugging)
                         Hey, I got no choice.

               Professor Carter nods solemnly, obviously in the know.

               EXT. COLLEGE - QUAD - DAY

               Evan bikes past students.

               EXT. COLLEGE - FRAT HOUSE - DAY

               Evan bikes past some obnoxious GREEKS.

               EXT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - DAY

               Evan docks his bike and carries his knapsack inside.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - MOMENTS LATER

               Evan's dorm is cluttered "double" whose walls are adorned 
               with head-shop posters of Gothic rock bands.

               By Evan's bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, 
               memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands.

               Evan's roommate, THUMPER, 19, is a completely punked out 
               Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds. He currently hands a black 
               lacy dress to CRICKET, 17, a pierced Goth co-ed. She slips 
               the tattered dress on as Thumper wipes his post-coital self 
               off with a black tee-shirt.

               Evan barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on 
               the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl.

                                     EVAN
                         Whoa. Smells like patchouli and... 
                         ass.

               Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a 
               small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of 
               cornflakes at the other.

                                     THUMPER
                         Cricket, meet my well-mannered 
                         roommate, Evan.

               Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms.

                                     CRICKET
                         Yeah, you're the one who fucked up 
                         the bell-curve on my Anthropology 
                         final. Later, Thumper.

                                     EVAN
                         Nice to meet you, too.

               As she leaves, Thumper takes the black T-shirt by his wallet 
               and throws it on Evan's bed.

                                     THUMPER
                         Here, bro. Found your T-shirt.

               Evan nods thanks, picks up his journal. Reads something and 
               smiles.

                                     EVAN
                         Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking 
                         me out for my birthday.

                                     THUMPER
                         I thought you were a December baby.

                                     EVAN
                         This is bigger. Seven years to the 
                         day. No blackouts.

               Thumper pulls out a bong.

                                     THUMPER
                         Let's do this.

               EXT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - DAY

               INT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - CONTINUOUS

               A popular watering hole. A dark rustic interior, blasting 
               alternative rock.

               Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their 
               tables.

               Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. HEIDI, 
               beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. She sinks the 
               eleven ball off the rail. KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, 
               confident that she and Heidi will hold the table.

                                     KRISTEN
                         So... which one of you has a pet 
                         worm?

               Thumper proudly steps forward.

                                     THUMPER
                         Worms, plural.

                                     KRISTEN
                         That's so gross.

               Thumper steps back, points to Evan.

                                     THUMPER
                         Talk to him about it, he's got the 
                         fetish.

               Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely.

                                     EVAN
                         Actually, they're for a psych project. 
                         A study on memory.

               Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan.

                                     HEIDI
                              (stifling a yawn)
                         Shit, better explain before all the 
                         excitement gives me a heart attack.

               Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket. 
               As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, 
               including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper.

                                     EVAN
                         It's an experiment with flatworms 
                         and a maze. You take a flatworm and 
                         run it through the maze until he's 
                         memorized it. Then you put a new 
                         flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. 
                         Banging into walls, getting lost, 
                         whatever.

                                     THUMPER
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Like Ozzy.

               Gwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumper's head.

                                     SPENCER
                         Ten bucks says he eats it off the 
                         floor.

               Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the 
               three-ball in the side.

                                     EVAN
                         You chop up the smart flatworm and 
                         feed it to the dumb one and presto, 
                         the dumb one suddenly knows the maze 
                         inside and out.

               Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to 
               squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi 
               doesn't mind. He sinks another ball.

                                     EVAN
                         Just by absorbing the first worm 
                         into its cellular structure, it gets 
                         all of the worm's memories.

                                     THUMPER
                              (thoughtfully)
                         That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's 
                         so smart.

               A handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face. They all try to 
               ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers.

                                     HEIDI
                         So what's the point?

                                     EVAN
                              (setting up the eight)
                         Maybe if I can figure out how the 
                         memories of a simple worm function, 
                         it'll help me understand the 
                         complexities of the human brain.

               Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although 
               his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the 
               opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks.

                                     HEIDI
                              (intrigued)
                         So are you planning on becoming a 
                         doctor or something?

               Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan.

                                     EVAN
                         No, I just don't want to lose my 
                         mind.

               As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot... 
               The eight ball.

               CRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing 
               into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table. They're all 
               soaked with beer and debris.

               Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on 
               the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a 
               spear). They sit the fuck down.

               Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's 
               waist. He smiles coolly, it's nothing.

                                     EVAN
                              (to Heidi)
                         I think that's your game.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall 
               on the bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned and Heidi strokes his 
               chest. Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air.

                                     HEIDI
                         Smells like sex in here.

                                     EVAN
                         Thumper had a busy afternoon.

                                     HEIDI
                         You're kidding. He's so... big.

               Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the 
               mini-fridge.

                                     EVAN
                         Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, 
                         I guess. Wanna beer?

               Heidi takes one. Looks under the bed.

                                     HEIDI
                         Most guys tuck their porn under here, 
                         but all you have are... comp books.

                                     EVAN
                         Yeah. I've been keeping journals 
                         since I was seven.

                                     HEIDI
                              (respectfully)
                         Wow... read something.

               Evan chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts 
               his arm around her. Very drunk.

                                     EVAN
                         No way, I'd be too embarrassed.

               Heidi teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso.

                                     HEIDI
                         Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You're 
                         too uptight.

               Evan stops short.

                                     EVAN
                         Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," 
                         and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once 
                         you get a nickname like that you 
                         can't shake it. And I don't want 
                         everyone thinking I've got tapeworms 
                         coming out of my ass or something, 
                         okay?

                                     HEIDI
                              (laughing)
                         Deal. Now read me something.

               Heidi hands him a book marked "AGE 13". He flips it open to 
               a random place and takes the beer from her hand.

                                     EVAN
                              (re: her beer)
                         For courage.

               Evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading. As he 
               reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.

                                     EVAN
                         It's like my mind refused to believe 
                         what it was seeing. Hearing Crockett 
                         make those awful screams... Just 
                         writing about it gives me the shivers.

               Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's 
               reading. He looks over at Heidi, who kisses him.

                                     HEIDI
                         Come on, go on...

                                     EVAN
                         It was like Tommy was possessed or 
                         something. There was a hate in his 
                         eyes that I couldn't really call 
                         human.

               As Evan reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE 
               around him LIKE A TUNING FORK. His voice becomes distant and 
               SOUNDS ECHO around him like distant memories resurrecting 
               themselves...

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY - 1995

               Evan is THIRTEEN again. The scene begins exactly where Evan's 
               blackout occurred as a child. Tommy has just knocked Kayleigh 
               unconscious with a wooden plank, Lenny is frozen at the sight 
               of Crockett in the fluid-soaked gunny sack. And Evan, seething 
               with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy 
               at full speed.

               Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.

                                     EVAN
                         What the hell is going on?

               Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and 
               swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling 
               backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.

               Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan 
               writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves 
               toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the 
               rope that traps Crockett inside.

                                     LENNY
                         I can't undo the rope!

               Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.

                                     TOMMY
                         Drop it or I'll slit your mother's 
                         throat in her sleep.

               As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told. His eyes begin 
               to glaze over.

               Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of 
               strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on.

                                     EVAN
                         I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!

               Lenny remains frozen in place. Tommy yanks his leg back, 
               breaking Evan's grip.

               Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap.

               Tommy's voice hitches. His eyes water from pent up 
               frustration.

                                     TOMMY
                         Listen to me good, Evan. There's a 
                         million other sisters in the world. 
                         You didn't have to fuck with mine.

               Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy 
               pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the 
               campfire to the soaked gunny sack.

               WHOOSH OF FLAMES

               And Evan passes out.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002

               Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh my God! No! No!

               Heidi rolls her eyes.

                                     HEIDI
                         Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream.

               She stands and angrily puts on her jacket.

                                     EVAN
                              (freaked out)
                         It didn't feel like a dream.

                                     HEIDI
                         Maybe because they never do.
                              (sarcastic)
                         So Don Juan, you pass out on all 
                         your dates?

               Evan doesn't even hear her. After getting his bearings, he 
               grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded.

               INT. EVAN'S CAR - SUNRISE

               Evan drives...

               EXT. LENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Very 
               little has changed in the past seven years.

               INT. LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               ANGLE ON LENNY

               Now 20, making a model airplane. He's still overweight and 
               looks like his mother dresses him.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               The room is filled with model airplanes. Hundreds of them.

               A KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, 
               opens the door and escorts Evan inside. She glares at Evan 
               while pretending to be cheerful.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                         I've got a surprise for you, Lenny. 
                         You'll never guess who's here.

               Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops.

               ANGLE ON EVAN

               Looking around, shocked to see:

               PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM.

               Nothing has changed in the past seven years. 

               The same kids' toys, posters and comic books.

               AS WE PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO LENNY

               We see he's working on the model again, in his own world. 
               The window of opportunity for conversation has closed.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, uh, it's me. Evan.

               Silence. Lenny frowns.

                                     EVAN
                         What's that you're working on? A 
                         model?

               Nothing.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, you look busy, so maybe I should 
                         make this quick. I'd totally 
                         understand if you didn't want to get 
                         into this right now, but that day at 
                         the junkyard, could you help me 
                         remember what happened? Any details?

               No response. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk.

                                     LENNY
                         I couldn't cut the rope.

                                     EVAN
                              (containing excitement)
                         Yeah, good, what else do you remember?

                                     LENNY
                         Drop it or I'll slit your mother's 
                         throat in her sleep.

               Evan, startled, drops the model on the desk. An epiphany.

                                     EVAN
                         Jesus Christ. It really happened.

               Lenny stares out the window.

                                     EVAN
                         What if I can get back all my lost 
                         memories with my journals.

               With lightning speed, Lenny jumps from his desk and 
               unexpectedly shoves EVAN IN TO THE WALL. Squadrons of hanging 
               planes crash to the floor. Lenny digs his fingers into Evan's 
               shoulder.

                                     LENNY
                         Make one peep and I swear it'll be 
                         your last, motherfucker.

               Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins 
               working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. 
               Evan is speechless.

               The door bursts open. Mrs. Kagan looks at the smashed model 
               airplanes by Evan's feet. Evan ignores her accusing stare.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I 
                         shouldn't have waited so long.

               When Lenny doesn't respond, Mrs. Kagan hustles Evan back 
               into the hallway.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins 
               pouring over them.

               Nearby, Thumper empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk.

                                     THUMPER
                         You really think he wanted to kill 
                         you?

                                     EVAN
                         All I know is that I might be able 
                         to unblock some of my repressed 
                         memories.

               He finds something he's looking for, marks the page with a 
               yellow post-it note marked, BLACKOUT and sets the book in a 
               separate pile.

               As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically 
               opens up to a place where the spine was bent. Staring up at 
               him is the message:

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "I will come back for you."

               Evan looks overcome by guilt.

               Later that evening:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan has now organized a pile of five journals. He selects 
               an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal. 
               Fear covers his face. He holds one of his hands up and isn't 
               surprised to see it trembling.

               He opens his journal again and reads out loud.

                                     EVAN
                              (reading aloud)
                         The last thing I remember before the 
                         blackout was holding my hands over 
                         Kayleigh's ears...
                              (his voice slowly 
                              fades)
                         I think I was more focused on her 
                         hands on mine than the mailbox across 
                         the street...

               His own words grow reverberant, distant. Furthermore, the 
               walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOME - DAY - 1995

               Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the 
               mailbox across the street with intense anticipation.

               When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently 
               drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt, 
               SMOLDERING.

               The mailbox... tick-tock, tick-tock... Like a staring contest.

                                     LENNY
                         Maybe it went out. Should someone 
                         check it?

                                     TOMMY
                         Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

               Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls 
               into the driveway.

               MRS. HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of 
               the car and walks to the mailbox.

               Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of 
               Lenny's shoulder.

                                     TOMMY
                         Make one peep and I swear it'll be 
                         your last, motherfucker.

               Tommy's words make Evan flinch. From inside the car, a BABY 
               begins to cry. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car.

               Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in 
               pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the 
               lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing 
               a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.

                                     MRS. HALPERN
                         How's my sweet girl? Awww, you need 
                         a change, don't you honey?

               Mrs. Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house. As 
               the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids 
               break into wide smiles of relief. But wait...

               The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to 
               the mailbox. Now Tommy is the only one left still smiling.

                                     MRS. HALPERN
                         You want to open the door, honey?

               The baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment --

               ANGLE ON KIDS' FACES

               BOOM!!!

               The blast is deafening. Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the 
               results in stunned horror.

                                     TOMMY
                         C'mon! Run!!

               Evan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run 
               a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them.

                                     TOMMY
                         Lenny? Come on!

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh my God oh my God...

               Lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson 
               road. Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to 
               make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply 
               against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin 
               to run with Lenny through the woods.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan comes to. Lurches his body over the bed and vomits.

               Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick 
               and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the 
               cigarette burn.

                                     EVAN
                         What the hell?

               In the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops 
               up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist.

                                     THUMPER
                         Christ, man. You wanna clean that up 
                         before I lose my appetite here?

               Evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins 
               of the journal.

               INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

               The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, 
               posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND.

               Carefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward 
               the bustling elevators. Evan leans against the side of a pay 
               phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise.

                                     EVAN
                         Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is 
                         Evan Treborn.
                              (rolling eyes)
                         I know. I'm sorry about that. But I 
                         really need to speak with him.

               She's obviously hung up on him. Suddenly, a HAND grabs his 
               shoulder. It's PROFESSOR CARTER.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. 
                         Just wanted to know how the flatworms 
                         project was coming.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of 
                         crazy lately with my mom coming up, 
                         so I haven't...

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         I know, I know. Who can think of 
                         worms when your libido's in full 
                         swing, right?

               Evan shrugs and forces a smile.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Just don't drop the ball, okay?

                                     EVAN
                         I won't let you down, Professor 
                         Carter.

               Carter waves to another student and her parents and walks 
               away.

               INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A waiter clears the dishes away from Evan and Andrea's table.

               REVEAL ANDREA

               Her hair now has gray streaks. As she signs for the bill, 
               she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek.

                                     EVAN
                         Please, mom. People will talk.

                                     ANDREA
                         I can't help it. I'm just so proud 
                         of you. You've got the highest grades 
                         in all of your classes.

                                     EVAN
                         Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?

                                     ANDREA
                              (smiling)
                         Please. He got straight A's without 
                         ever touching a book. That was the 
                         one area where his memory never failed 
                         him.

                                     EVAN
                         Ma? Did he ever say that he figured 
                         out a way to recall a lost memory 
                         years after he blacked it out for 
                         the first time?

               Andrea's smile fades.

                                     ANDREA
                         Why do you ask?

                                     EVAN
                         No, it's just weird with him being 
                         such a brain and all, I just wondered 
                         if he was ever able to remember stuff 
                         he'd forgotten.

                                     ANDREA
                         When he was around your age... almost 
                         exactly your age. He said he figured 
                         out a trick to remember the past.

               Evan tries not to react.

                                     ANDREA
                         I couldn't tell if they were real 
                         memories or just phantoms. You know, 
                         he might only have thought he actually 
                         remembered them...

                                     EVAN
                         Sure...

                                     ANDREA
                         And then, just before it got so bad 
                         that he had to be committed, he said 
                         that he could...

                                     EVAN
                         What? What could he do?

               Andrea shakes her head.

                                     ANDREA
                         Forget it. It's nothing. He was far 
                         too sick by then.

               Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room 
               looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly 
               watches Evan with growing concern.

                                     EVAN
                              (reading aloud)
                         I never wanted to be in the movie 
                         anyway and it was cold so I wanted 
                         to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller 
                         took his shirt off --

                                     THUMPER
                         What the fuck are you doing?

                                     EVAN
                         Shhh! I need quiet for this.

               Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.

                                     THUMPER
                         Are you stupid or what?

                                     EVAN
                         What?

                                     THUMPER
                         Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a 
                         reason why you've repressed the one 
                         day when some old lecher had you in 
                         your tighty whities, dammit!

               Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. A bitter laugh.

                                     THUMPER
                         Yeah, man. I'd think twice about 
                         this. You could wake up a lot more 
                         fucked up than you are now.

               He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins 
               reading it silently.

               His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in 
               defeat.

               INT. EVAN'S CAR - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Evan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from 
               his eyes and punches the accelerator. His teeth are clenched 
               and he hammers his fist on the dashboard.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EVENING

               Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. He eyes a 
               piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.

               INT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - CONTINUOUS

               A run-down greasy spoon. Filled with a number of TOWNIES and 
               TRUCKERS. The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears 
               decorated in grime motif.

               Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of 
               the kitchen with a tray full of food.

               Kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin. She bangs 
               her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to 
               the floor. Her BOSS stares back in aggravation.

                                     BOSS
                         Can we get through one goddamned day 
                         without you breaking something?

               Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up 
               the order. She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a 
               pay phone so that she can't see him watching her.

               As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches 
               her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. 
               She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the 
               customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably.

               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - NIGHT

               Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she 
               exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, 
               but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her 
               face and she allows herself to be hugged.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         God, Evan! I never thought I'd see 
                         you again. How've you been?

                                     EVAN
                         Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a 
                         long time. Fill me in.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm going to State now. Things are 
                         going okay. I guess. Mom's good...

               Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches 
               into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.

                                     EVAN
                              (declining)
                         Not since we were kids.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I've stopped a hundred times.

                                     EVAN
                         So how's Tommy?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (takes a long drag)
                         They kept him in juvy for a few years. 
                         Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.

               Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question.

                                     EVAN
                         You still live with your dad?

               Her face is betrayed by a slight tick.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         No. I emancipated myself when I was 
                         fifteen.

                                     EVAN
                         Wow. That must've taken some courage.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Not if you remember my dad.

                                     EVAN
                         Couldn't you have moved in with your 
                         mom?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (shaking her head)
                         She had a new family. Not enough 
                         space for me. Said I should have 
                         moved in with her when we were kids. 
                         But... whatever.

               They walk in silence for a moment.

                                     EVAN
                         Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I 
                         came back to town was to talk to 
                         you.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (brightening)
                         Me? Are you kidding? Why?

                                     EVAN
                         Remember when I was a kid I had all 
                         these blackouts?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Of course.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, lately some of the memories 
                         have begun to come back and I'd kinda 
                         like to talk to you about one of 
                         them in particular. It'd be a big 
                         help.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, sure. I'll try to remember. 
                         Shoot.

                                     EVAN
                         When we were kids. Your dad was making 
                         a movie. Robin Hood or something?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (cold)
                         What do you want to know, Evan?

                                     EVAN
                         It's just... did he... what happened 
                         in the basement?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It was a long time ago.

                                     EVAN
                         I know, but...

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (cold)
                         Is that why you came all the way 
                         back? To ask a lot of stupid questions 
                         about Robin Hood?

                                     EVAN
                         No, but I think something really bad 
                         might've happened to us.

               Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Is there a point to any of this?

               Evan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness. He 
               steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face. She 
               flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.

                                     EVAN
                         Whatever happened, it wasn't our 
                         fault. You know we couldn't have 
                         stopped it.

               Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow.

                                     EVAN
                         Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like 
                         bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't 
                         spoken to you in seven years...

               She moves her face away from his hand.

                                     EVAN
                         But you were seven years old and 
                         there's nothing you could've done to 
                         deserve...

               Her face collapses and she turns away.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (defeated)
                         Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting 
                         your breath.

                                     EVAN
                         You can't hate yourself just because 
                         your dad's a twisted freak.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! 
                         You come all the way out here to 
                         stir up my shit just because you had 
                         a bad memory!? You want me to cry on 
                         your shoulder and tell you that 
                         everything's all better now? Well 
                         fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be 
                         all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets 
                         better!

               Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         If I was so wonderful, Evan, why 
                         didn't you ever call me? Why'd you 
                         leave me here to rot?!

               She turns and runs away. Evan looks sick with guilt.

               EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY - 2002

               A few GREEKS play frisbee and talk trash. Evan, tired and 
               depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn 
               scar on his belly. Contemplating...

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's 
               bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. He chokes out a 
               message.

                                     THUMPER
                         Some dude left a message for you.

               Evan puts a towel under the door.

                                     EVAN
                         You can smell it all the way in the 
                         bathroom.

               Evan hits "play" on the answering machine.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (male voice)
                         Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter. 
                         Just wondered why you didn't hand in 
                         your essay this afternoon. I was a 
                         bit concerned. Call me to schedule a 
                         make-up.

               BEEP. Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (male voice)
                         What did you say to my sister 
                         motherfucker?! Last night she cried 
                         on the phone for over an hour to me.
                              (enraged breathing)
                         She said you came and saw her last 
                         night.

               Thumper coughs accidentally, tips the bong over on Evan's 
               bed. Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door 
               and wipes off Evan's comforter.

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (Tommy; cont'd)
                         She... she fucking killed herself 
                         tonight. She's dead.
                              (beat)
                         And so are you.

               BEEP. Evan stares dumbstruck at the machine.

                                     THUMPER
                         Whoa, bad news, bro. I don't think 
                         this is gonna come out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of 
               the cemetery. A small cluster of friends and family gather 
               at the grave. Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking 
               to the grave. When he suddenly spots Mr. Miller and Tommy.  
               Evan's hands tense up into fists. He becomes weak in the 
               knees and stops walking. After an uncomfortable moment of 
               standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the 
               ceremony from the driver's seat.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The last of the mourners are filing away. Evan exits his car 
               and walks to the deserted grave. He drops the roses on the 
               casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching.

               Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper. 
               He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite:

               EVAN'S DIARY

               "I'll come back for you."

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               He makes a weighty decision and gets up. He hastily hunts 
               through his journals, looking for a certain book.

               Evan opens his journal marked "Age 7". He plops on his bed 
               and starts writing sideways in the margins.

                                     EVAN (V.O.)
                         It's been said that a person's life 
                         is little more than the sum of his 
                         experiences. If that's true, then 
                         I'm not sure I know who I am anymore.
                              (beat)
                         I definitely never knew Kayleigh.

               He turns the page and begins reading the journal. As he mouths 
               the entry to himself, the resonance of an older man's voice 
               seems to REVERBERATE throughout the room and the WORLD behind 
               his head FAINTLY VIBRATES.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. MILLER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1989

               Mr. Miller plays with his camera and the kids are excited 
               about playing Robin Hood in a movie.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Shut up moron. Now get in your costume 
                         Evan.

               Evan slowly nods and begins to strip out of his clothes. Mr. 
               Miller takes a quick peek at him.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         I've got an idea. Let's go downstairs, 
                         it'll look more like a dungeon down 
                         there.

               INT. MILLER'S BASEMENT - DAY - 1989

               Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. 
               Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the 
               camera. Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, 
               looking down.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (to Tommy)
                         What did I say about keeping that 
                         door closed, stupid?

                                     TOMMY
                         But I wanna see!

                                     MR. MILLER
                         You're gonna see my fist in about 
                         two seconds unless you do what I 
                         tell you.

               Tommy sulks and closes the door. Mr. Miller lowers his voice 
               and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Now in this part of the story, Robin 
                         Hood just married Maid Marian and 
                         they have to kiss and stuff like 
                         grown-ups do.

               Kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand. Evan 
               looks skeptical.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         So take your clothes off Kayleigh.

               Kayleigh stops giggling. Evan says nothing.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Come on, like when you take a bath. 
                         Don't make a deal out of it. You 
                         too, Evan.

               Mr. Miller gets behind the lens. The room is dead silent.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Let's go.

               ANGLE ON TOMMY

               Who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs 
               and watches with horror.

               Evan's face is flushed with rage. He walks behind Kayleigh 
               and cups his hands tightly around her ears. She can't hear 
               anything now.

                                     EVAN
                         What time is it?

                                     MR. MILLER
                         It's time for you to stand where the 
                         hell I told you.

                                     EVAN
                         Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the 
                         very moment of your reckoning. In 
                         the next thirty seconds you're going 
                         to open one of two doors. The first 
                         door will forever traumatize your 
                         own flesh and blood.

               The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a 
               seven-year old. Mr. Miller looks around the room as if he's 
               the butt of some sick joke.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (stunned disbelief)
                         What's happened to -- How are you 
                         doing that?

                                     EVAN
                              (voice rising)
                         It'll change your daughter from a 
                         beautiful child into an empty shell 
                         whose only concept of trust was 
                         betrayed by her own sick pedophile 
                         father. Ultimately, it'll lead to 
                         her suicide. Nice work, daddy.

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (hoarse whisper)
                         Who -- who are you?

               Evan impatiently waves the question.

                                     EVAN
                         Let's just say you're being closely 
                         watched, George. Your other option 
                         is to get your porn off the rack and 
                         treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say 
                         like how a loving father treats his 
                         daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?

                                     MR. MILLER
                              (choking)
                         ...yes.

                                     EVAN
                         Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw 
                         up again and I swear I'll flat out 
                         castrate you.

               The impact of the last sentence isn't lost on Mr. Miller.

                                     EVAN
                         One last thing.

               Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh stares 
               at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers.

               Kayleigh looks into Evan's eyes for support. Evan nods go 
               on. His confidence brings a boldness to her lips.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Don't you ever touch me again.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         I -- I won't.

               Kayleigh summons her own new courage.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I'm cold. And I'm putting on my 
                         clothes.

               As he leaves to pick up her clothes, Evan grins.

                                     EVAN
                         What you need to do is discipline 
                         your son Tommy, because the kid's 
                         one sadistic pup.

               Hiding at the top of the basement stairs, Tommy recoils in 
               horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins 
               twisting the head back and forth...

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - MORNING - 2002

               A broad smile lines Evan's face as he slowly wakes up from 
               his slumber. He suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from 
               a pounding migraine.

               MONTAGE OF SWIRLING MEMORIES

               Quick cuts and flashes of Evan and Kayleigh growing older -- 
               she seems more carefree now, full of life and less self- 
               conscious.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - DAY - 1989

               Evan pulls Kayleigh around in a little red wagon.

               INT. FAMILY RESTAURANT - DAY - 1989

               Evan and Kayleigh play in a tub of balls in the playroom.

               EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY - 1989

               Kayleigh pushes Evan on a tire swing.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER - NIGHT - 1995

               Tommy, glaring at Evan, thrashes the Teen Punk.

               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY - 1995

               Burning sack in flames.

               EXT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - STREET - 1995

               QUICK FLASH of the U-Haul driving away.

               EXT. BUS STATION - DAY - 1995

               At thirteen, Kayleigh spunkily hops off a GREYHOUND BUS and 
               runs into Evan's arms.

               EXT. ANDREA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY - 1995

               Still thirteen, Evan peddles his bike by his new house, 
               Kayleigh riding on the handlebars.

               More memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen 
               years, they grow up as lovers now:

               EXT. LAKE - DAY - 1997

               Evan and Kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - SUNRISE - 2002

               Evan and Kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - MORNING - 2002

               Finally the memory assault is over. Evan groans in pain as 
               blood trickles from his nose.

               An arm reaches over and touches his shoulder.

                                     KAYLEIGH (O.S.)
                         Honey, are you all right?

               Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him. Not only is 
               Kayleigh alive, but she's a ravishing beauty. Evan lurches 
               back from the shock of seeing Kayleigh and falls to the floor. 
               She sees Evan's nose bleed and her eyes go wide.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh my God, Evan. You're bleeding! 
                         Look at you!

               Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.

                                     EVAN
                              (transfixed by her)
                         Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...
                              (looks around)
                         Incredible.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (purring)
                         Mmmm... You give good compliment. 
                         Clean up and come back to bed.

               He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority 
               plaques and pink preppy decor.

               Evan, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him 
               a tissue. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed 
               and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and 
               brown suede jacket.

                                     EVAN
                         Where... where are my clothes?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Those are your clothes, silly.

               Evan frowns with distaste, grabs a towel and heads out.

               WE FOLLOW HIM INTO:

               INT. SORORITY BATHROOM - MORNING

               At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at 
               his reflection in the mirror. A nearby shower SHUTS OFF.

                                     EVAN
                         This is too amazing! Un-fucking-real!

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I wish I could get so excited about 
                         a nose bleed.

               Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats 
               from the bar, exit the shower naked.

                                     EVAN
                         Whoops. Sorry. My bad.

               Evan blushes and turns back to the mirror through which Gwen 
               dries herself with a towel while staring flirtatiously back 
               at Evan.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, you were with those assholes 
                         who threw popcorn at Thumper.

               Evan holds his temple in pain as another memory comes to 
               him.

                                     EVAN
                         And your name is... Gwen!

                                     GWEN
                         Seriously, Evan. Lay off the blow.

               She pats his ass and exits the bathroom.

               EXT. COLLEGE - QUAD - DAY - 2002

               Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches 
               the eye of every guy on campus. She and Evan stroll arm in 
               arm through the quad.

               Somehow, the world seems brighter now. Even the colors seem 
               more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world 
               we've known.

               MANY STUDENTS wave to Evan and call his name. He can't 
               remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the BMOC.

               Evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me 
                         over this, but do you remember when 
                         your dad first got his video camera? 

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well I remember he had one... but 
                         he, like, put it away after the first 
                         day. Why would that freak me out?

                                     EVAN
                         I dunno.
                              (goofy smile)
                         Just being weird.

               Kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the 
               ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Such a goofus. See you tonight.

               Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away. 
               After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself.

               INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY

               Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and 
               dials a telephone number.

                                     EVAN
                              (to himself)
                         Come on, Mom, be there!

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE
                              (Andrea's voice)
                         Andrea,
                              (Evan's voice)
                         Evan,
                              (a strange, older 
                              man's voice)
                         And Chuck,
                              (all three)
                         Aren't home right now. You know what 
                         to do.

                                     EVAN
                              (off-guard)
                         Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck. Just calling 
                         to say hi and well, call me.

               Evan hangs up the phone, then checks his watch. No, wrist. 
               At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby.

                                     EVAN
                         Thumper! What time is it, man?

               Thumper eyes this strange preppy kid with distaste.

                                     THUMPER
                         Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?

                                     EVAN
                         Huh?

                                     THUMPER
                         Fuck off, frat boy.

               Thumper walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded.

               INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

               Evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other 
               STUDENTS who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor 
               Carter's desk.

               Evan hears PEOPLE he cannot see calling his name. Somehow, 
               it's more creepy than cool. The Professor makes a loud 
               announcement.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         Remember, everyone! Only two weeks 
                         until your science projects are due.

                                     EVAN
                              (quietly)
                         I still owe you an essay from last 
                         week. Is there any way I could get 
                         an extension?

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         And you are...?

                                     EVAN
                              (disappointed)
                         Evan Treborn.

                                     PROFESSOR CARTER
                         The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now 
                         take a seat. The exam's about to 
                         begin.

               Evan walks up the aisle and takes a seat. As he sits down, 
               someone puts his ARM menacingly around Evan's throat.

               Evan flinches, turns around and sees Hunter, the frat guy 
               Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar.

                                     EVAN
                         Leave me alone, asshole. I didn't 
                         lay a hand on you, okay?

               Hunter bursts out laughing.

                                     HUNTER
                         Evan, you're hysterical. You study 
                         for this?

                                     EVAN
                              (awkward)
                         We'll find out soon enough.

                                     HUNTER
                              (laughing)
                         Me neither.

               Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam. 
               Evan's face brightens.

                                     EVAN
                         You're kidding. Are these the 
                         answers?!

                                     HUNTER
                         Damn, Evan, on the D.L.

                                     EVAN
                              (holding it lower)
                         Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do 
                         something really special for Kayleigh 
                         tomorrow. If I said I needed some 
                         help from you and the brothers...

                                     HUNTER
                         I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to 
                         do it.

               Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row.

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex. She seems 
               incredibly satisfied, but he looks slightly uncomfortable.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh my God, that was good. Where'd 
                         you learn all those new tricks?

                                     EVAN
                         So it didn't feel... weird?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms 
                         weird.

               She giggles and snuggles into him. He's grateful for her 
               affection, but still looks uneasy. The PHONE RINGS and he 
               automatically answers it.

                                     EVAN
                         Yellow.

               Silence on the other end. More silence.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Fuck 'em.

               As Evan hangs up, he and Kayleigh share a giggle and he 
               resumes snuggle position.

                                     EVAN
                         What do you think it is about us 
                         that makes us so perfect? Like, 
                         looking back, whatever gave you the 
                         nerve to sneak out and visit me after 
                         I moved away?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (laughs)
                         As if my dad could've stopped me 
                         from seeing you. What's he gonna do 
                         to me?

               Evan smiles to himself. And hugs her tighter.

                                     EVAN
                         You think we'll always be together?

               For the first time she looks at him with concern.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         That is the plan, right? Hell or 
                         high water?

               He's in heaven, but plays it cool.

                                     EVAN
                         Just making sure.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAY

               The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their 
               clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit.

               Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon 
               on a metal salad bowl that a poor THETA CHI PLEDGE wears as 
               a hat.

                                     EVAN
                         Order, order. So all you rushes know 
                         what you've got to do for me?

                                     THETA CHI PLEDGE
                              (correcting him)
                         Pledges, Sir Brother Evan, Sir.

                                     EVAN
                         Pledges, rushees, same difference. 
                         Now this is a one-time deal. You do 
                         all this for me and I'll never give 
                         you shit again. Promise.

               A buzz of excitement runs through the pledges.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FRAT HOUSE - ATTIC HALL - NIGHT

               It's peaceful now. Evan covers Kayleigh's eyes with his hands 
               as he leads her through the attic hallways. Both are dressed 
               to the nines.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I don't understand, where are you 
                         taking me?

                                     EVAN
                         You'll see.

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

               The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh 
               and Evan. Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees:

               The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese 
               lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. And elegant 
               romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY 
               DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully 
               stare ahead with the utmost class.

               Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by. 
               Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I don't know what to say. It's 
                         beautiful.

                                     EVAN
                         Go on. Sit down.

               As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower 
               down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing 
               on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.

               Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Why are you doing all this for me?

                                     EVAN
                         Simple math. When I woke up this 
                         morning and saw your smile... I knew 
                         that I wanted to spend the rest of 
                         my life with you.

               Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. Her eyes 
               tell him she feels the same way. A magical moment.

               And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it 
               might as well be their first ever --

               Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.

                                     HUNTER
                         We been lookin' all over for you, 
                         man.

                                     SENIOR BROTHER
                         Someone trashed your car.

               The moment's gone. Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks.

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

               Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked 
               at the bottom of the hill. His face collapses.

               Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. 
               The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been 
               mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the 
               roof.

               The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG 
               COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.

               By now a crowd has gathered. Evan runs up to people.

                                     EVAN
                              (panicked)
                         Did you see who did this? You see 
                         anyone?

               No one will answer with anything more than a shrug.

                                     HUNTER
                         Probably them Pika fuckers.

               But Kayleigh knows better. She stares at the collar.

                                     EVAN
                         How could he get away with this? 
                         Right in front of the goddamn frat 
                         house!

               A SENIOR BROTHER angrily calls him from the lawn.

                                     SENIOR BROTHER
                         Frat house? Hey man, would you call 
                         your "country" a "cunt"?

               Kayleigh shudders and Evan puts his arms around her.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Don't. He's probably watching.

               INT. FRAT HOUSE - EVAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. 
               Evan can't help but look under the bed. No one. He then locks 
               the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of 
               Pepper Spray.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's my fault. I should have told 
                         you he was released a few weeks ago.

                                     EVAN
                         Might'a been nice.
                              (re: pepper spray)
                         Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe 
                         one of the frat guys has a gun.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He 
                         wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying 
                         to scare you away from me.

                                     EVAN
                              (shaking the cannister)
                         Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (quietly)
                         It's not his fault, Evan. You knew 
                         how bad he had it when we were kids.

                                     EVAN
                         Don't give me this Oprah-book club 
                         bad upbringing shit, because you 
                         turned out fine.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (quietly)
                         My father never laid a hand on me. 
                         It's like the prick saved it all up 
                         for Tommy.

               Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. 
               Kayleigh's eyes plead for him to have compassion.

                                     EVAN
                         Fine, then. We'll let campus security 
                         deal with him.

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - NIGHT

               Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. 
               Evan seems especially paranoid. In the distance, some guy 
               vomits loudly.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Are you okay?

                                     EVAN
                         What do you mean?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's just... you've been acting kinda 
                         strange, you know?

                                     EVAN
                         Like how?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I don't know. You seem... different. 
                         You make weird jokes. Your accents 
                         changed. You don't even walk the 
                         same.

                                     EVAN
                         I walk differently?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I can't put my finger on it, but 
                         everything's a bit off. Even the 
                         dinner tonight. It was beautiful, 
                         but...

                                     EVAN
                         I know I've been actin strange lately. 
                         It's just that... I don't want 
                         anything to happen to us.

               The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes. Kayleigh 
               and Evan instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly, Kayleigh's 
               ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Wait. Something's not right. Isn't 
                         that your jacket?

                                     EVAN
                         What?

               The guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs 
               to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Tommy.

               Tommy has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy 
               hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE THUMPER (a short, 
               steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand.

               Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat 
               pockets.

                                     EVAN
                         Leave us alone you sick fuck!

                                     TOMMY
                         Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna 
                         lay a hand on my own sister. You've 
                         done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice 
                         friends, nice life, not to mention 
                         you're fucking my sister. Not a bad 
                         piece of ass if I say so myself.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Shut up, Tommy!

                                     TOMMY
                         Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.

               Tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper.

                                     EVAN
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     TOMMY
                         It wasn't enough that the whole world 
                         loves you, but you had to take away 
                         the last person on earth who didn't 
                         think I was a piece of shit.

                                     EVAN
                              (suppressing panic)
                         No one thinks you're a piece of shit, 
                         Tommy.

                                     TOMMY
                         Right, Evan. I believe you just said 
                         "sick fuck."

               Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in 
               the shoulder and ribs.

               Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, 
               Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.

               Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free 
               hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, 
               keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. 
               Kayleigh screams. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly 
               swinging the tire thumper. Evan charges forward in an 
               uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands 
               and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open 
               mouth.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!

                                     EVAN
                         He's a fucking maniac!

               Evan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper. Kayleigh screams 
               and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of 
               her. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.

                                     EVAN
                         He ruined Lenny's life --

               Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Kayleigh pushes a button 
               on the "Blue Light" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS.

                                     EVAN
                         He killed Crockett --
                              (kicks him)
                         Murdered that woman and her baby!
                              (kicks again)
                         And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh! 
                         He's trying to fucking kill me!

               Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings 
               down OFF CAMERA.

               CRUNCH!

               Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. 
               Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. And stops 
               cold when she sees the damage to Tommy.

               Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still 
               terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a 
               crablike fashion.

               SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's 
               limp body.

               Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of 
               the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along 
               with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints.

               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters 
               the General Population area of the prison. PRISONERS begin 
               screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of 
               new inmates. Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward 
               his cell. Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over 
               the second tier, KARL, a huge muscular con with tattoos of 
               swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at 
               Evan and winks.

               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY

               Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus 
               Christ and various Saints. Burning flames on open cans of 
               shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine.

               There is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk. Sitting on 
               the bottom bunk is CARLOS, 30s, a massive Hispanic convict 
               covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony.

               Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his 
               bed on the top bunk.

                                     CARLOS
                         First time?

               Evan nods glumly.

                                     CARLOS
                         Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's 
                         luggage that way.

                                     EVAN
                              (desperate)
                         Can you protect me?

                                     CARLOS
                         Jesus himself couldn't make me take 
                         on the Brotherhood. When they come, 
                         just put your mind in another place, 
                         man. Be somewhere else.

               A BUZZER SOUNDS. Carlos leaves the cell without another word.

               INT. PRISON CAFETERIA - EVENING

               Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and 
               some other INMATES. No sooner has he sat down to eat, do 
               eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food. Carlos 
               shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll.

               INT. MAVIS VISITING CHAMBER - DAY

               Andrea sits across from Evan in the visitor's chamber. Her 
               hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas separate 
               the two and they talk on monitored phones. Andrea, frazzled, 
               twirls an unlit cigarette.

                                     ANDREA
                         ...I spoke to your new lawyer about 
                         the appeal. He's sure he can get you 
                         off on self-defense, so if you're 
                         patient.

                                     EVAN
                         How long will I be in here?

                                     ANDREA
                         I don't know. These things take time.

                                     EVAN
                         How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?

               Andrea's look tells him to look for hope elsewhere.

                                     EVAN
                         What about my journals, Mom? Did you 
                         bring the ones I asked for?

               Andrea nods, holding up two comp books. "AGE 7" and "AGE 
               13".

                                     ANDREA
                         I found these. The others are still 
                         in storage.

                                     EVAN
                         Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them 
                         all!

                                     ANDREA
                         Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I 
                         think it's far more important to 
                         focus on your case right now.

               Evan looks as if he's about to disagree with her, but he 
               closes his mouth and placates her.

                                     EVAN
                         Sure, Mom. You're right. Just try to 
                         tell Kayleigh I'm sorry.

               And officer signals Evan and points to his watch.

                                     ANDREA
                         I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise 
                         me you'll hang on, Ev.

               They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone. He 
               hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear.

               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY

               Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching 
               his journals. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches 
               over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch.

               Evan, totally violated, turns white with rage.

                                     KARL
                         Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.

               Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when --

               Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his 
               hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he 
               rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at 
               the same time. A minor tug of war.

                                     EVAN
                         Let go! They're mine!

               Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn 
               pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental.

                                     EVAN
                         Motherfucker!

               Evan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick 
               lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the 
               journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED 
               RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as 
               Rick and Evan look up to see --

               ANGLE ON

               OFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an 
               upper tier, even more officers with more rifles.

               Their barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick 
               to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals.

                                     KARL
                         We'll be comin' for you tonight, 
                         sister.

               Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few 
               pages on the floor.

               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY

               Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages. He looks through 
               them. Nothing there.

               Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his "Age 7" 
               journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his 
               bed.

               INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

               Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches 
               whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him. Evan is 
               completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack. Karl 
               makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads:

                                     KARL
                              (from Evan's journal)
                         Today I found my grandfather's death 
                         certificate. He died in a nut house, 
                         just like my father. Mom denies it, 
                         but she thinks I'm gonna end up the 
                         same way...

               The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" 
               and "nut job." Evan rushes past them and they make chicken 
               clucks at him.

               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

               Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other 
               prisoners working out.

               Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him 
               from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a 
               white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice.

               Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ 
               tattoos all over Carlos' back.

                                     EVAN
                         You're religious Carlos, you believe 
                         that bit about "the Lord works in 
                         mysterious ways?"

                                     CARLOS
                         Straight up.

                                     EVAN
                         Because I think he sent me to your 
                         cell on purpose. For you to help me.

                                     CARLOS
                         Shit. I knew you were crazy.

                                     EVAN
                         I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks 
                         to me in my dreams.

               Carlos scoffs whatever.

                                     EVAN
                         Pack of smokes says I can prove it 
                         to you.

               Carlos is suddenly interested.

               INT. EVAN'S CELL - LATER

               Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes 
               up a conversation.

               Carlos looks dumbfounded.

                                     EVAN
                         So when I'm out, I need you to watch 
                         my face and hands closely.

                                     CARLOS
                         You need to see the prison shrink, 
                         man.

               Their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart 
               by, Evan looking up expectantly.

                                     EVAN
                         Anything today?

                                     CONVICT
                         Yep. Just not for you.

               Disappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos. Holds up his journal 
               entry.

                                     EVAN
                         Just tell me if anything weird 
                         happens.

                                     CARLOS
                         Weirder than this?

                                     EVAN
                         Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could 
                         happen I guess.

               Evan studies the page.

               JOURNAL ENTRY

               "On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I didn't 
               do. Mommy wont let me see it."

               Then as he starts reading it to himself, the bars behind him 
               almost imperceptibly VIBRATE --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY - 1989

               Evan, seven, COMES TO in an old familiar place. WE are back 
               in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class. All of the children 
               draw colorful pictures. Evan sees some paper spindles sitting 
               on Mrs. Boswell's desk. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell 
               firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own 
               desk.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         No monkey business, Evan. Sit still 
                         and finish your drawing.

               Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He 
               smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.

                                     MRS. BOSWELL
                         That's great everyone! Just imagine 
                         anything you want to be. There are 
                         no limits.

               Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands 
               over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick.

               When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the 
               two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer 
               a number of paper notes and messages.

               Evan looks over to see Mrs. Boswell holding up his drawing, 
               horrified.

                                     EVAN
                              (musically)
                         Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?

               She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-
               year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles!

               The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant 
               where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES.

                                                         AND WE'RE BACK TO:

               INT. EVAN'S PRISON CELL - DAY - 2002

               Evan comes to as ECHOES OF SCREAMING CHILDREN FADE. Alertness 
               slowly creeps back up on him as he hears:

                                     CARLOS
                         Oh sweet Jesus. It's true. It's a 
                         miracle! A miracle!

               Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence.

                                     CARLOS
                         Your hands. The stigmata!

               Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm.

                                     EVAN
                         What did you see? What did it look 
                         like?

                                     CARLOS
                              (laughing)
                         Signs of the Lord. They just appeared 
                         out of nowhere. I thought you were 
                         loco!

                                     EVAN
                         So you believe me?

               Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box 
               of cigarettes.

               INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Evan nervously approaches. A CREW of Aryans block his path.

                                     EVAN
                         I want to make a deal.

               The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who 
               grins and signals to let Evan pass.

               INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. 
               They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.

                                     EVAN
                         Look. I'm new to all this but I think 
                         I get how things work. You gotta 
                         join a gang or else end up dead meat.

               They continue to stare.

                                     EVAN
                         Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be 
                         with no niggers or spics. So how do 
                         we do this? You gotta work your way 
                         up, and I'm the new guy.
                              (looking ill)
                         So... should I... I mean, do I suck 
                         your dicks right now?

               Karl and Rick exchange looks.

                                     KARL
                         Is your blood pure?

                                     EVAN
                              (angry)
                         I ain't no fucking kike if that's 
                         what you mean.

               Rick stands. All muscle.

                                     RICK
                         Let's see what you got. And watch 
                         the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving 
                         without 'em.

               Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. 
               Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles. Evan looks 
               miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes 
               past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall 
               and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch!

               Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around 
               his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's 
               face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf.

               Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, 
               as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell.

                                     EVAN
                         Carlos!

               Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses 
               his girth against the cell door.

               Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as 
               the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses 
               on the words. Chanting quickly.

                                     EVAN
                         We took the woods behind the junkyard 
                         just to make sure we wouldn't bump 
                         into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke 
                         yet.

               WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF 
               BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans 
               storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY - 1995

               Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Evan stumbles 
               at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated. 
               A sinister victory smile.

                                     EVAN
                         Rot in hell you fucking animals.

               Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. 
               Evan shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his 
               bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them.

                                     EVAN
                         Wait. Before we --

               He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an 
               awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine 
               young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering 
               before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.  
               Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.

                                     EVAN
                         We need something to cut open the 
                         sack!

               Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity.

               Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a 
               razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers 
               it to Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         I want you to take this, Lenny. 
                         Today's your day of atonement. I 
                         know how guilty you feel about that 
                         woman and her baby --

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.

                                     EVAN
                              (frantic)
                         Now's the only time!
                              (to Lenny)
                         Today you get a chance to redeem 
                         yourself. Start over with a clean 
                         slate. Tabula rasa --

                                     LENNY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're acting crazy!

                                     EVAN
                              (desperate; to Lenny)
                         Please. If you've ever trusted me 
                         before, trust me on this one.

               Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand.

                                     EVAN
                         Cut the rope.

               Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away.

               EXT. JUNKYARD - LATER

               Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Tommy's voice hitches, 
               eyes watering from pent up frustration.

                                     TOMMY
                         Listen to me good, Evan...

                                     EVAN
                         I'll do whatever you want. You don't 
                         want me to ever see Kayleigh again, 
                         fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, 
                         you kill him now and they'll stick 
                         you in juvy for sure. And I know 
                         you'd never leave your sister alone 
                         with your father.

               Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. A 
               look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even.

               Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes 
               screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of 
               the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way 
               through Tommy's throat!

               Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys 
               the scene in shock:

                                     EVAN
                         Oh fuck, Lenny, no!

               Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in 
               his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and 
               SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat.

               Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack.

               EVAN'S POV

               Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as 
               if operating a jack-hammer.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002

               Evan comes to in a familiar place. His original college dorm - 
               ONLY BACKWARDS.

                                     EVAN
                         Christ. Help me.

               He sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings. When 
               suddenly, Evan clutches his head in severe pain.

               A MONTAGE OF IMAGES ASSAULT HIM:

               INT. SORORITY BEDROOM - DAY

               Color memories of Kayleigh's sorority fade to BLACK and WHITE 
               and dissipate.

               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT - 2002

               Memories of Evan's vandalized car fade to BLACK and WHITE 
               and dissipate.

               INT. PENITENTIARY - DAY - 2002

               The faces of Karl and Rick all turn grainy...

               INT. COLLEGE - EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               As new images of THUMPER become more BRILLIANT.

               INT. SUNNYVALE - PADDED ROOM - DAY - 2005

               A new image overwhelms the others: Lenny, 13, with dark, 
               soulless eyes wearing a straight-jacket in a padded room.

               BACK TO EVAN:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan's eyes roll back in his head. He shakes uncontrollably 
               and blood pours from his nose.

               Thumper opens the door, sees Evan convulsing and jumps back 
               in horror. He scans the hallways for assistance.

                                     THUMPER
                         Someone call 9-1-1!

               INT. SUNNYVALE LABORATORY - DAY

               Evan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of 
               CAT-scans. The machines are now state of the art and the lab 
               room has been redecorated.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Andrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches Dr. 
               Redfield post CAT-scan results on the light box. A young 
               nurse pushes Evan, in a wheelchair, into the doctor's office.

                                     EVAN
                         Okay, doc. What's the damage? How 
                         much time have I got?

                                     ANDREA
                         Cute, Evan.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It's a little complicated. I haven't 
                         seen results exactly like these 
                         before.

                                     EVAN
                         Are you sure? Not even with my father?

               Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Actually, these tests weren't 
                         available twenty years ago.

                                     ANDREA
                         So what did you find.

               Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to 
               the outer lining of Evan's brain.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         This is where we're finding most of 
                         the hemorrhaging. The outer lining 
                         of the cerebral cortex.

                                     EVAN
                              (nonplussed)
                         Lemme guess. Would that be where the 
                         memories are stored?

               Dr. Redfield stares ahead. Transfixed by the slides.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         I've never seen anything like this. 
                         I've compared these to the ones taken 
                         last year, and there's evidence of 
                         severe hemorrhaging and massive neural 
                         reconstruction.

               Andrea stares at him blankly. Evan impatiently "pops wheelies" 
               in the wheel chair.

                                     ANDREA
                         What does that mean for Evan?

                                     EVAN
                              (to Andrea)
                         He's saying it's like forty years 
                         worth of new memories have been jammed 
                         in my brain since last year. Overload 
                         city. 'Sat about the gist of it, 
                         doc?

               Dr. Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. 
               Evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs.

                                     EVAN
                              (to Andrea)
                         Mind if I wait in the car? The 
                         lighting here bugs my eyes.

               Andrea nods. Evan shakes Dr. Redfield's hand.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, it's nice seeing you again. 
                         But you know, people to see, things 
                         to read...

               Andrea shoots Dr. Redfield an apologetic look. Evan heads 
               out the door, accidentally knocking Dr. Redfield's jacket to 
               the floor. He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it.

               INT. SUNNYVALE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Outside the office, Evan inspects Dr. Redfield's KEYS and 
               attached SECURITY CARD and smiles. Evan covertly winds himself 
               through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the 
               staff.

               He finally sees a wing marked "CRIMINALLY INSANE". Evan looks 
               around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the 
               security card to open the door. He looks in every room of 
               the wing until he finds --

               INT. SUNNYVALE - LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.

               Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in 
               tight leather restraints. The dark five o'clock shadow and 
               his malicious grin radiate evil.

               His black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous 
               intent.

               Lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see Evan. That is, 
               if he's aware of Evan's presence at all...

                                     EVAN
                         Is there anything you need? Anything 
                         I can get you?

               Nothing from Lenny.

                                     EVAN
                         What about the models, man? Bet I 
                         can get you a shitload of models up 
                         in here.

               Still nothing. Not even a glance in his direction. Evan sighs 
               and gives up.

                                     EVAN
                         Okay, Lenny. Just wanted to say "hi".

               Evan turns around to leave.

                                     LENNY
                         You knew the whole time, didn't you?
                              (Evan spins around)
                         When you put the blade in my hand, 
                         you knew something big was going to 
                         happen. Didn't you?!

                                     EVAN
                              (jaw dropped)
                         Y... yes. I guess I did.

               Lenny's eyes seethe with hate.

                                     LENNY
                         Then you should be where I am. You 
                         should be where I am.

               Evan backs away, face guilt-stricken.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY

               Evan enters his dormroom (where everything's backwards), 
               reaches under his bed and is relieved to find the journal 
               marked "AGE 7".

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY

               Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops 
               himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the 
               entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale.

               JOURNAL ENTRY

               "Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is 
               crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad."

               Evan takes a calming breath and begins reading.

                                     EVAN
                              (as if reciting a 
                              mantra)
                         Today I get to meet my father. His 
                         name is Jason and he is crazy...

               Evan gets some strange looks, but continues. As he does, the 
               trees and frisbee-playing students behind him VIBRATE and 
               SHUDDER.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SUNNYVALE VISITOR'S CHAMBER - DAY - 1989

               Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met 
               his father, Jason.

               Jason waits patiently for young Evan to finish his sentence.

                                     JASON
                         Are you okay? You looked like you 
                         were somewhere else for a second 
                         there.

                                     EVAN
                         Look, Jason, I need some fast answers 
                         if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.

               Jason is completely thrown.

                                     JASON
                         I was praying this curse would have 
                         ended with me.

                                     EVAN
                         But it didn't. And now I need info 
                         to make things right again and you're 
                         the only one who can give it to me.

                                     JASON
                              (frustrated)
                         There is no "right". When you change 
                         who people are, you destroy who they 
                         were.

                                     EVAN
                         Who's to say you can't make things 
                         better?

               Jason seems extremely upset to hear Evan say this.

                                     JASON
                         You can't play God, son. It must end 
                         with me. Just by being here, you may 
                         be killing your mother.

                                     EVAN
                         Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard 
                         when I've made everything perfect 
                         again.

               Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, 
               and grabs hold of Evan's throat.

               EVAN'S POV

               As Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a 
               trick of the light where Jason's head seems to VIBRATE against 
               the ceiling.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY - 2002

               Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he 
               realizes his surroundings. Heartbroken, he shuts the journal 
               and stands up shakily.

               INT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EARLY EVENING

               Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As 
               he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively. 
               Guarding his food.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Just get out, didja?

                                     EVAN
                         Huh?

                                     WAITRESS
                              (re: his arm)
                         Nothing. Just that my brother did a 
                         stint in the pen and he used to eat 
                         like that.

                                     EVAN
                              (defensively)
                         I come from a big family.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Meant no offense.

                                     EVAN
                         None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh 
                         Miller still work here?

                                     WAITRESS
                              (confused)
                         Sorry. Never heard of her.

               EXT. MILLER HOUSE - EVENING

               Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated 
               mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off 
               the sides of the house. Inside, Mr. Miller yells at someone.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Just shut the hell up already! Can't 
                         a man get a little goddman peace in 
                         his own home!
                              (Evan rings doorbell)
                         Oh, for Christ's sake, now what?

               Mr. Miller opens the door and sees Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Don't suppose you're here to sell 
                         cookies?

               In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves 
               him through the house and into a wall.

                                     EVAN
                         Good guess, fuckbag.
                              (off Miller's startled 
                              face)
                         Remember me now? We had a great chat 
                         once when I was seven.

               Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror.

                                     EVAN
                         One question, fuckbag. Where can I 
                         find your daughter?

               EXT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

               Evan walks past some junkies and enters.

               INT. SEEDY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

               Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway 
               of an incredibly seedy motel. The kind with hourly rates. He 
               knocks on a door.

               Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and 
               immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes. She 
               puts out an expression of disappointment.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh, I thought you were my eight 
                         o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting 
                         someone.

                                     EVAN
                         Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?

               She looks around, waves him in.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         If I knew you were coming I'd have 
                         cleaned the stains off the sheets.

               INT. KAYLEIGH'S SEEDY HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, 
               yellowed cotton balls and brown-spotted squares of tin foil. 
               Evan doesn't hesitate to sit on the "soiled" bed.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         What do you want?

               Evan can't speak. His eyes begin to water.

                                     EVAN
                         I just needed to see... a friendly 
                         face.

               His sincerity touches her.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, time is money, Evan. So you...

               Evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser. 
               Kayleigh eyes the wallet. But makes no move to pick it up.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes 
                         for an old friend, right?

               Tears fall freely from Evan's eyes.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational 
                         humor.

                                     EVAN
                         I get it. You can drop it now.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (angry again)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work 
                         make you uncomfortable, precious?

                                     EVAN
                         No. Just that you need to hurt me 
                         with it. I've been where you've been.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Ha! Where's that?

                                     EVAN
                         The bottom. When you're just a piece 
                         of meat waiting for the next attack.

               Kayleigh watches Evan silently.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         What's happened to you?

                                     EVAN
                         You wouldn't believe me. I mean, 
                         people always say, "You wouldn't 
                         believe me", but in this case, it's 
                         not even worth trying.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I've seen some sickening shit. I 
                         don't blink twice anymore, especially 
                         in your case.

                                     EVAN
                         Why's that?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Because you're... different.

                                     EVAN
                         Different? How?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Let me ask you a question. Just a 
                         little one that's been gnawing at me 
                         for years.

                                     EVAN
                         Yeah?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         On the bridge. How did you know that 
                         Tommy had your dog? That was no 
                         fucking hunch.

                                     EVAN
                         Do you remember when I was a kid and 
                         I had those blackouts?

               Evan continues and Kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense 
               interest and matched skepticism.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO LATER:

               INT. DINER - NIGHT

               Kayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner. She 
               lights up an after-dinner smoke.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You're right, Evan, I don't believe 
                         you.

                                     EVAN
                         I never thought you would. That's 
                         why I've never bothered to tell a 
                         soul until now, and why I never will 
                         again.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         I'm the only person you've told? 
                         That's a great line. Does that make 
                         other girls swoon? Do they actually 
                         eat up this bullshit?

                                     EVAN
                         I couldn't give a shit if you believe 
                         me or not, and frankly I'm too tired 
                         to prove it to you.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh? There's proof now?

                                     EVAN
                              (tired)
                         Shit. I dunno. How would I know about 
                         the twin moles on your inner thigh?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Anyone with fifty bucks could tell 
                         you that.

                                     EVAN
                         Then forget that. How about... you 
                         prefer the smell of a skunk to 
                         flowers, you hate cilantro because 
                         for reasons unknown to you, it reminds 
                         you of your step-sister.

               Kayleigh's jaw drops.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes 
                         go numb. I'm sure your clientele 
                         aren't privy to that one.

               Kayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes.

                                     EVAN
                         I just thought you should know.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Know what?

                                     EVAN
                         That I didn't leave you there to 
                         rot.

               Kayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded, then 
               her eyes fill with distrust and contempt.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         There's one major hole in your story.

                                     EVAN
                         Which is?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         There is no fuckin' way on this planet 
                         or any other that I was in some 
                         fuckin' sorority.

               She opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Sure you don't want your wallet?

                                     EVAN
                         Don't think I'll need it where I'm 
                         going.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Off to change everyone's life again, 
                         is that it? Maybe this time you'll 
                         pop up in some mansion while I wind 
                         up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm over it. Whenever I try to help 
                         anyone it all turns to shit.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've 
                         already done so much for me. Hell, 
                         why don't you go back in time and 
                         save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then 
                         maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and 
                         ruin my family.

               She gets up and puts on her coat.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Oh, here's one! Go back when I'm 
                         seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's 
                         handicam, you know, straighten me 
                         out a bit...

               She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY

               Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar 
               sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO-
               ED. On Evan's bed.

                                     EVAN
                         Get out. Both of you.

                                     THUMPER
                         Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be 
                         okay with you bein' sick and all.

               Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it 
               against a wall above Thumper's head.

                                     EVAN
                         I'm not saying it again.

               Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets 
               and leave. Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and 
               breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are 
               intact. He sifts through them again. He finally finds the 
               passage he needs. Something catches the corner of Evan's 
               eyes and he turns to examine it.

               To the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE 
               CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ.

                                     EVAN
                              (humble)
                         Lord give me the strength and guidance 
                         I need to set things right.

               As he begins reading a passage to himself, SOUNDS ECHO 
               backward at us from another time and place. And the entire 
               ROOM SHIMMERS around him --

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOUSE - DAY - 1995

               Evan comes to as he, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy -- all thirteen -- 
               watch Mrs. Halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across 
               the street with intense anticipation. Evan suddenly comes to 
               life and makes himself visible, running across the street 
               shouting.

                                     EVAN
                         Lady, stay back! Don't go near the 
                         mailbox!

               Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically 
               as she absently continues toward the mailbox.

                                     EVAN
                         I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

               Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and 
               Tommy shrugs and follows after him.

                                     LENNY
                         There's a bomb in the mailbox. Get 
                         away!

               Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid 
               confession and rolls his eyes at the situation. Evan positions 
               himself between Mrs. Halpern and the mailbox, frantically 
               waving his hand at her to stay back, because she's STILL 
               COMING.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'll save you lady!

               Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit 
               too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, 
               but no major injuries.

               Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail --

               BOOM!

               The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards 
               dramatically.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the 
               wall, the sheets are the same. Even the familiar sounds of 
               Thumper having sex under the covers.

                                     EVAN
                         I thought I told you two to beat it.

               Evan's face falls as he hears a familiar voice, but not 
               Thumper's.

                                     LENNY
                         What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you 
                         up?

               Evan is confused by Lenny's presence, but smiles to himself 
               and shakes his head "no".

                                     EVAN
                         No, it's cool.
                              (re: Lenny's okay)
                         Really cool.

               Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no 
               hand. No arm, really, either. Just two FLESHY STUMPS!

               Evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations.

               A FLOOD OF MEMORIES ASSAULT HIM:

               We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up 
               from the age of thirteen with NO ARMS, and requiring a 
               WHEELCHAIR.

               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER LOBBY - DAY - 1995

               Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap 
               as Lenny pushes the wheelchair.

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - 1995

               Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles. 
               Andrea, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny all clap.

               EXT. CHURCH - DAY - 1995

               Tommy pushes Evan to church.

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan screams as blood pours from his nose. Lenny is out of 
               bed at once to help him... as is KAYLEIGH! (Now beautiful 
               and natural looking).

               QUICK SERIES OF FLASHES:

               EXT. LAKE - DAY - 1999

               Lenny and Kayleigh, as teens, sit together with Evan at the 
               far end of the boat.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - 1999

               Evan looks on longingly as Lenny and Kayleigh become lovers 
               in high school.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - 1999

               A campfire. Evan sips from a BEER CAP as Lenny and Kayleigh 
               make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval.

               BACK TO EVAN:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY - 2002

               Evan's in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and 
               Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through. Kayleigh carries a 
               pair of prosthetic arms in her hands.

               Evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump.

                                     EVAN
                         Where are we going?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         We have to get you to Sunnyvale. 
                         You're having one of your famous 
                         hemorrhages.

                                     EVAN
                         Stop! Take me back!

                                     LENNY
                         Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your 
                         mother would kill me.

               Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of 
               the wheelchair. Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan. 
               As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a 
               CROWD GATHERS.

               Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd 
               that titters and snickers in the background.

                                     EVAN
                         Take me back, Lenny!
                              (teeth clenched)
                         You owe me that much.

               Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         What are you geeks looking at? Must 
                         be nice to be so goddamned perfect, 
                         huh? Fucking losers.

               The crowd breaks up and leaves.

               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY

               It's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair 
               around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE 
               call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world.

                                     LENNY
                         'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the 
                         party! Don't even think I'm giving 
                         you my lab notes either! Think I 
                         like getting up for "eight thirty's"?

               Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation 
               stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by. 
               Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent.

                                     LENNY
                         Hey, there's Tommy.

               Evan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and 
               handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus 
               Crusade for Christ." Tommy seems good-natured now, working 
               hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan 
               rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan.

                                     TOMMY
                         I did what you said, man! We're 
                         pooling our student funds with Hillel 
                         House and we're going to have an 
                         Awareness Dance.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh goody, nothing like spinning my 
                         chair around to a techno mix of Hava 
                         Nagila til I puke.

               Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs 
               and nods back to him.

                                     LENNY
                         Uh, we should be getting to class 
                         now.

                                     EVAN
                         Forget it. What's the point of Psych 
                         now? Tomorrow I could wake up as 
                         some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

               Another exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Let's go for a stroll.

               Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To 
               the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy.

               Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically" 
               will to open, close, open, close...

                                     EVAN
                         So Tommy's really into this Jesus 
                         kick, huh?

               Kayleigh looks at him curiously.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         You know how spiritual he's gotten 
                         ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and 
                         Katie.

                                     EVAN
                         He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the 
                         twisted fuck.

               Kayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually 
               uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a 
               granola bar and hands it to him.

               His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She 
               seems more confused.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Is something the matter?

                                     EVAN
                              (re: prosthetic arms)
                         Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed 
                         or something.

               She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.

                                     EVAN
                         Kayleigh? Do you ever think about 
                         "us?" I mean, wonder if it could 
                         ever have been different between the 
                         two of us?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Sure, Evan, why not? You were the 
                         first person I really ever cared 
                         about.

                                     EVAN
                         I was?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         That's why when I was little I never 
                         went to live with my mother.

                                     EVAN
                         I don't get it.

                                     KAYLEIGH
                              (feeding another bite)
                         When my folks split, they gave me 
                         and Tommy a choice who we wanted to 
                         live with. I couldn't stand my dad, 
                         but I knew if I moved to my mom's 
                         I'd never see you again.

                                     EVAN
                         I never knew that. So then you still 
                         sometimes think of us... together?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         It's crossed my mind from time to 
                         time.

                                     EVAN
                              (hopeful)
                         And...?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Well a lot of things cross my mind. 
                         I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. 
                         I can play out the movie of our entire 
                         lives in under a second. Boom -- we 
                         fall in love -- get married -- two 
                         kids, your keen analytical insight 
                         matched to my generous nature -- 
                         kids grow old as do we, relatively 
                         stable relationships, matching burial 
                         plots, the whole bit. It took a lot 
                         longer to spit out than to imagine.

                                     EVAN
                         Then you think it might have worked 
                         out?

                                     KAYLEIGH
                         Why not? But that's not how things 
                         wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's 
                         your friend. And there it ends.

               She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically. 
               Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading 
               tone.

                                     EVAN
                         Would it make any difference if I 
                         told you that no one could possibly 
                         love anyone as much as I love you?

               Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan 
               turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on 
               Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny.

               Evan can't take his eyes off her.

               ANGLE ON

               Lenny kissing Kayleigh. In painful slo-mo. Evan turns away, 
               utterly heartbroken.

               INT. HANDICAPPED BATHROOM - DAY

               CLOSE UP

               Evan's stump turns on a BATHTUB FAUCET.

               REVEAL:

               Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub that's filling with 
               water. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over.

               The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes 
               his peace and takes a final breath.

               And the water spills over the side of the tub. All Evan can 
               do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.

               A beat. Then the door opens.

               TOMMY ENTERS. Immediately sizing up the situation.

                                     TOMMY
                         You forgot to put the toaster on the 
                         edge.

               Tommy casually turns off the water, then pops open the DRAIN. 
               The water level lowers to Evan's mouth.

                                     EVAN
                         But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like 
                         toast. And that's really all that 
                         matters now.

               Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor 
               by the tub. He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder.

               Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, 
               ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's. Taking the 
               comfort offered.

                                     TOMMY
                         I'll get you changed. Visiting hours 
                         are almost up.

               INT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL - EVENING

               Tommy rolls Evan through a quiet hospital corridor.

                                     EVAN
                              (looking around)
                         What, did mom get transferred again?

               Tommy frowns, confused, then rolls Evan into --

               INT. ANDREA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Evan is startled to see Andrea hooked up to several IV's, an 
               oxygen tank and a respirator. Several oxygen hoses connect 
               to a tracheotomy tube.

               Tommy smiles and kisses Andrea on the cheek. She tousles his 
               hair in return.

               Evan can hardly speak. As Tommy begins to wheel Evan's chair 
               closer to Andrea's bedside, Andrea utters a faint whisper.

                                     ANDREA
                         Looking. Good. Kiddo.

               Evan eyes her MEDICAL CLIPBOARD as he's wheeled by.

                                     EVAN
                              (reading)
                         Lung cancer?

                                     TOMMY
                         Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts 
                         lately.

               Andrea flinches to hear this. Evan stares at her, eyes wide.

                                     EVAN
                         Right... You started chain smoking 
                         after I blew myself up.

               Evan suddenly seems sick with guilt.

                                     EVAN
                         There must be a way to fix this.

                                     ANDREA
                         Fix?

                                     EVAN
                         I just need the entry about the 
                         blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I 
                         never even got the chance to write 
                         it.

               A flicker of recognition registers in her eyes.

                                     ANDREA
                         Is Evan... different?

                                     TOMMY
                         He's just going through some tough 
                         times.

                                     EVAN
                         Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.

                                     TOMMY
                         I think I'll go check out the chapel.

                                     ANDREA
                         You're. Acting. Like your father.

                                     EVAN
                         Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my 
                         age when he started going crazy 
                         doesn't mean that I'm nuts.

               Andrea is shocked.

                                     ANDREA
                         How. Did you. Know that?

                                     EVAN
                         You told me that on Parents' Weekend. 
                         Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or 
                         you.

               She uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen 
               tube and forces herself to speak in a sick, GRAVELY manner.

                                     ANDREA
                         Just. Like. Jason.

                                     EVAN
                         Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out 
                         of here.

               He pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself 
               out of the room.

               Andrea forces her loudest raspy scream.

                                     ANDREA
                         Stop him. Stop him. Stop him...

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT

               Lenny tears through old cardboard boxes in Evan's closet. 
               Evan watches nearby.

                                     LENNY
                         Are you sure you even packed it?

                                     EVAN
                         My mom packed for me. I think she 
                         sent everything I ever owned. So 
                         we'll see.

               Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk 
               on the floor. Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums 
               fall on the floor.

                                     LENNY
                         Is this it?

               Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal. AGE 
               7.

                                     LENNY
                         What do you need it for? I don't get 
                         you lately.

                                     EVAN
                         Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you 
                         for one last favor.

                                     LENNY
                         What?

                                     EVAN
                         Shhh. I need to concentrate on the 
                         blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.

                                     LENNY
                              (concerned)
                         Destroy it?

                                     EVAN
                         If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom 
                         never woulda started smoking in the 
                         first place. Now shhhh.

               Lenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches 
               Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat.

               ON EVAN

               As new sounds ECHO BACKWARD. There's a --

               SHIMMER!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING - 1989

               Evan comes to in his childhood kitchen. He is only seven 
               years old. He coughs up Lucky Charms that have "magically" 
               appeared in his mouth. On a journal before him is the recently 
               written passage:

               JOURNAL ENTRY

               "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I 
               will mete there father and see what a real dad is like."

               Andrea is nowhere in sight. Evan springs to his feet and 
               flexes his real hands triumphantly.

                                     EVAN
                         Yes. Now how do I destroy the 
                         blockbuster?

               He rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large 
               butcher knife and grabs it. He tucks it into his sock but it 
               won't fit. He's still debating what to do when:

               ANDREA WALKS IN and is startled by the unexpected sight of 
               Evan holding a huge knife.

               Evan sees her but remains expressionless. Andrea's face 
               blanches.

                                     ANDREA
                         Evan? What are you doing with that 
                         knife?

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT - 2002

               Evan comes to to find Lenny still staring at him. Waiting 
               for something big to happen.

                                     EVAN
                         Well, that didn't work...

               Evan flips a single page of his journal and tries again. He 
               reads to himself, then relaxes his head --

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. MILLER'S BASEMENT - DAY - 1989

               Evan, seven again, stands in the basement dressed in his 
               Robin Hood costume as Mr. Miller prepares for the sex scene.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Now in this part of the story, Robin 
                         Hood just married Maid Marian and 
                         they have to kiss and stuff like 
                         grown-ups do.

               Kayleigh giggles. There seems to be a new glint of 
               intelligence in Evan's eyes as he adjusts to his new 
               surroundings.

                                     EVAN
                         Wait! I need my belt!

               Mr. Miller is puzzled, but watches Evan SKIP to the fireplace.

                                     EVAN
                              (overly childlike)
                         Loo loo, skip to my loo. Loo loo, 
                         skip to my loo.

               Mr. Miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as Evan quickly 
               finds Mr. Miller's old army thermos in the bottom drawer of 
               the dresser, opens it and shakes out the blockbuster.

                                     EVAN
                         Loo, loo, skip to my loo.

               He tries to crack it with his own hands, but his seven-year 
               old body is too weak.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Hey kid, don't bother with the belt.

               Mr. Miller finally turns around and sees Evan banging the 
               blockbuster on the table. Shock registers in Mr. Miller's 
               eyes and he takes a step towards Evan.

                                     EVAN
                         Back off, fuckbag!

               Mr. Miller freezes on that, and Evan smiles at him.

                                     EVAN
                         Amazing. That word never fails to 
                         make an impression with you...

               Mr. Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad 
                         boy or I'll tell mommy you were 
                         naughty.

                                     EVAN
                         And I'll tell the Child Protective 
                         Services about your kiddie porn 
                         endeavors. One step closer and I'll 
                         shove this up your ass!

               Kayleigh's mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene. 
               Tommy, hiding at the top of the stairs, slowly creeps down 
               to get a better view.

               Evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden "strike 
               anywhere" matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes.

                                     MR. MILLER
                         That's dangerous! You could blow 
                         your hands off!

                                     EVAN
                         Been there, done that.

               Evan, standing near the fireplace, defiantly strikes the 
               match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse.

               Mr. Miller charges Evan just as the fuse is lit! Mr. Miller 
               knocks the blockbuster from Evan's hand and it rolls towards 
               the other side of the room, resting peacefully against the 
               video camera.

               Kayleigh's eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she 
               bends down to pick it up --

                                     MR. MILLER/TOMMY/EVAN
                         Kayleigh! NOOOOOooooo!

               EXT. MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY - 1989

               BOOM! The blast is deafening.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. SUNNYVALE - EVAN'S ROOM - DAY - 2002

               Evan, twenty, wakes up with a bloody nose.

                                     EVAN
                         Oh God, Kayleigh...

               Evan gets a new series of QUICK IMAGES and FLASHED FACES.

               INT. FAMILY COURTROOM - DAY - 1989

               Evan (now seven) is institutionalized before a judge.

               INT. SUNNYVALE INSTITUTION - DAY - 1989-1994

               Evan (seven through twelve) GROWS UP in an institution.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY - 1989-1994

               Evan undergoes years of therapy under Redfield's care.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S ROOM - SUNNYVALE - DAY - 2002

               Evan lies in a room, same posters from college adorn the 
               walls. Blood flows freely now.

                                     EVAN
                              (sobbing uncontrollably)
                         Kayleigh... no! You can't die again! 
                         I won't let this happen. I won't!

               Evan fights off the pain and looks under his bed for 
               something.

                                     EVAN
                         Where are they?!

               His journals are missing! He runs from the room.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFCIE - DAY

               Evan runs into Dr. Redfield's office just as another patient 
               is leaving.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We 
                         don't meet for another hour.

                                     EVAN
                         Where are my goddamn books?

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Books?

                                     EVAN
                         My journals! Where are they?

               The doctor looks heartbroken, as if Evan has had a relapse.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         It kills me to have to go through 
                         this again. There are no journals. 
                         There never were. It's part of this 
                         fantasy world your mind created to 
                         cope with the guilt of killing...

               Evan looks stunned. Refusing to believe it.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Think Evan. You've invented a disease 
                         that doesn't exist. Alternate 
                         universes with colleges, prisons, 
                         paraplegia...

                                     EVAN
                         But I... I need those books.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         You remind me of your father. He 
                         always screamed for a photo album 
                         even though he never had one.

                                     EVAN
                         Photos?

               Evan's eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the 
               floor.

               INT. SUNNYVALE LABORATORY - DAY

               Evan lies on a platform and gets another series of CAT-scans.

               INT. EVAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Evan, no longer incapacitated, stares out the window into 
               the darkness. Alone.

               Trapped. Hopeless.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Later that day, Dr. Redfield posts the new CAT-scan slides 
               on the light box and shudders when he sees the results. Andrea 
               looks on anxiously.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         Jesus, no.

               Andrea, biting her nails, is unable to conceal her fear.

                                     ANDREA
                         No dances, just tell me.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                              (devastated)
                         The hemorrhaging... the neural damage 
                         is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised 
                         he still has use of his motor 
                         functions.

               Andrea begins to break down in tears. Evan secretly listens 
               in from the hallway.

               His gaunt face looks deep in thought. He takes a breath and 
               enters the lab, making sure not to look directly at his 
               weeping mother.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring 
                         those goofy old home movies we used 
                         to make?

               Andrea wipes tears away, nodding in advance.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Evan sees no one is watching him in the institution corridor 
               as he throws his weight into the door of the doctor's office, 
               breaking it open.

               Sporadically, severe VIBRATIONS invade Evan's environment, 
               threatening to distract him from his mission.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Evan enters the office and tears the file cabinets apart, 
               looking for something.

               His nose bleeds profusely and he repeatedly wipes the blood 
               off his face with irritation.

               Evan sees a cardboard marked TREBORN, E. Grabs it and hides 
               under the doctor's desk.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting 
               for him. An ALARM SOUNDS. GUARDS are shouting.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Evan, under the doctor's desk, grabs some paper and begins 
               writing in shorthand.

                                     EVAN
                         If anyone finds this, then I guess 
                         my plan didn't work and I'm already 
                         dead.

               Again, the world flutters as if it were attached to a paint-
               shaker. He takes a deep breath.

                                     EVAN
                         But I -- I can just go back to the 
                         beginning of all this, I might be 
                         able to save her.

               Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing...

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Dr. Redfield catches up with the rest of the guards.

                                     DR. REDFIELD
                         He's not in his room. Search the 
                         grounds.

               INT. DR. REDFIELD'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               The cardboard box is overturned. Evan finishes threading a 
               SUPER-8 film projector and turns it on. Careful not to let 
               any light spill against the wall, Evan projects it at the 
               underside of the desk.

               We see familiar home movie footage from his childhood: Lenny, 
               5, has a birthday party. Kayleigh is there.

               ANGLE ON EVAN'S EYES

               Getting lost in the memory.

               CHAOTIC NOISES of CHILDREN'S PARTY bleed into Evan's reality. 
               The world SHUDDERS UNCONTROLLABLY.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. LENNY'S BACKYARD - DAY - 1987

               Evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party. He's unexpectedly 
               gently prodded forward by Andrea.

                                     ANDREA
                         Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.

               Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five. She smiles 
               bashfully at him. An old memory comes back to him.

                                     KAYLEIGH (V.O.)
                         When my folks split, they gave me 
                         and Tommy a choice who we wanted to 
                         live with. I couldn't stand my dad, 
                         but I knew if I lived with my mom, 
                         I'd never see you again...

               Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of 
               this distant memory.

               He even inhales the aroma of the place. Savoring the moment. 
               He locks eyes with Kayleigh.

                                     ANDREA (O.S.)
                         He's not usually this shy.

               It's time. Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to 
               kiss her. Then whispers in her ear:

                                     EVAN
                         I hate you. If you ever come near me 
                         again, I'll kill you and your whole 
                         family.

               Kayleigh reacts predictably. Bursting into tears and runs 
               into Kayleigh's mother's arms.

                                     KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER
                         What did you say to her? What 
                         happened?!

               Evan ignores them. He can't take his eyes off Kayleigh.

                                     EVAN
                         Goodbye.

               His eyes well up.

               FLASH!

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002

               Evan wakes up with a bloody nose. He grabs a pillow and covers 
               his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him.

               Lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award-winning 
               flatworms project and hands it to Evan.

                                     LENNY (O.S.)
                         You alright? Should I call the doctor?

               Evan groans and shakes his head "no". He rides out the pain 
               like a seasoned pro.

               When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles 
               feebly.

                                     EVAN
                         I'll think I'll be alright this time.
                              (a new hope)
                         I really do.

               Lenny nods, still concerned.

               INT. COLLEGE - INCINERATOR ROOM - LATER

               Evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace. 
               He and Lenny carry cardboard boxes.

                                     LENNY
                         You sure about this?

               Evan nods. They silently dump tons of journals into the fire. 
               Evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, 
               photo albums, old report cards, etc. In they go.

               CLOSE ON

               Burning journals.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY - 2010

               Evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell 
               phone to his ear.

               TITLE CARD: YEARS LATER

                                     EVAN
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, Ma. I'm running a little late 
                         for lunch. One of my patients had a 
                         breakdown. Anyway, order some soup 
                         in the meantime. See ya soon.

               As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit 
               approaches from the other direction. Evan has to look closely, 
               but it's Kayleigh. A mature woman, now.

               He stumbles slightly, caught off guard. As she passes, her 
               eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's 
               no recognition. Evan watches her continue past him and down 
               the sidewalk.

               After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and 
               follows her.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               Roll credits...

1	FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE

Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint 
image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly 
image.

The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch 
television.

The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote
control. The hand changes channels frantically.

The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty
years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception.
Unfortunately for him  his cable is not hooked up.

STEVE
(looks at watch)
Jesus, where's the cable guy already?

END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE

1A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just 
moved in. The phone rings.

STEVEN
(into the phone)
Hello.

2	NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough 
looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television 
set.

ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic 
on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."

RICK
How's the move going?

3	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.

STEVEN
Horrible. The cable guy is missing in
action. Apparently he's going to be here
sometime between eight AM and my death.

RICK
You haven't called Robin have you?
Please tell me you didn't call her.

STEVEN
(sarcastically)
No, I'm giving her space.
(beat)
I can't believe she's doing this.

RICK
You never should have asked her to marry
you. You're the mad smotherer.

STEVEN
All she had to do was say no. She didn't
have to kick me out. I feel like Felix
Unger.

RICK
You forced her to evaluate the
relationship. If you didn't propose she
would never have realized how unhappy she
was.

STEVE
I don't want to talk about it.
So what time are you going to come by?

RICK
I can't. I'm working double shifts the
rest of the week.

STEVEN
It's my first night here. Don't do this
to me.

RICK
The other camera guy pulled out his back.
Besides, I spent the last two weeks with
you on my couch. Isn't that enough?

STEVEN
Fine, fine.

RICK
One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy
fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie
channels for free. Even the dirty ones.

STEVEN
I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no? I'll feel like an
idiot.

RICK
None of them say no, believe me. I'll
talk to you later.

Steven hangs up, and waits.

DISSOLVE TO:

4	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Steven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his 
ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it 
back in the box.

4A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck 
pulls into a gated side garage.

5	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Movers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs. Steven directs them as to where to put them.

CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 3:52 P.M.

6	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still 
nothing. He pulls it off frustrated.

7	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Many of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable 
to fill his day without cable.

STEVEN
Where the hell is he?

8	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Steven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.

CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.

9	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He 
picks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.

ROBIN (VO)
Hi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If
you are trying to reach Steven he can now
be reached at 555-3837.

Steven hangs up.

10	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SUNSET

Steven does sit ups. He looks at the clock.

CLOSE UP OF THE CLOCK - 6:48 P.M.

STEVEN
(to himself)
Forget it. Idiots.

He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.

11	INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his 
tension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.

THE DOORBELL RINGS
STEVEN
(annoyed)
Oh great.

THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES

Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.

STEVEN
Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!

12	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs to the door.

CABLE GUY (OS)
Hello! Cable Guy!

Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.

P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

The CABLE GUY is walking away.

INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

STEVEN
Hey, wait!

The Cable Guy turns back.

CABLE GUY
Well, look who decided to show up. I was
just gonna go collect my retirement
pension.

The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he 
speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.

STEVEN
You were supposed to be here four hours
ago.

CABLE GUY
Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to
know.

STEVEN
Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath
place, but now it's closed.
CABLE GUY

(turns to leave)
Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk
off!
(turns back smiling)
I'm just joking. Let's do this.
(looks around)
Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought
they'd get the floors clean after what
happened here.

STEVEN
What happened?

CABLE GUY
(long beat)
They had a lot of cats.

They walk into Steven's living room.

CABLE GUY
Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a
comment card.

He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.

CABLE GUY
Please mail it in when I am done.

STEVEN
These go to your boss?

CABLE GUY
No, they go to me. I'm a
perfectioniss perfectioniss
(he strains to lose his lisp)
perfectionisst.
Now let's take a look at what we're
dealing with.

The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.

CABLE GUY
Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me
baby. Tell me where you like it. That's
it baby.

He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.

CABLE GUY
Here's your sweet spot.

He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.

CABLE GUY
So your lady kicked you out.

STEVEN
What?

CABLE GUY
In preparing your service I noticed you
were previously wired across town at 1268
and a half Chestnut. Last week the
billing was transferred to one Robin
Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.

STEVEN
I really don't want to talk about it with
you. Could you please just install my
cable? I'm going to get dressed.

CABLE GUY
No sweat.

Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.

CABLE GUY
Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I
can access the floorboards. Don't be
spooked if you hear someone crawling
underneath you.

STEVEN
Okay, whatever.

Steven walks toward his bedroom.

CABLE GUY
Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be
channel surfing in no time.

The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.

13	INT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION

RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.

RIKKI KLIEMAN
(to camera)
So ends day fifty-four of the trial of
former child star Sam Sweet who has been
accused of shooting his twin brother,
Stan, in cold blood. The twins were
stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble"
which aired from nineteen seventy-seven
till nineteen eighty-four.

A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at 
various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year-
old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.

We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of 
Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.

RIKKI KLIEMAN
(to camera)
Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation
of their program. Hollywood chewed them
up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam
turned to petty larceny, while his more
impressionable brother, Stan, fell in
with a fringe cult called "The
Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to
tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside
of Sam. A burning need to be recognized
as an individual, not a person famous for
having an identical twin. A need that
took the form of four shotgun blasts on
the night of November fourteenth. And so
today his attorneys continue the unusual
defense of "Twin Envy."

ANGLE ON

Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.

STEVEN
How's it going?

The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.

CABLE GUY
Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I
hope they fry this bastard.

Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the 
room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs 
blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation 
impossible.

STEVEN
(looks around)
What happened?

CABLE GUY
(jumps to his feet)
The arrangement of your major appliances
and your furniture was causing some noisy
pics and hum bars in your reception. I
moved a few things. Cleared it right up.
Is that cool?

STEVEN
(non-confrontational)
I guess so.

CABLE GUY
You programmed?
(off of Steven's look)
Then let me slave your remotes.

He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at 
each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.

CABLE GUY
Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
alone.

STEVEN
So after this I'll only need one remote
for everything?

CABLE GUY
You know you're pretty good at this. You
could be a cable guy yourself.
(he finishes)
Now let me check your levels.

With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he 
clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving 
kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.

CABLE GUY
All right. That about does it. I just
have some paperwork for you to fill out.
Sign here.

Steven does.

CABLE GUY
That gave me power of attorney over you.
(beat)
Joking.

Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too 
long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want 
to leave.

CABLE GUY
I'm about finished here.
(beat)
Okay. I feel good about this.

Cable Guy walks to the door.

STEVEN
One thing.

CABLE GUY
(turns back immediately)
Yeah!

STEVEN
I uh I have this friend and he said
he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he
got free movie channels. Have you ever
heard of anything like that?

CABLE GUY
(deadly serious)
You mean illegal cable?

STEVEN
Uh yes.

CABLE GUY
Who told you that? I want his name.

STEVEN
Forget it.

CABLE GUY
You're offering me a bribe? What you
have just done is illegal, and in this
state if convicted, you could be fined
five-thousand dollars or spend six months
in a correctional facility.

STEVEN
Please that was dumb. I was just
making conversation 

CABLE GUY
(laughs)
I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up
little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All
it is is a push of a button.

He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.

STEVEN
Oh, great. How much?

CABLE GUY
Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge
you. Your girl just booted you.
Consider it one guy doing another guy a
solid.

STEVEN
That is so nice.

CABLE GUY
Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be
surprised how many customers treat you
like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or
something.
(hands him a card)
Here is my personal beeper number. It's
just for my preferred customers. Never
call the company, they'll just put you on
hold.

STEVEN
Thanks. Really.
(holds up comment card - jokes)
You're gonna get some good marks here.

CABLE GUY
Maybe some day I'll take you out to the
satellite and show you how all this stuff
works. It's really incredible.

STEVEN
Sure. We should do that one day.

CABLE GUY
How 'bout tomorrow?

STEVEN
Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.

CABLE GUY
What are you going to do, sit home and
stew about your ex?

STEVEN
No.

CABLE GUY
(insulted)
Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.
Sorry.

STEVEN
(guilty)
You didn't cross the line.

CABLE GUY
No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.
On the flip side.

The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into 
that.

(End Revision - Pink)

14	INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks 
impressed.

Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.

STEVEN
There are twenty-four classrooms; each
can be converted into a 1400 square foot
home. The facility has two tennis courts,
an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a
stage if the residents decide they want
to perform "Oklahoma."

Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.

STEVEN
The kitsch appeal of living in an old
schoolhouse should be very attractive to
young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And
most important, the structure is
available in foreclosure. If we put down
a cash bid, we're going to steal this
thing.

There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm 
around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.

MR. DANIELS
Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling
good?

STEVE
Yeah.

MR. DANIELS
Did I hear something about you having
some troubles at home?

STEVE
Robin and I have been having a difficult
time. I moved out, but I really think
it's only temporary.

MR. DANIELS
Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a
big mother. Know what I mean? If it
fails, corporate's going to have my ass.
I've got confidence in you, but you hear
where I'm coming from, bro?

STEVEN
Absolutely. Now I've got more time than
ever. It's a good thing.
(laughs)
I know I can pull this thing off.

MR. DANIELS
(playfully)
Then what are you doing talking to me?
You've got a lot of work to do. Get to
it!

STEVEN
Thank you. I will.

Hal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, 
JOAN.

STEVEN
I'll be right back.

14A	INT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

Steven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office.

15	OMITTED

16	INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY

ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine." 
Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are 
papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has 
written.

Steven peeks his head in her door.

STEVEN
Hello.

Robin's face drops.

ROBIN
Steven, what are you doing here?

STEVEN
I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop
by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush
article come out?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

ROBIN
They liked it.
(beat)
I thought we agreed we weren't going to
see each other for a month.

STEVEN
I know, it's just Daniels accepted my
proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.

ROBIN
That's wonderful, congratulations.

STEVEN
I know I'm breaking the rules, but come
have dinner with me tonight to celebrate.

ROBIN
I don't think we should.

STEVEN
Come on, this is the biggest day of my
career.

ROBIN
Don't put me in this position.

STEVEN
What position? I want to share this with
you.

ROBIN
(feeling pressured)
I love you, but I need to take some time
on my own to see how I feel. You agreed
to this. I mean this is exactly why we
broke up, because you never listen to me.

STEVE
What? Now we're broken up? What
happened to 'trial separation?'

ROBIN
I can't get into this now. If you haven't
noticed, I'm at work.

STEVE
Sorry to disturb you.

He turns to leave.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

ROBIN
(sincerely)
Steven. Congratulations. I know how
much this means to you. You deserve it.

STEVEN
Thanks.

He leaves.

17	OMITTED

17A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.

Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never 
stopping for more than a second.

He hears a horn honking outside.

CABLE GUY (OS)
Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!

ON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant.

Steven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in 
his window honking the horn.

CABLE GUY
Steven!!!!
(waves)
Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!!

Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the 
television.

ON THE TV - The local news.

REPORTER
Coming up next a special report,
"Loneliness, America's Silent Killer."

Steven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come 
down.

STEVEN
(begins walking to the door)
What the hell.

18	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, "The 
Cable Company - Get Wired Today."

STEVEN
How's it going?

CABLE GUY
Howdy partner. Climb aboard.

Steven gets in.

19	INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van drives onto the main boulevard.

CABLE GUY
Thanks for coming out. You know most
people think cable is just a simple co-ax
that comes out of the wall. They never
take the time to understand how it works.

STEVEN
Where exactly are we goin?

CABLE GUY
We're going to take a ride on the
information superhighway.

20	EXT. CITY - DUSK

Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.

CABLE GUY
It all started in Lansford,
Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.

The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, 
overlooking the entire city.

CABLE GUY
I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable
Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.

21	EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK

Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.

CABLE GUY
I come here to think sometimes. To clear
my head.

They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a 
one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's 
controls are located.

CABLE GUY
There she is. Right now she's sending
entertainment and information to millions
of satisfied citizens.

STEVEN
That's pretty impressive.

CABLE GUY
See, I knew the moment I met you that
you would appreciate this.

The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.

CABLE GUY
(with wonder)
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on
another. You can do your shopping at
home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend
in Vietnam. There's no end to the
possibilities.
(waves to Steven)
Come on up! What are you waiting for?!

22	INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.

CABLE GUY
Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that
there are billions of bits of information
surging through me.

STEVEN
I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I
guess I've always taken it for granted.

CABLE GUY
When I was a kid my mom worked nights.
Never met dad. But the old TV was always
there for me.

STEVEN
I know what you mean. My dad was there,
but he might as well have been gone. My
mom is a stewardess. She was always out
of town.

CABLE GUY
(moved)
That's tough. You must have a lot of
abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father
Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on
Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

STEVEN
(tentative)
You know my brother's a speech therapist.

The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.

CABLE GUY
So?

There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.

STEVEN
Never mind.

The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.

CABLE GUY
(beat)
So, you're pretty love struck about your
lady, huh?

STEVEN
I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and
she asked me to move out.

CABLE GUY
I hate that.

STEVEN
She said she felt pressured. Can you
believe that?

CABLE GUY
Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I
don't think you listen to her. I think
you try to tell her what she wants to
hear. She wants you to thirst for
knowledge about who she is. All the
complicated splendor that is woman. When
your love is truly giving, it will come
back to you ten-fold.

STEVEN
You're right. That is remarkably
insightful.

CABLE GUY
Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final
thought on Friday's show.

23	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.

CABLE GUY
You know what? Women are suckers for
"Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this
month. That's your bait right there.

STEVEN
Robin loves that movie.

CABLE GUY
They all do. Next time you talk to her
tell her you're cooking yourself dinner,
and watching it by yourself. Sound like
you're happier than a pig in shit.
She'll come running. Betcha. Then just
play it cool.

STEVEN
Maybe I will.

Steven gets out of the car.

STEVEN
Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say
this, but I don't know your name. What
is it?

CABLE GUY
(touched)
You really want to know my name? You do?
Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my
friends call me Chip.

STEVEN
I'll see ya' Chip.

Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.

CABLE GUY
Let's just remember right now. You know
some people walk through their entire
lives and never find a true friend.
(long pause)
I guess we're the lucky ones.

(End Revised - Pink)

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.

STEVEN
Uh good-bye.

CABLE GUY
Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the
flip side.

Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.

24	INT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY

Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.

STEVEN
I don't listen to you. I pretend to
understand but I'm really just saying
what I think you want to hear. So from
now on I'm going to try my best to listen
more because I do love you and am
interested in learning about every detail
about the complicated splendor that is
you.

Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.

ROBIN
Oh.

STEVEN
I want us to get back together, but I can
see why taking this time might be good
for us. So, I'm not mad.

After a long beat, Robin smiles.

ROBIN
Sometimes time apart is healthy.

STEVEN
You're right. Well, that's what I came
here to say. Look, I've got to get back
to the office.

He starts getting up.

ROBIN
So, are you doing anything tomorrow?

STEVEN
I'm just going to cook myself dinner and
watch a movie. "Sleepless in Seattle" is
on cable.

ROBIN
Really?

STEVEN
If you're around you should drop by and
check out the new apartment.

ROBIN
Okay, maybe I will.

He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.

ON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news 
update.

TABITHA SOREN
Today in the Sam Sweet case the
prosecution played the 911 call that Sam
Sweet made the night he murdered his
brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one
month later.

The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.

SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE
(crying and babbling)
Hello, please send help. My twin brother
has been shot.

911 OPERATOR
Slow down sir. What happened?

SAM SWEET
Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
four times. I mean I think it was a
shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I
think it was an Asian gang or something.
They were speaking some other language.

Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.

TABITHA SOREN
Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare
interview with Michael Jackson's zoo-
keeper.

25	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, 
but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.

STEVEN
Here, here, here.

A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.

RICK
(to himself)
Shit! My fault! My fault!

STEVEN
Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There
is no stopping me today.

Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who 
catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The 
ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it 
hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the 
Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.

CABLE GUY
Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I
was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd
run the court for a couple of innings.

RICK
(gestures to injured player)
Great. We need another man.

STEVEN
This is Chip Douglas my cable guy.

Rick smiles in recognition.

CABLE GUY
We met about a week ago during a routine
installation, but I feel like I've known
him my whole life.

Steven can't believe this is happening.

RICK
Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip
Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.

CABLE GUY
No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm
skins.

The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he 
is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is 
scary.

JEFF
I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just
play.

CABLE GUY
Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.

The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone 
stares at him until he finishes.

CABLE GUY
Let's get it on!

STEVEN
Are you any good?

CABLE GUY
Feed me under the boards and you'll find
out.

Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as 
humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. 
He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot 
which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.

CABLE GUY
(doing the traveling hand signal)
Traveling! That's traveling!

RICK
Yeah, whatever you say Chip.

Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.

CABLE GUY
All right, so we're playing that type of
game. Prison rules. I get it.

Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss 
crosses all over the court.

CABLE GUY
Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm
open!

Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the 
process. The ball goes in.

CABLE GUY
(does the foul hand signal)
And one! That's definitely a foul!
(to Jeff)
You want to mug me, my wallet is in my
other pants.

STEVEN
(to Cable Guy)
What are you doing?

CABLE GUY
Don't play from fear Steven. We can take
these guys.

MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.

a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it 
down.
b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including 
Rick.
c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. 
The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders 
with Rick.
d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down 
hard.

CABLE GUY
Take it to the hole!

Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs 
his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the 
ground. The ball does not go in.

CABLE GUY
Hey, are you okay?

He pulls Steven up.

STEVEN
Yeah. I'm fine.

CABLE GUY
Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.

The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.

Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to 
the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.

RICK
(enraged)
What the hell was that? That's it. I've
had enough.

Everyone begins to exit the court.

JEFF
Thanks for bringing your "friend".

The Cable Guy runs up to Rick.

CABLE GUY
Good game.
(slaps Rick on the butt)
You were tough out there. Your play
brought me up to a higher level. I mean
that.

RICK
(dismissive)
Yeah.

He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.

STEVEN
What are you doing?

CABLE GUY
It was payback time. I was protecting
you.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

STEVEN
You ruined the game.

CABLE GUY
I don't appreciate your tone Steven.
That's not the way friends speak to each
other.

STEVEN
What are you talking about? I don't even
know you!

CABLE GUY
Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a
Heineken?

STEVEN
No, I'm going home.

Steven turns to leave.

CABLE GUY
Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've
got to go shower up and do some stuff.
I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you
call me or something.

The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the 
cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.

CABLE GUY
And down low.

Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven 
gives him a low five just so he can leave.

CABLE GUY
(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)
Too slow. Have a good one.

STEVEN
(as he walks away)
Yeah, have a good one.

26	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT

Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of 
wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message 
machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

MESSAGE VOICE
You have eleven messages.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
(ON THE MACHINE)
Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm
still your mother.

STEVEN'S FATHER
(ON THE MACHINE)
I'm getting on. Steven call your mother.

CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a
ring. I'm at 555-4329.
(beep)
What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If
you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up.
Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to
you then.

Steven stops chopping.

CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
(beep)
Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when
you get in. I'll be here pretty much all
night. Bye.
(beep tone)
Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a
call when you get a chance.
(beep tone)
I was just taking a whiz, thought you
might have called. Okay later.
(beep tone)
Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to
it, thought it might have been you. All
right, bye.

Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the 
rest of the calls.

CABLE GUY
(fast forwards)
We're having ourselves quite a little
game of phone tag here. You're it!
(fast forwards)
I was just blow drying my hair and I
thought I heard the phone ringing.
(fast forwards)
you're a tough man to reach.
(fast forwards)
I guess you're too busy to call your
friends.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then 

CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
(long beat - then quiet and distant)
Shit.

The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed 
casually, but looks beautiful.

STEVEN
Hey, good to see you.

There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.

STEVEN
Come on in. What do you think of the
place?

She looks at the odd placement of furniture.

ROBIN
You made some interesting choices laying
out the room.

STEVEN
(embarrassed)
That's actually where the movers put the
furniture. I'm gonna change it, very 
soon.

ROBIN
No, I like it.

27	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.

ROBIN
So how's work?

STEVEN
Work's good.

ROBIN
How's Hal?

STEVEN
Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

ROBIN
It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

STEVEN
I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

ROBIN
It's nice to see you doing so well.

STEVEN
Well, it's nice just to see you.
(looks at his watch)
Hey, it should be starting.

They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The 
screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the 
signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.

STEVEN
Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.

ROBIN
It's alright. We can watch it another
night.

STEVEN
No, no. We really should see it now.
Now's a good time.

He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.

STEVEN
Wait, wait. I know what to do.

He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials 
it, then presses the number in.

STEVEN
The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll
just page him. We'll have this fixed in
no time.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing 

THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR

Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and 
disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.

STEVEN
That was fast.

CABLE GUY
Is there a problem with your service?

STEVEN
Yeah my cable went out.

Steven pushes him out into the hall.

CABLE GUY
Really?

The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.

CABLE GUY
So you called me. Interesting how you
call when you need something. Is that how
you treat people?

STEVEN
I've been really busy. You've got to get
my cable going, Robin is here. This is
really important.

He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back 
out.

CABLE GUY
But calling me back isn't?

STEVEN
I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.

CABLE GUY
Why should I help you? I gave you free
cable. What have you ever done for me?

STEVEN
Anything you want. Name it  quickly.

CABLE GUY
Tomorrow night, we hang out.

STEVEN
Fine, whatever you want.

CABLE GUY
God bless you. You're too good to me.

The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.

CABLE GUY
(loud-normally)
All set.

STEVEN
So what's with the cut cord?

CABLE GUY
(nonchalantly)
That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow
Steven.
(conspiratorially)
She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't
even touch her. Fight the urge at all
costs. It will pay off later with

He makes a motion which implies sex.

CABLE GUY
Enjoy the flick.

The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.

ROBIN
Who was that?

STEVEN
Nobody.

Steven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy.

28	ON THE TV

A scene from the film "Sleepless in Seattle."

The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van  alone. 
We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we 
can tell that he lives there.

29	(SCENE 29 OMITTED)

30	EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK

The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.

CABLE GUY
Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of
a weird mood. How'd things go with you?
Keep 'em closed.

STEVEN
Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the
other night. I didn't appreciate you --

CABLE GUY
Don't peek. I want this to be a
surprise.

STEVEN
I really don't need to be surprised.
Where are we going?

CABLE GUY
Only the best restaurant in town.

They walk around a corner.

CABLE GUY
Okay, here we are. Open sesame.

Steven opens his eyes.

The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which 
says "MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT."

STEVEN
Medieval Times?

CABLE GUY
I know what you're thinking. Don't
worry, I'm buying.

31	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER

The Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular 
arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed 
decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc.

(Revision Ends - Pink)

STEVEN
Funny. I never thought I would ever
come here.

CABLE GUY
I love this place. I come here twice a
week.

A Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed.

CABLE GUY
Oh man, that's my look. I love big
butts. Ow, that hurts.

He grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself.

CABLE GUY
There oughta be a law. Man she is hot.
It's just not fair.

STEVEN
(gestures to him squeezing his crotch)
Please don't.

CABLE GUY
You know what I need right now? Pooooon
tang. And I'm not talking about the
place in Vietnam.

STEVEN
Good to know.

They sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not 
enthusiastic about her job.

WAITRESS
(flatly)
Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is
Melinda. I'll be your serving wench.
May I get you something from the bar
keep?

CABLE GUY
(too into it)
Dost thou have a mug of ale for me
and me mate? He has been pitched in
battle for a fortnight an has a King's
thirst for the beer thust thou might have
for thust.

WAITRESS
(uninspired)
I'll be right back my lord.

The Cable Guy puts something together.

CABLE GUY
There you go.

He hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on.

STEVEN
Thanks for the help.

The Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen.

CABLE GUY
Steven, don't turn around, but there is a
woman eyeing you like you are a piece of
meat and she hasn't eaten in a week.

Steven acts like he isn't interested, but he is.

STEVEN
Really? What does she look like?

CABLE GUY
Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking
me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total
robo-babe.

STEVEN
Are you serious?

CABLE GUY
Don't look.

STEVEN
I've got to look.

CABLE GUY
Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like
you are looking for the waitress.

Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She 
is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the 
cable Guy, annoyed.

CABLE GUY
Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind.
But you fell for it man. You are one
horny Indian Chief.

STEVEN
(not laughing)
You got me.

CABLE GUY
So what did you want to rap about?

The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins.

CABLE GUY
Hold that thought. Show's on.

The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena.

32	ON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN "ROBIN 
HOOD" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD

HOST
Welcome to a magnificent journey into the
past. This is Medieval Times!

The entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds.

HOST
Are you prepapred for a night of feasting
and sport the likes of which ye will
never forget?!

The audience applauds.

HOST
I charge you to stand up on your feet and
cheer for your section's knight!

ON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. 
The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated.

CABLE GUY
Let the games begin! The Red Knight
rules! Blue Knight! You're going down!
Going down!

An embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down.

33	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER

ON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on 
horseback.

ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands 
while watching the show.

STEVEN
(to the Watiress)
Could I get a knife and fork?

WAITRESS
There were no utensils in Medieval Times,
so there are no utensils at 'Medieval
Times.' Do you want a refill on that
Pepsi?

STEVEN
There were no utensils, but there was
Pepsi?

WAITRESS
Look, I have a lot of tables to get to.

The waitress exits.

CABLE GUY
(stands up - yells to the competitors)
Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no
mercy!

The two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins.

The crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy.

CABLE GUY
(to Steven)
Come on, get into it, we won!

Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds.

STEVEN
(halfheartedly)
Way to go Red Knight. Good job of
killing. Good work.

Steven and the Cable Guy sit down.

CABLE GUY
So, what were you saying before?

STEVEN
(tentatively)
How do I put this? I've really enjoyed
hanging out with you, but...

CABLE GUY
That's why I became a cable guy. To make
friends like you. Every time I walk up to
a new door, that door is a possibility
for friendship. When I walked in your
apartment I knew there was something
there. I just knew it.

STEVEN
(sotto)
Oh lord.
(tries to get back on track)
I want you to know --

The lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting 
Steven.

HOST
We have reached the climax of our
competition good people! Now, two noble
men from our audience will battle to the
death to resolve a grievance. Will a
Master...
(looks at his clipboard)
Steven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie
Douglas make you way to the fighting
pit!

A spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked.

STEVEN
What's going on?

CABLE GUY
We're going to do battle. It'll be fun.

STEVEN
Is this a normal part of the show?

CABLE GUY
No, but I give all the Knights free
cable. They said it would be cool if we
just went at it for a little while.

Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away.

STEVEN
Is this safe?

CABLE GUY
That's what the armor's for.

34	INT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER

Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not 
be happier. Steven is freaked out.

STEVEN
What are we supposed to do? We've got to
be careful we don't hurt each other.

The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.

CABLE GUY
I cannot listen to any of your
instructions for you are my sworn enemy,
and are about to meet your demise.

Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.

HOST
Let the battle begin. Come now people,
let me hear your voices!

The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to 
the center of the pit.

The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven 
mirrors him, not sure of what to do.

STEVEN
Just take it easy.

The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. 
The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and 
pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his 
shield.

STEVEN
(enraged)
What are you doing?!

CABLE GUY
(matter of fact)
I'm trying to kill you.

The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled 
wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.

STEVEN
Hey, watch it!

The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the 
ground.

CABLE GUY
This is just like when Spock had to fight
Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced
to do battle.

Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his 
sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.

CABLE GUY
That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good
show.

Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the 
Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on 
the ground.

By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.

CABLE GUY
So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All
right. If you want to play rought, Daddy
can play rough.

The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, 
sending him to the ground.

The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy 
silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar 
weapon, and then begin to circle each other.

STEVEN
Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop
it!

CABLE GUY
The name is Spock. If we don't battle to
the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye
Jim.

He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek 
Battle Music" as they fight.

STEVEN
This isn't 'Star Trek!'

MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC

They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes 
Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The 
Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing 
and roll in a vicious battle.

Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part 
of Steven's protection.
STEVEN
(looking down)
Jesus.

The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of 
pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting 
stick.

The show's host runs up to Steven.

HOST
Quickly, muster a top your steed.
(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)
Get on the god damn horse! I don't think
he's kidding!

Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse 
sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.
STEVEN
Don't do this!
CABLE GUY
Jim, we have no choice!
STEVEN
Oh my god.

They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one 
another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.
The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, 
throws off his helmet.
STEVEN
(concerned)
Are you okay?

The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.
CABLE GUY
Well done good sir. You are the victor,
but we shall meet again.

The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the 
arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms 
in triumph, and smiles.
DISSOLVE TO LATER:
35	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
They are walking up the stairs.
CABLE GUY
You've got a real warrior's instinct.
STEVEN
I've got to admit there's a real feeling
of power holding that jousting stick.
CABLE GUY
If Robin saw you tonight, she would be
begging you to take her back. I'm
telling you these knights get laid all
the time.
STEVEN
We should go again next week.
CABLE GUY
Easy there Lancelot.

Steven opens the door to his apartment.
36	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine.
MACHINE
You have zero messages.
CABLE GUY
Nobody loves ya.
(grabs a beer from the fridge)
Hey, I think I left my staple gun in the
living room the other day. Could you be
a pal?

Steven walks to the living room.
36AA	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Steven turns on the lights.
CABLE GUY
What do you think?

Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc 
player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line.
STEVEN
What is this?
CABLE GUY
I took the liberty of updating your in
home entertainment system. I got you the
big screen, plus THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his
pants.
STEVEN
You went in my house when I wasn't home?
CABLE GUY
How else was I supposed to get the stuff
in here? Magic?
STEVEN
How much did this cost?
CABLE GUY
Practically nothing. I have a connection.
Preferred customer. I hook him up, he
hooks me up.
STEVEN
Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't
feel right.
CABLE GUY
Yes but you give me something so much
more valuable friendship.
STEVEN
And you've given me friendship, so we're
even.
(beat)
Really, don't take it personally, but
you've got to take it back.
CABLE GUY
(sadly)
Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck
works all week. Is it all right if I
leave it here till Saturday?
STEVEN
(guilty)
Sure, no problem. And don't get me
wrong. I really appreciate the gesture.
CABLE GUY
Mm-hmm.
(beat)
Staple gun?
STEVEN
Oh, right.

Steven picks up the staple gun. The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch. Steven drops the staple 
gun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it.
36A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads "HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A 
WONDERFUL DAY."
STEVEN
(into the phone)
Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still
trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work.
Call me.

He hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not 
enter.
MR. DANIELS
How's it going?
STEVEN
Good.
MR. DANIELS
(long beat)
Good good?
STEVEN
Great.
MR. DANIELS
Good. Keep it up.

He leaves. The phone rings.
SECRETARY
(through the intercom)
Robin on line two.

Steven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone.
STEVEN
Hey, I had the best time the other night.
When am I going to get you on my couch
again?

36B	INT. VAN - DAY
The Cable Guy is driving around. He speaks on a cellular phone.
CABLE GUY
Well tonight's not looking too good. How
about tomorrow?
STEVEN
Chip?
CABLE GUY
I knew I'd get you on the phone that way.
Listen, that equipment will be history
the day after tomorrow. It sure would be
a pity to leave that karaoke machine a
virgin.
STEVEN
What do you mean?
CABLE GUY
Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke
jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a
few butts. Later gator.

37	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SATURDAY NIGHT
CLOSE UP - AN OLD MAN'S FACE INTENSELY SINGING "AMERICAN WOMAN."
We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room. It is populated with about twenty odd 
looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very 
uncomfortable.
37AA	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Steven is on the phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the 
fridge.
STEVEN
Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my
message?

37A	INT. - ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT
The scene intercuts between the two locations. Robin is dressed up, and on her way out.
ROBIN
Yes. You left me five messages. It king
of freaked me out.
STEVEN
Sorry. I've been trying to reach you
'cause I'm having a party.
You've got to come over.
ROBIN
(listens for a beat)
I can't. I'm going to dinner with
someone.
STEVEN
Dinner? What, like a date?
ROBIN
Not really a date.
STEVEN
You've got a date?! I thought things
were going well between us.
ROBIN
They are.
STEVEN
So why are you going out on a date?
ROBIN
I made it before we got together the
other night. I knew you would freak out.
STEVEN
I'm not freaking out.
ROBIN
Yes, you are freaking out.
STEVEN
I'm not. I just can't believe you would
do this.
ROBIN
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed
to date. It's not like we're back
together. We had a good time the other
night, and you're already pressuring me.
STEVEN
(pissy)
Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun.
ROBIN
I will.
STEVEN
Fine. Bye.

Steven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer.
CABLE GUY
This is just a sign that you need to live
a little. She's having fun, and you
should too.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
STEVEN
You're probably right.
CABLE GUY
Damn right I'm right.
STEVEN
Oh, I got you a little something.

He hands a box to the Cable Guy.
CABLE GUY
I thought you said we were even. You're
breaking the rules.
STEVEN
So shoot me.

He opens it. The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days." The Cable Guy is so moved he 
cannot speak.
STEVEN
My brother said it might help with your
lisp.

The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard.
CABLE GUY
Words cannot express
(he is too moved to finish his sentence)
STEVEN
It's no big deal.
CABLE GUY
Yes it is.

He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable.
CABLE GUY
Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be
the best party ever! Let's rock.

37B	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
They walk into the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing "Superfreak." Everyone's 
having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
STEVEN
You've got plenty of friends.
CABLE GUY
These people are acquaintances. They're
not ride to the airport friends, like us.
(sees something)
Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A
real barn burner. Don't look.
STEVEN
You're playing with me again.
CABLE GUY
No sirree Steven. This woman is all over
you like a lamp-shade.
STEVEN
Shut up.

He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. 
When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back.
CABLE GUY
Did it just get hotter in here?
(grabs his crotch)
Oh, that hurts.
STEVEN
Who'd she come with?
CABLE GUY
I don't know, but she looks pretty
available to me. I'd strike while the
iron is hot. He who hesitates,
masturbates, know what I'm saying?

ANGLE ON
A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick.
ODD MAN
He sure can throw a party. Chip's an
incredible man. I really admire him.
RICK
Where do you know him from?
ODD MAN
He hooked up my cable. Didn't charge me
either. That's the kind of guy he is.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
ANGLE ON
Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman.
STEVEN
Hey. I'm Steven.
WOMAN
Heather.
STEVEN
Can I get you something to drink?
HEATHER
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila if you
will.
STEVEN
Coming right up.

37C	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
AT THE KARAOKE AREA - Steven and Heather are singing "You're the One that I Want" from 
"Grease." They are both drunk, and having a great time.
The Cable Guy walks over to Rick.
CABLE GUY
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.
RICK
Steven invited me.

The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather.
CABLE GUY
Look at him. Have you ever seen him so
alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got
to learn to live with that.
RICK
I don't know what your story is "Chip
Douglas," but I'm going to find out.
CABLE GUY
Oooh. How dramatic.

The song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him.
RICK
I'm getting out of here.
STEVEN
(drunk)
Why? This is a great party. This girl
is really into me.
RICK
You're whacked man. That guy is bad
news.
STEVEN
You don't even know him. You're just mad
'cause he kicked your ass in basketball.
RICK
I can't even deal. I'm outta here.

ON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone.

CABLE GUY
Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to
thank Steven for being such a terific
host.

Steven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud.

CABLE GUY
Don't forget to kick in some spinach for
the beer. Steven ain't made of money.
And I expect some of you to join in the
clean up crew.

OFF DUTY COP
Sing something! Do a song!

CABLE GUY
(false coyness)
No I really couldn't.

ODD MAN
Come on! Do your song!

CABLE GUY
Okay, just to stop that guy from begging.
This number is dedicated to all of the
ladies in the house.

He puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song "Bust A 
Move," accompanied by elaborate dance moves.

CABLE GUY
(rapping)
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

During the musical break the Cable Guy begins to break dance. He knows all the moves. The 
robot, the spider, the crab. He looks like a deranged cast member or "Electric Boogaloo." The 
guests go crazy.

ANGLE ON STEVEN AND HEATHER

STEVEN
You sounded just like Olivia Newton John.

HEATHER
I've been practicing for years.

STEVEN
(laughs)
So what do you do?

HEATHER
I can barely hear you. Do you want to
talk in the other room?

STEVEN
Oh okay.

They walk into Steven's bedroom.

ON THE CABLE GUY

CABLE GUY
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

38	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Heather are sitting on the bed talking.

STEVEN
She says she wants a break, and that's
fine with me. I think I needed some time
also.

HEATHER
Yeah. I know what you mean.

She leans in and kisses him.

39	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The cable Guy has got all of the guests in a frenzy.

CABLE GUY
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

40	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Heather are kissing passionately. Suddenly the door flies open, and the Cable Guy 
dances into the room, takes out a Polaroid instamatic camera and FLASHES A PICTURE of 
them. Steven is disoriented. Behind the Cable Guy in the hallway is everyone from the party.

CABLE GUY
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

He continues to rap, dance and flash pictures of everyone as he dances out of the room.

41	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

Steven walks into the living room looking a little disheveled. The Cable Guy is cooking him 
breakfast.

CABLE GUY
Good morning sleepy head. I hope you
don't mind, I crashed on the couch.
Bacon and eggs coming up.

STEVEN
Where did Heather go?

CABLE GUY
I heard her slip out early this morning.

STEVEN
What a night. That was just what I
needed.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

CABLE GUY
You look like a new man.

STEVEN
I feel like a new man. I was getting so
used to being rejected. I really liked
her.

CABLE GUY
Hey, it was my treat.

STEVEN
(taken aback)
What do you mean it was "your treat?"

CABLE GUY
You know, I bought this time, you buy
next time.

STEVEN
(getting concerned)
Buy what?

CABLE GUY
You know, the women.

STEVEN
You mean Heather is a prostitute?

CABLE GUY
Of course she is. Do you think a woman
like that would hang out with us if we
weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't
know.

STEVEN
I can't believe this.

He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain.

CABLE GUY
She's clean I assure you. I tried her out
last week to make sure she was top
quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not
a drip. She's the best, ask any of my
friends.

Steven cringes.

STEVE
You've got to be kidding? Please tell me
she's a friend of yours. You're just
playing with my mind again, right?

CABLE GUY
I wish I had friends like that.

STEVEN
Get out of my house!

CABLE GUY
Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she
was a working girl, but she kind of liked
you. You might have been able to
get a freebie.

STEVEN
Out, now! I don't ever want to see you
again.
(to himself)
Robin is never going to forgive me.

CABLE GUY
I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't
tell her. You want to get her back, I'll
help you get her back.

STEVEN
I don't want your help. I want you to
leave.
(gestures to the TV)
And take that stuff out of here.

CABLE GUY
(calmly)
Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see
ya'.

The Cable Guy exits.

42	OMITTED

43	EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

P.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant.

We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A 
moment later he heads inside.

44	INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Cable Guy enters the restaurant. The HOSTESS walks over to him.

HOSTESS
May I help you?

CABLE GUY
No, I'm meeting someone here.

He looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They 
are on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom.

45	INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

An OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a 
variety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper 
towels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits.

BATHROOM ATTENDANT
Most appreciated.

The Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar 
bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose.

CABLE GUY
You've been working hard. Take a break.

46	INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER

Robin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad 
plates in front of them.

RAY
My brother and I wanna start our own sun
block company. But the twist is, it's
only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki.
We haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki.
Do you think that sounds good?

ROBIN
BlockSki? That sounds right.

RAY
So, Gail told me you're just coming off a
relationship.

ROBIN
Well, not really. We're kind of in a
holding pattern. He wants more of a
commitment, but I don't think I'm ready.
I just want to have a good time for a
while.

RAY
Then we got to get you on a Skidoo!

ROBIN
Skidoo?

RAY
High powered snow mobile. It'll blow
your mind. It flies over powder like
it's glass.

Their waitress passes by.

RAY
(impatiently)
Hey, how are you doing on that chicken?
Have the eggs hatched yet? Thanks.

Robin is mortified by his behavior.

RAY
So, how's your work going?

ROBIN
It's been crazy. They just hired a 

RAY
Hold that thought. I have to use the rest
room. Be right back.

He leaves. Robin looks relieved to have a break.

47	INT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ray enters the restroom. The Cable Guy is now wearing the bathroom attendant's blue shirt white 
pants and a thin fake moustache. A DISTINGUISHED MAN walks over and washes his hands.

MAN
(to Cable guy)
Towel please.

CABLE GUY
My pleasure.

The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he 
grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them 
furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're 
dry. The man is aghast.

CABLE GUY
Enjoy your meal

The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls.

CABLE GUY
Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't
it?

RAY
(curt)
Yeah.

CABLE GUY
But I guess the weather's always pleasant
in here. The winters are remarkably mild.

He laughs at his own joke. Ray walks into the handicapped stall.

CABLE GUY (OS)
If you need anything, just let me know.
Anything at all.

RAY
(getting annoyed)
I think I can handle it.

Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy 
is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him.

CABLE GUY
I'm here to serve you.

RAY
Jesus! Get out of here!

CABLE GUY
Most people never bother to take
advantage of all my services, for
instance 

The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face 
into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong.

CABLE GUY
I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is
so very important.

He pulls his face out.
CABLE GUY
Then once you're done I have a variety of
skin care products which can make you
look years younger.

The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion.

CABLE GUY
This lotion is superb at removing liver
spots.

He slaps it onto Ray's face.

CABLE GUY
This one is an excellent moisturizer.

The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's 
about to put it on Ray's face.

CABLE GUY
And one can never underestimate the
effects of a good cologne.

The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face.

CABLE GUY
(sniffs)
Mm High Karate. And now a touch of
powder.

He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him.

CABLE GUY
(grabs a tweezer)
Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very
important to be properly tweezed.

The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows.

CABLE GUY
You're on a big date, you'll need fresh
breath.

He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth.

CABLE GUY
Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that
reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.

The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.

CABLE GUY
Looking good, now let's dry you off.

He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable 
Guy puts his face right up next to the air.

CABLE GUY
Now suck it. Suck the air!

Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut 
experiencing heavy G-Force.

CABLE GUY
from this angle you look just like Neil
Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I
believe you have the "right stuff."

The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.

CABLE GUY
Don't worry about the tip. But I've got
one for you.
(whispers into his ear)
Stay away from Robin. She's taken.

He tosses him out the door.

47A	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

The door opens, and Ray falls to the floor.

47B	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Robin sits alone at her table. She looks at her watch. In the background the Cable Guy slips out.

48	OMITTED

49	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven is watching television while eating a TV dinner.

ON THE TV - LOCAL TELEVISION NEWS

ANCHOR MAN
Here's a bizarre story from downtown,
where a man was beaten in a restroom by
an assailant disguised as a bathroom
attendant. The victim has been unable to
speak since the unmotivated attack.

We see the image of a shaken up RAY being led out of the restaurant by two police officers.

ANCHOR MAN
A police sketch artist put together this
drawing from witnesses' descriptions.

We see a drawing which looks a little like the Cable Guy. In it he has a moustache and appears to 
be Hispanic. Steven looks carefully. Does he know that man? Nah. He changes the channel.

ON THE TV - the FOX logo flies up, followed by a slick promo for a FOX Movie-of-the-Week 
on the Sam Sweet trial.

ANOUNCER (V.O.)
Tonight on Fox, the true story behind the
trial that's captured the nation.

We see ERIC ROBERTS holding a shotgun, pointed at another scared ERIC ROBERTS.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The jury may still be out, but the
chilling facts are in. Eric Roberts, in
his dramatic debut is Sam and Stan Sweet.
"Brother, Sweet Brother: The Killing of
Stanton Sweet." Tonight on Fox.

49A	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The Cable Guy walks over to a FEMALE NEIGHBOR.

CABLE GUY
Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris?

FEMALE NEIGHBOR
(points)
It's right upstairs.

50	INT. ROBIN'S HOME - NEXT DAY

There is a LOUD KNOCK. Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain.

ROBIN
Who is it?

The Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible.

CABLE GUY
It's the Cable Guy.

ROBIN
There's no problem with my cable.

CABLE GUY
I've got an upgrade order for one Robin
Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every
pay channel available.

ROBIN
I didn't order this.

CABLE GUY
Apparently you've got a secret admirer.

She unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside.

ROBIN
Was it a man named Steven?

CABLE GUY
I can't tell you.

ROBIN
Come on.

CABLE GUY
No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say.

He gave it away on purpose. They both laugh.

CABLE GUY
Whoops, I slipped. Well you didn't hear
it from me.

51	INT. AIR DUCT - LATER

The Cable Guy is in the air duct. He is pulling cord. He reaches an area of the duct which opens 
up to a vent. He looks through and sees Robin changing in the bedroom. He tries not to look at 
Robin undress. He turns away.

CABLE GUY
I'm sorry Steven. I'm just a man.

He turns back and looks at her. He notices a birthmark on her back.

52	INT. APARTMENT - LATER

The Cable Guy is on his way out.

CABLE GUY
That about does it. Enjoy.

ROBIN
So, are you a friend of Steven's?

CABLE GUY
I'm proud to say I am. I installed his
cable recently, and we just hit it off.

ROBIN
That's right. You fixed his cable the
other night.
(suspicious)
So you guys are going out a lot?

CABLE GUY
Not really. That man is devoted to you.
You know I'm probably crossing a boundary
telling you this, but he's really crazy
about you.

ROBIN
Did he say that?

CABLE GUY
Only every five minutes. Quite frankly,
I'm sick of hearing it. No, I'm just
kidding with you.
(looks her deeply in the eyes)
He's a good man. He mentioned that you
guys have had some problems.

ROBIN
Well, it's a little complicated.

CABLE GUY
It always is. You know I asked a woman to
marry me once. She said she wanted to
think about it. We agreed to take some
time apart to re-assess our feelings. To
give each other
(mockingly)
space.
(chokes up)
Well, she is no longer with us.

ROBIN
I'm so sorry.

CABLE GUY
Sometimes you don't have the time you
think you have. Just promise me you'll
never go bungee jumping in Mexico.

ROBIN
I promise.

CABLE GUY
(embarrassed that he spoke too much)
Anyway, I've got to go.

He quickly departs. We hold on Robin for a beat.

53	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The Cable Guy smiles, proud of himself.

53A	EXT. RENOVATION SITE - DUSK

Establishing shot of the building. We hear Steven's cellular phone ring.

53B	INT. RENOVATION SITE - DUSK - INTERCUT

Steven holds on a cellular phone as he walks down the long Gothic hallway of a half renovated 
school house. Around him construction workers go about their business.

STEVEN
Hello?

ROBIN (VO)
I love you.

STEVEN
Robin?

54	INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

Robin is on the phone.

ROBIN
Yes.

STEVEN
(surprised)
I love you too.

ROBIN
That was so sweet of you.

STEVEN
(playing along)
Oh well

ROBIN
You didn't have to do that.

STEVEN
I wanted to.

ROBIN
Giving me free cable. Only you would do
that.

STEVEN
You got it? Great.

ROBIN
Yes, your friend came by.

STEVEN
My friend?

ROBIN
The Cable Guy. I liked him. He was kind
of goofy, but nice. Thank you so much
for doing that.

STEVEN
I'm glad you liked it. I've wanted to
do something nice for you, but I've been
trying to give you your space.

ROBIN
Well, I don't think we should make rules
anymore.

STEVE
Okay.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

ROBIN
Call me later if you're around?

STEVEN
Sure. I'll call you as son as I get
home. Bye.

Steven is elated. He can barely contain himself.

RICK (O.S.)
Steven, are you ready to go?

Steven turns and sees Rick wearing a "Soundgarden" T-shirt.

STEVEN
(pained)
The concert. Oh Jesus.

RICK
What?

STEVEN
Robin just called. I think we're getting
back together.

RICK
(pissed)
So you're blowing me off? I can't
believe this.

STEVEN
This is the first time she asked to get
back together.

RICK
You do this every time. You only call me
after a girl breaks your heart. "Oh Rick
can I stay on your couch? Let's talk all
night about how mean girls are." Then as
soon as a relationship starts again
it's bye-bye Rick. I don't know why I
fall for it anymore.

55	OMITTED

56	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is raining. Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off.

STEVEN
Can't you get someone else
to go?

(Revision Ends - Blue)

RICK
Maybe I'll take MY cable guy.

Steven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable 
Guy appears from behind a corner.

CABLE GUY
Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you
knock 'em down.

STEVEN
What?

CABLE GUY
Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced
her up.

STEVEN
How do you know we're back together?

CABLE GUY
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

STEVEN
I don't want you messing around with my
life. You've caused enough trouble as it
is.

CABLE GUY
I know. I felt bad about the other night,
so I wanted to make it up to you. So
what are you doing? Do you want to catch
a bite?

Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye.

STEVEN
(sincerely yet curt)
Look, I appreciate you helping me out
with Robin. But you have to understand,
I'm going to have to work extra hard to
not screw this relationship up again.
You're a great guy, but I just don't have
any room in my life for a new friend. Do
you understand?

CABLE GUY
I appreciate your honesty. You're a real
straight shooter.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

STEVEN
So, you're okay?

CABLE GUY
Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal.
Whatever.

STEVEN
All right well, take care.

CABLE GUY
Have a good one.

The Cable Guy walks away. Steven stands there feeling a little guilty about what he just did. 
MUSIC UP.

57	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ON THE TV - Conan O'Brien is doing a monologue joke about Sam Sweet.

Steven and Robin are kissing. Outside it is raining. There is occasional lightning and thunder. In 
the middle of kissing, lightning flashes. Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring 
down at them, his faced pressed against the skylight. In the next flash he is gone. Was it real? 
Steven looks scared.

ROBIN
Are you alright?

STEVEN
I'm fine.

They go back to kissing.

57A	EXT. TELEPHONE POLE/INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE - DAY

The Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly 
pull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a 
phone company employee. He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the 
telephone pole.

CABLE GUY
Hey, it's Chip Douglas.

ROBIN
Chip Douglas?

CABLE GUY
Your cable guy.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

ROBIN
(surprised to hear from him)
Oh, hi. What's up?

CABLE GUY
I feel kind of weird calling you. It's
just I'm worried about Steven.

ROBIN
What is it?

CABLE GUY
Something isn't right. He hasn't been
himself lately. Have you noticed
anything?

ROBIN
No, things are actually going really
well.

CABLE GUY
Good.

ROBIN
Should I be worried?

CABLE GUY
Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous
nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open.

ROBIN
(nervous)
I will. Good-bye.

She hangs up, then dials Steven's number.

ROBIN
Steven Bartowsky please.

57B	INT. STEVEN'S SECRETARY'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

His secretary, JOAN, answers the phone.

JOAN
Sorry Robin. He's in a meeting.

58	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting. Steven 
listens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group.

SALES MANAGER
The response to our initial offering has
been remarkable. A local investment
group has decided to buy the entire
complex and turn them into rentals. In
retrospect I must admit we made one big
mistake.

Everyone hangs on his every word.

SALES MANAGER
We should have asked for more money.

The entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up.

MR. DANIELS
I just want to put this out there,
Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your
cajones, and mine, out on the table, and
you slam dunked it. Way to go.
(nervously jokes)
Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs
ahead of me. All right, in other
business

As Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door.

JOAN
(quietly)
Pssst. Steven.

Steven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.

JOAN
(more urgently-quietly)
I really need to speak with you.

Some people are beginning to notice this exchange.

STEVEN
(curtly)
It can wait.

Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking 
concerned.

POLICE OFFICER
Is there a Steven Bartowsky here?

STEVEN
Uh I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going
on?

POLICE OFFICER
You are under arrest.

MR. DANIELS
On what charge?

POLICE OFFICER
Receipt of stolen merchandise.

STEVEN
What? I never 

POLICE OFFICER
Please put our hands on the table.

Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his 
club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain.

POLICE OFFICER
Please follow my instructions. Hands
on the table.

Steven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of 
everyone. It is pure humiliation.

POLICE OFFICER
Hands behind your back.

The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around.

POLICE OFFICER #2
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you
in a court of law. You have the right to
an attorney. If you cannot afford an
attorney one will be provided for you.
Do you understand?

STEVE
This is all a mistake. I didn't accept
any stolen goods.

Just then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head.

CABLE GUY (V.O.)
(with echo)
you're getting THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his
pants  cream in his pants.

He pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He 
tries to break the tension with a joke.

STEVEN
Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to
jail.

Nobody laughs. He exits.

59	EXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside.

We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. 
Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly 
watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable 
guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.

60	INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

Steven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his 
LAWYER.

EARL
I can't believe you did this.

STEVEN
I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave
me all that stuff as a present.

EARL
A stereo system and a big screen TV as a
present? You expect me to believe that?
You know you're killing your mother with
this.

STEVEN
I swear it's true.

EARL
Why would you accept such extravagant
gifts?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

STEVEN
I don't know. I shouldn't have.

EARL
What is really going on here Steven? Are
you on something?

STEVEN
I'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please
call my cable guy, his name is Ernie
Douglas.

LAWYER
Steven, the police looked into it, nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable
Company.'

EARL
You want to tell us the truth now

STEVEN
(falling apart)
That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this
is not happening.

EARL
Yes it is, and it's killing your mother.
Did you deliberately want to ruin our
fortieth anniversary party on Monday,
Steven?

STEVEN
Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan.
(to the lawyer)
When can you get me out of here?

LAWYER
Unfortunately it's too late to get a bail
hearing today. You're going to have to
spend the weekend in county lock up.

STEVEN
The entire weekend?

61	OMITTED

(Revision Ends - Blue)

62	INT. PRISON - LATER

Steven is now wearing prison blues. He holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the 
long corridor to his cell. Lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at 
Steven, and taunt him as he walks by. It is a nightmare.

PRISONER #1
New meat! Look at the pretty boy!

PRISONER #2
Nobody touches him, he's mine! You touch
him, you're dead!

PRISONER #3
Is baby scared? Don't cry baby!

They all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell. A guard opens the door. Steven enters 
his cell. He turns and inside is an angry looking prisoner. The door is locked behind him.

ANGRY PRISONER
Ooh, looks like I won the lottery.

63	OMITTED

64	INT. VISITORS ROOM - MORNING

A guard walks Steven in. His lawyer sits on the other side of the glass with his back to Steven. 
Steven sits down and picks up the phone, excited to hear any news.

STEVEN
What did you hear? What did you hear?

The man turns around. It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the
Cable Guy dressed in an expensive suit.

CABLE GUY
Hello Steven. I came as soon as I heard.

Steven's head sinks.

STEVEN
Who are you?! What's your real name?!

CABLE GUY
So many questions.

STEVEN
Why are you doing this to me?

CABLE GUY
I didn't do this to you, you did this to
you. You need to learn who your friends
are.

STEVEN
You set me up.

CABLE GUY
I taught you a lesson. I can be your best
friend, or your worst enemy. I hope
you'll choose the latter I mean, the
former. You know what I mean.

STEVEN
I'll never be your friend. You need help.

The Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive.

CABLE GUY
Right now I think you're the one who
needs help. I'm here to give you comfort.

The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass.

CABLE GUY
Come on, touch it.

Steven just stares at him.

CABLE GUY
Come on. You need human contact. Touch
it.

STEVEN
I will not touch it.

The Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt.

STEVEN
What are you doing? Stop it.

Steven looks around frantically.

CABLE GUY
I know how you're feeling right now.

The Cable Guy pushes his naked breast against the glass. Other prisoners are beginning to stare.

STEVEN
(smacking the glass)
Stop it! Stop it!

CABLE GUY
I'm here for you.

STEVEN
(smacks the glass three times)
Get off there! Are you trying to get me
killed?

The Cable Guy begins to laugh.

CABLE GUY
(as he buttons his shirt)
I was just messing with your mind. That
was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome
film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award
for the screenplay.

STEVEN
Guard! Guard!

CABLE GUY
Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make
sure she's well taken care of.

STEVEN
You go near her, I'll kill you.

Steven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit.

STEVEN
Hey, this is the guy who framed me!

The Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door.

CABLE GUY
(warmly)
Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on
Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun
when it's Free Per View.

They both laugh. The door closes behind them.

65	EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DAY

The Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman. People look at him funny as he speaks out 
loud to his lisp tape.

(Revision 11/13/95 - Blue)

CABLE GUY
(over-pronouncing)
Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon.
Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious.
Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational.

Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands 
up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her.

ROBIN
Hello.

CABLE GUY
Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under
these circumstances.

ROBIN
Me too. Believe me.

CABLE GUY
I know we don't know each other very
well, but we do have one thing in common, 
our concern for Steven.

ROBIN
Well, you were right. Something's
happening with him and he won't even
acknowledge it.

CABLE GUY
If he refuses to admit he has a problem,
we may have to let him hit bottom. He's
gonna need some tough love.

ROBIN
(tentatively)
You know his lawyer said that nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable
Company.

CABLE GUY
(chuckles)
Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work
under a pseudonym so the customers won't
harass me at home. Kind of like a
stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry
Tate.

ROBIN
And he's saying he received all the
stereo equipment from you.

CABLE GUY
(I know, and I'm not mad. He's been
cornered, so he's telling some wives
tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.

ROBIN
I just feel like I triggered this with
him. It's not that I don't want to get
married, it's just I felt like he wanted
to get married just to get married. I
don't deal well with pressure.

CABLE GUY
Hey, welcome to the human race. We're
not perfect. We all think we have to
look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as
witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a
break.

ROBIN
God I could go for turkey and mashed
potatoes now.

CABLE GUY
Comfort food. Bring it on.

ROBIN
Exactly.

She laughs.

CABLE GUY
You've got a great laugh. Can I make a
small request? I'd like to hear it a little
more often.

She blushes.

66	INT. PRISON ADMINISTRATION - NEXT DAY

ON THE TV - Hard Copy's BARRY NOLAN, sits behind his desk giving a news update.

BARRY NOLAN
The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into
chaos as a result of a videotape made a
month after the killing. In this "Hard
Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated
Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his
friends at a party. The judge has not
decided whether this tape is admissible
as evidence.

We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands 
next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer 
bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror.

SAM SWEET
(to camera)
Hey everyone. Look it's me and
(gestures to his reflection)
my brother Stan.
(waves at reflection)
Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How
are you feeling?
(to camera)
Look, he's alive.

Sam punches the mirror, shattering it.

SAM SWEET
(angry)
Now he's dead.

Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile.

SAM SWEET
What? I'm just goofing around.

We pull back and reveal a group of police officers watching this on television.

We pan over to Steven's father EARL paying bail.

STEVEN
I'm sorry dad.

EARL
I don't want to hear it. Do you know the
pain you out your mother through? You're
lucky she didn't die of a heart attack.

STEVEN
I didn't do anything.

EARL
Just like you said you didn't steal that
'X-Men' comic book when you were eight.
Then I found it in your underwear drawer.

STEVEN
Will you ever stop mentioning that?

EARL
This cost me a lot of money. You jump
bail, and I swear I'll hire a bounty
hunter to hunt you down.

67	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Steven walks into his apartment, exhausted from his jail experience. He walks into the living room 
and sees several new frames on the wall. They are four foot blow ups of Polaroid photographs of 
Steven with his arm around the Cable Guy at the karaoke jam. The photos have been tinted in a 
stylish fashion.

Steven angrily runs to the wall and takes them down.

68	OMITTED

69	EXT. STEVEN'S PARENTS' HOME - NIGHT

Steven and Robin are walking up the stairs to the front door. They are dressed up for his parents' 
anniversary party.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

ROBIN
Are you sure you're okay?

STEVEN
I'm fine.

ROBIN
You're not fine. When you say you're
fine, I know you're not fine.

STEVEN
I just want to get this over with so I
can go home and get some rest.

ROBIN
I wanted you to know I invited your
friend. He was concerned about you.

STEVEN
Great. I feel. Bad. I've been kind of
blowing Rick off lately.

He rings the doorbell.

ROBIN
Not Rick.

The door opens. Standing there, dressed to kill, is the Cable Guy.

CABLE GUY
You can only come in if you came to rage.

Steven is shocked. Robin walks in. When Steven walks in, the Cable Guy stops him.

CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
Is this guy cool?
(to Steven)
I'm just joshing. Come on in.

They walk inside.

70	INT. STEVEN'S FATHER'S HOME

Steven turns to Robin.

STEVEN
(enraged)
What is he doing here?

ROBIN
I invited him.

STEVEN
When did you invite him?

ROBIN
At lunch the other day.

STEVEN
At lunch? You had lunch with him?

The Cable Guy walks over.

ROBIN
Hello. You look great.

She gives him a peck on the cheek. Steven winces.

CABLE GUY
And you are a vision. Hello Steven.
You're looking rested.

STEVEN
Come here.

He pulls the Cable Guy aside.

CABLE GUY
Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm
getting some really weird energy from
you.

STEVEN
Maybe it's because I just got out of
prison, where you sent me. I should just
drag you to the police right now.

CABLE GUY
You can if you like, but I'd hate to have
to show Robin this.

He takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker.

STEVEN
You son of a bitch.

The Cable Gut quickly puts it away.

CABLE GUY
Come on Steven, let's just have a good
time tonight.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

Robin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over.

EARL
Steven, your mother and I had a long talk
with your friend Larry here when he came
over to screw in the cable.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
(to the Cable Guy)
Thank you again for that.

EARL
(beat)
We owe you an apology. I didn't realize
the seriousness of your problems. You're
obviously going through some kind of
personal hell and I need to be more
understanding. We didn't get involved
with things like that when I was your
age.

Steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them.

EARL
I know we haven't been there for you
lately but we're going to see you through
this, 'cause we are a family. I love
you.

He gives him a big hug. Steven grimaces.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
You've got a good friend here.

They walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails.

Steven's brother PETE walks over to Steven. He carries a baby in a pouch.

PETE
(winks)
Hey buddy, we're with you. Keep your
chin up.

71	INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

As the Cable Guy charms Steven's family we pan across all of the guests laughing, and enjoying 
dinner.

CABLE GUY
So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and
he's chasing me, swinging like a mad
man. I'm yelling at him,
'hey, it's just a show!'

(Revision Ends - Blue)

STEVEN'S SISTER
He always takes things too seriously.

CABLE GUY
Tell me something I don't know. This guy
almost took my head off.

Everybody laughs.

The camera moves to Steven. He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage.

STEVEN'S P.O.V.

The Cable Guy is talking and eating in SLOW-MOTION.

ON STEVEN - watching him. He is in normal motion.

ON THE CABLE GUY - eating in SLOW-MOTION

ON STEVEN - getting very irritated.

STEVEN
What are you doing?

ON THE CABLE GUY

As he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow 
motion.

CABLE GUY
It's from "Goodfellas." Remember the
intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two
Times.

He moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs.

TONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun.

TONY/CABLE GUY
Pow, pow, pow. You're under arrest.

Everyone laughs. The Cable Guy starts running around the table. Tony makes chase, laughing all 
the way.

CABLE GUY
You'll never catch me copper.

The Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends 
it's a moustache.

CABLE GUY
I'm gonna wear a disguise.

Steven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees the Cable Guy. The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's 
date appears in front of the Cable Guy's face. Steven realizes that they are the same person.

Steven gets a frightened look on his face.

The kid points his gun at the Cable Guy and yells "pow." The Cable Guy drops to the floor like 
he's been shot.

CABLE GUY
Oh, you got me.

The Cable Guy plays dead. The kid walks over to him. When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges 
to grab him.

CABLE GUY
(devil voice)
Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and lives!

The kid screams with laughter and runs away. The Cable Guy chases him around the table and out 
of the room. Steven instantly fears for Tony's safety. He follows them.

72-75	OMITTED

75A	INT. LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER

Steven walks around looking for Tony. Suddenly from behind a couch Tony and the Cable Guy 
pop out.

TONY/CABLE GUY
Booo!

Steven flies back, scared out of his wits. Tony and the Cable Guy start laughing hysterically. They 
have a grand 'ol time enjoying their little prank.

CABLE GUY
Oh man, you should have seen your face.
It was classic.

STEVEN
Very funny. Tony, go to your mother!

Tony immediately starts crying. He leaves.

CABLE GUY
Look what you've done.

STEVEN
I know you beat up Robin's date.

The Cable Guy's laughter stops on a dime.

CABLE GUY
I guess I did what you didn't have the
guts to do.

STEVEN
You stay away from Robin.

CABLE GUY
(disturbed)
Don't mess with me. I'm feeling like a
part of the family, and I like it. You
should try it sometime.

Steven's mother enters.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
(looks at them)
My, you two look like brothers. Come on
back, we're all having coffee in the
living room.

Cable Guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room.

CABLE GUY
(happily)
Are you guys trying to fatten me up?
'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn
good job of it.

He laughs, and exits. Steven slowly follows.

76-78 OMITTED

79	INT. LIVING AREA - LATER

Everyone is sitting around having coffee. The Cable Guy is writing words on torn up pieces of 
paper.

CABLE GUY
You guys have never played "Porno
Password?"

EARL
No, but I like the sound of it.

CABLE GUY
It's the adult version of the popular
television game show. Robin you're on my
team. Steven, you're with mom.
(to everyone else)
You're the audience.

The Cable Guy sits next to Robin. Steven and his mother sit across from them.

The Cable Guy looks at the word, then shows it to the family so none of the contestants can see it. 
He whispers it in Steven's ear.

CABLE GUY
(whispers)
The password is vagina.

Steven winces.

STEVEN
I really don't want to play this game.
(looks to his mother)
Woman. Woman.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
Uh man?

STEVEN
No.

CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis.

Robin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out.

CABLE GUY
Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis.

ROBIN
Vagina?

CABLE GUY
(pumps his fist)
Yes!

He high fives Robin. Everyone laughs.

EARL
(blurts out)
I thought it was going to be schlong!
(covers his mouth - embarrassed)
Whoops.

Everyone laughs. They are all having a great time, except Steven. The Cable Guy looks at the next 
word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven.

CABLE GUY
The password is nipple.

STEVEN
Can I pass?

EARL
Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the
mud.

STEVEN
Breast. Breast.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
Tit?

Everyone laughs. Steven's face is red.

CABLE GUY
Hard
(gestures like there is another word after it)
Hard

ROBIN
Erection?

Everyone laughs. Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy.

STEVEN
Center. Center.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
Nipple?

Everyone cheers.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
I can't believe I got it. I was going to
say areola.

Everyone laughs except Steven, who is mortified.

CABLE GUY
I wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead.

The Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear.

CABLE GUY
The password is I'm not sure how to
pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or
clit-oris.

STEVEN
(snaps)
I can't say that to my mother!

EARL
Hey, she's a grown woman. She can handle
it.

ROBIN
Come on Steven. We're just having fun.

STEVEN
No, I've had enough. I can't do this.
This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit
here and play X-rated party games with
him.

EARL
Steven, I really think you're over-
reacting.

STEVEN
I am not over-reacting. You're all being
fooled by this guy! He's a felon for
Christ sake!
(to the Cable Guy)
I hate you! Get out of my life!

CABLE GUY
I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance,
I will leave. I would never stay where I
am not wanted.

ROBIN
(to the Cable Guy)
You're not a nuisance. Please don't go.
(to Steven)
Steven, you're being an asshole.

EARL
Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one
with the problem.

STEVEN
What? You have no idea what this guy is
really like.

CABLE GUY
I'll just go.

STEVEN
See what I mean!

CABLE GUY
Steven, what's with you tonight?
(gets close to Steven and whispers)
Robin showed me that birthmark on her
left shoulder. It's very sexy.

Steven punches the Cable Guy in the facem sending him to the floor. All of the women, including 
Robin run to help him.

ROBIN
(to Steven)
I can't believe you.

The Cable Guy gets up.

CABLE GUY
I'm fine. Thank you for a delightful
evening.
(to Steven)
I forgive you.

He exits. Everyone looks at Steven like he is the devil.

STEVEN
You don't understand.

Everyone walks away from Steven. The party is over.

80	EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER

Robin is venting her anger at Steven as they walk to the car.

ROBIN
I just think you were completely out of
line. I don't know what's happening to
you these days.

Steven gets fed up.

STEVEN
Robin, this guy is a sociopath. He
leaves messages on my machine night and
day. He shows up wherever I go. He
won't leave me alone.

ROBIN
Sounds familiar.

STEVEN
You know he was the one who beat up your
date at that restaurant. That's right.
And he gave you the free cable. It wasn't
me.

ROBIN
But you took the credit for it?

STEVEN
That's what he wanted. He was
manipulating me. It feels so good to be
honest about this. We're finally
communicating. I've been wanting to tell
you for so long, but he's been
blackmailing me.

ROBIN
Blackmailing you? How?

STEVEN
With a photograph.

ROBIN
Of what?

STEVEN
Me with a... prostitute.

ROBIN
What?!

STEVEN
He set it up. He invited this woman to
my party and didn't tell me she was a
prostitute. I'm so glad we can talk
about this.

ROBIN
When did you have a party?

STEVEN
When we weren't communicating. I invited
you. You were out on a date.

ROBIN
And you were with a prostitute.

STEVEN
She seduced me. That's what they do.
They're professionals. And I didn't even
know she was a prostitute.

ROBIN
So that makes it better?

STEVEN
That's not the point. The point is this
guy has been setting me up. He's
responsible.

ROBIN
He didn't have sex with a whore. You
did.

STEVEN
Robin you don't --

ROBIN
I don't want to hear it. Breaking up was
the best thing we ever did. You have
some serious problems, and it's not my
responsibility to help you. I am only
responsible for my own happiness.

STEVEN
Where did that come from?

ROBIN
It was Jerry Springer's "final thought."

She exits.

80A	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

Rick is running to an editing bay. Steven follows him.

STEVEN
I'm sorry I've been blowing you off.

RICK
You bet your ass you've been blowing me
off.

STEVEN
It's just, this guy is really doing a
number on me.

RICK
I told you not to hang out with him.

STEVEN
You're the one who told me to offer him
money so I could get free cable.

RICK
You didn't tell me he was a psychopath.
(beat)
I'll see if I can get my friend in
research to track him down. What's his
name again?

STEVEN
Ernie Douglas.

RICK
Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does
that sound so familiar?

81	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television.

On the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman.

Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN 
DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse."

BACK TO SCENE

Steven walks over to Joan.

STEVEN
(to his secretary)
Did anyone notice I'm late?

JOAN
What are you talking about, you've been
here for an hour.

STEVEN
Thank you.

Steven walks to his office.

81A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Steven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He 
clicks a button and a message comes on the screen.

ON THE SCREEN - "GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S 
AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE."

Then an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the 
computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before 
they watched "Sleepless in Seattle."

STEVEN
Work's good.

ROBIN
How's Hal?

STEVEN
Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

ROBIN
It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

STEVEN
I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing 
on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs 
out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this.

81B	OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office.

BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can.

81C	INT. HAL'S OFFICE

Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and 
sees Steven.

HAL
Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I
have no vision.

Steven knows what's coming.

82C	INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER

Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car 
alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming 
car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear.

STEVEN
Chip! Chip, this isn't funny! Where are
you?!!!

Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through 
the garage.

Steven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the 
Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown 
into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar 
of the luggage rack.

Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him.

As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the 
hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control 
of the car.

STEVEN
Leave me alone! I have no job, no
girlfriend, no family anymore! It's
over! You won!

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

CABLE GUY
(menacingly)
Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin'
started.

He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car. The Cable Guy falls to the 
ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, 
scampering like a supernatural bug.

ON THE TV - The local news.

MARK THOMPSON
The jury has notified the judge that they
are very close to reaching a verdict, and
would like to keep deliberating into the

Rick is sitting at his desk. A FEMALE RESEARCHER walks over, and sits down.

RESEARCHER
There are five people named Ernie Douglas
in this county. Two are African
American. One is eighty-five years old.
One is eleven years old, and the last one
is in a wheelchair.

RICK
So we're nowhere. Ernie Douglas? Ernie
Douglas?

She begins tapping her foot nervously.

RICK
Could you stop that?

RESEARCHER
Don't snap at me. I'm doing this as a
favor.

He continues staring at her two-tone wing tipped style shoe.

RICK
(has an epiphany)
Wait, could you start that again? Start
tapping your foot again.

She begins tapping. Rick begins humming the theme to "My Three Sons." She joins him. They sing 
louder and louder. They've broken the code.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

96	INT. STEVEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGS. Steven runs in the front door, and picks up the phone.

STEVEN
Hello.

RICK (VO)
Bingo. "My Three Sons."

STEVEN
Chip and Ernie Douglas.

97	INT. NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS - INTERCUT

Rick sits at his desk. The researcher is at his side.

RICK
I've got a list of every cable installer
fired in the last four years. Every one
of these guys has the same physical
description as our friend.
(reads from the list)
Murray Slaughter, Brendan Walsh, Sam
Malone, Alex Reiger. There was even a
guy who liked to be called 'the big
Ragu.'

97AA	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven walks in and looks for the Cable Guy's hidden camera as he speaks on the phone.

STEVEN
Carmine from "Laverne and Shirley."

RICK
That's so sad that you know that.
Anyway, the cable company in town fired a
guy six months ago named Darren Stevens.
He stole the truck and disappeared.
That's our guy.

Steven finds a small camera in one of the television speakers. He rips it out.

STEVEN
So he doesn't even work for the Cable
Company?

97A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Quick cuts of Steven bolting doors, and locking windows.

RICK (VO)
He was fired for beating up a customer
who yelled at him for being late. A
company in Denver thinks they might have
a lead on who he really is.
If I were you I'd lock down tonight.
I'll call you when I get some more info.

98	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Steven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake.

ON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking.

PROSECUTOR (ON TV)
Don't let your memories of these cute
twins distract you from the fact that
this funny star of a situation comedy
killed his own brother in cold blood,
then called the police and said he was
killed by an Asian gang. There was no
laugh-track on that night.

The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep.

99	ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP	HE SLOWLY WAKES UP.

The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar.

ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We 
reveal that it is the Cable Guy.

CABLE GUY
This man killed his own brother. Some
people don't even have a brother...

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera.

CABLE GUY
...do they Steven? Are you listening to
me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it --

ON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room.

100	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the 
living room and sees Rick.

RICK
Why do you keep icing me man?

100A	INT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

He opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The 
two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the 
door.

100B	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he 
sees Robin's bedroom.

100C	INT. ROIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robin is in bed. A man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow. The 
man turns -- it is Steven. He quickly closes the door.

100D	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He hears someone pounding on the front door. He opens the door. Nobody is there. Then the 
Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord.

CABLE GUY
You owe me!

Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole.

101	P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and 
more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from 
frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs 
again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the 
door.

102	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him.

Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast 
but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the 
Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks 
back another time and the Cable Guy is gone.

He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. 
He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab 
him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.

CABLE GUY
I just want to hang out. No big deal.

Steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room.

103	OMITTED

104	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do.

He puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The 
Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger.

CABLE GUY
Steven, you're just like me. We're cut
from the same cloth. We're one and the
same!

Then it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television.

105	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven wakes up in a cold sweat.

STEVEN
(panting)
Oh my god. She's right. I am a
smotherer. I'm just like him.

The phone rings.

STEVEN
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)
It didn't have to come to this Steven.
We could have been blood brothers.

STEVEN
Rick told me you were fired from The
Cable Company. You're not even a real
cable guy.

106	INT. SOMEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

Close up of the Cable Guy's face.

CABLE GUY
Do you feel good now that you've hurt me?
Well now I'm going to have to hurt you.
I'm going to take away what you hold
dearest in the world.

STEVEN (VO)
I swear to God, if you touch --

CABLE GUY
Could you hold on a second, I've got call
waiting. It'll just be a sec.

He clicks over. Steven just sits there, waiting. Waiting some more. Then the Cable Guy clicks 
back.

CABLE GUY
Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh yeah.
You're going to feel my wrath.

107	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

STEVEN
(pleading)
Don't do this. There must be some way
for us to work this out.

108	INT. SOMEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

CABLE GUY
I wish there was.
(losing it)
Oh Steven, I'm just so tired. So very
tired.

STEVEN
Let's talk in person. Where are you?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

CABLE GUY
I'm close. So very close.

The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises 
up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single 
beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his 
face. He never acknowledges it.

CABLE GUY
You know, I don't think you're right for
Robin. She needs someone who can be
sensitive to her needs. Someone who
understands her soul.

STEVEN
You stay away from her.

CABLE GUY
Aren't we the control freak. Looks like
you're starting to sweat.

STEVEN
I got the camera. You can't see me.

Steven begins to pick his face.

CABLE GUY
Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your
face?

Steven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking 
for the camera. He smashes his TV.

JUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment.

CABLE GUY
You're getting closer.

Steven overturns a CD rack.

CABLE GUY
Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know
sometimes the answer is right under your
nose.

Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. 
He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out.

He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face 
into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad 
man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears 
the Cable Guy scuttle away.

Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the 
aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, 
then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small 
makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.

There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing 
next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the 
Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television 
monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a 
cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it.

Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door.

108A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

It is raining lightly outside. Steven is in his car. He pulls away quickly.

109	INT. RICK'S NEWSROOM - NIGHT

Rick sits at his desk. The PHONE RINGS.

RICK
Hello.

109AA	INT. MOVING VEHICLE - NIGHT

Super Close Up - What the audience will think is Steven's mouth (actually the Cable Guy) 
speaking on a cellular phone.

STEVEN
Hey Rick. I need to meet with you right
away. I've got some information about
this crazy cable guy.

RICK
Me too. I've got the whole story.

STEVEN
That's great. Let's meet at the old
school at nine-thirty.

RICK
Why all the way out there?

STEVEN
I think he's been following me. Don't be
late, buddy.

109AB	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Steven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE 
NEIGHBOOR opens her door.

STEVEN
Be home! Be home!

FEMALE NEIGHBOOR
Go away! I remember you. You're her
obsessive boyfriend. She said you might
come here. I'm calling the police.

She closers her door. He runs off.

109A	EXT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - NIGHT

Rick drives up, then walks into the building.

110	INT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Rick walks through the school looking for Steven.

RICK
Steven? Steven?

In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.

STEVEN
Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear
what you found out about this nut.

RICK
I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply
troubled. Only child. His mother was
arrested for prostitution, and phone
solicitation. Apparently she was some
phone sex pioneer.

STEVEN
No way.

RICK
And get this, he was discharged from the
Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so
he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two
using a Radio Shack computer. And that's
not the half of it.

As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, 
but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of 
Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).

CABLE GUY
Really? Tell me more.

Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.

CABLE GUY
I'm very interested in learning
everything I can about that wacked out
cable installer.

He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not 
see Rick yelp, and fall.

CABLE GUY
It sounds like he might hurt somebody.

110A	INT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT

Steven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings. He picks it up.

STEVEN
(panicked)
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)

Nosey friends for two hundred. This
supposed pal of Steven's is currently
residing in the intensive care unit of
Good Samaritan Hospital.

112	INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Steven flies through the swinging doors, and runs through the hallway of the hospital. He walks up 
to a DOCTOR.

STEVEN
(rapid fire)
Rick Legatos. He's a friend of mine.
Where is he?

DOCTOR
Room 205.

STEVEN
Can I see him?

DOCTOR
Yes. But he can't speak. He's in shock.

113	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his 
rear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious.

Steven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and 
sees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an 
antenna. Inside the TV is the word "RING."

STEVE
(perplexed)
Ring?

The phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.

STEVEN
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)
Poor Rick. Seems he had a little
accident with the business end of a
staple gun.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

STEVEN
You're not going to get away with this.

CABLE GUY
The question is, are you going to get
away with it? Apparently there was an
anonymous tip placed to the police
leading them to a staple gun at the crime
scene with your fingerprints all over it.

ROBIN
(VO)
All right, I'm ready.

114-6	OMITTED (NOW A PART OF SCENE 106)

Be right there.

STEVEN

I've got to go. We're going to take a
romantic stroll on the information
superhighway.

Steven drops the phone, and runs out of the room.

116B	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs down the hall to the elevator. Before he reaches it the doors open, and the two 
policemen who arrested him at work walk out. Steven quickly turns left, but the policemen see 
him, and make chase.

OFFICER
Hey, hold it!

116C	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Steven runs out of the hospital. The two policemen run after him, about twenty feet behind. 
Steven jumps in his car, and takes off. The police follow in their car.

Steven's car turns a corner, and flies down a busy boulevard. A second later the police cars follow 
with sirens blaring.

116E	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin are at the dish. He gives her the same tour he gave Steven earlier in the 
film.

CABLE GUY

Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.

116F	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The chase continues.

116G	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin are now standing on the edge of the dish.

CABLE GUY
The future is now. Soon every American

phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on another.
You can do your shopping at home, or play
a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in
Vietnam.

117	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The chase continues.

Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of 
traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a 
dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the 
police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way.

117A	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

ROBIN
This is really fascinating, but I really
think we ought to go now.

CABLE GUY
I knew you'd appreciate it. I took
Steven here once, and he didn't give a
rats ass about my interests.

ROBIN
I'm worried about Steven.

CABLE GUY
Maybe Steven should be worried about you.
(beat)
So, where was I?

122	EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and 
begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds 
of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight 
toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he 
smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs.

The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over 
Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.

CABLE GUY
(chuckles)
Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed
it all last month.

The Cable Guy rides toward him again.

CABLE GUY
(like the Vegas announcer)
Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!

(Revision Ends - Blue)

This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle 
of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.

STEVEN
Where's Robin?!

CABLE GUY
This isn't about Robin, this is about you
and me.

Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy.

STEVEN
Where's Robin?!!!

Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like 
warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.

STEVEN
Tell me!

CABLE GUY
(nonchalantly)
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?

Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams 
into the ground.

CABLE GUY
Steven you've changed.
(beat - then impressed)
I like it.

The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.

They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of 
his belt and turns it on.

CABLE GUY
I think it's time to make you cable ready.

He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large 
branch and bats the Cable Guy off him.

The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion 
which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.

CABLE GUY
Last time we fought I let you win! Best
two out of three!

MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.

CABLE GUY
(crazed)
You treat me like the TV! You use me, but
you can't live without me!

The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.

CABLE GUY
You can't shut me off with your remote
control!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick
and Mommy and Daddy and brother and
sister and cousin --

Steven smashes him in the head with the branch.

STEVEN
I got the point.

The Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious.

ROBIN
(in the distance)
Steven.

He looks to the dish, but cannot see her.

123	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER

Steven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled 
with several feet of rain water.

Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the 
satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the 
center of where those wires meet.

Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.

ROBIN
Help me Steven!

In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at 
the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.

ROBIN
Steven! Look out!

CABLE GUY
(mimics her)
Yeah Steven. Look out!

The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking 
Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the 
water.

CABLE GUY
(sweetly, like a girl)
I've missed you.

The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy 
dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and 
speaks right into his face.

CABLE GUY
(dramatically)
"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it."
Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't
know what the fuss was about, the movie
ruled, I saw it six times.

He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.

CABLE GUY
Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in
this position?

He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.

CABLE GUY
Who would have thunk it?

Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have 
knocked his jaw out of alignment.

CABLE GUY
(without any lisp)
You're gonna have to do better than that
Steven.
(realizing his lisp is gone)
Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.

Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.

CABLE GUY
(lisping again)
You stupid son of a bitch.

The Cable Guy falls unconscious.

ROBIN
Steven!

Steven runs to her.

124	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER

He runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the 
WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance 
several times.

STEVEN
Hang on.

CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.

CABLE GUY
(laughs maniacally)
I know what your saying. Who does this
guy think he is, Jason?

STEVEN
Stay away from her!

Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.

CABLE GUY
I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony
Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of
the Rich and Famous." He still looks
terrific.

Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's 
landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging 
there.

The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.

CABLE GUY
And the race is on.

He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.

Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and 
joins him.

The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.

CABLE GUY
(knows he's about to fall)
This is such an anti-climactic way to end
this.

The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his 
demise.

125	EXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER

Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are 
exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.

ROBIN
I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love
you.

STEVEN
I love you too. You're right. We
shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of
problems to work out which have
absolutely nothing to do with you.

ROBIN
We'll work them out together.

They kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts 
coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.

CABLE GUY
(between coughs)
What just happened? Where am I?
(remembers)
Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you.

He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays 
him on the ground.

CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it
on Sly Stallone in "Rocky Three." He
should wake up in thirty seconds, so
let's get going.

He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.

Steven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the 
rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.

126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.

The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin 
with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the 
platform.

STEVEN
Easy.

He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish 
below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.

CABLE GUY
It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm
just trying to show you the kind of
things that can happen when you mistreat
people.

STEVEN
Don't do anything stupid.

CABLE GUY
You know this is just like that secen in
that Clint Eastwood movie "Dirty Harry" --

STEVEN
(snaps)
No! This is not like anything! This is
not a movie! We're real people! You're
hurting us! This is reality!

The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of 
Robin. She runs to Steven's arms.

From below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. 
The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.

CABLE GUY
If this is reality...
(he climbs onto the guard railing)
...I am outta here.

The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.

STEVEN
Nooo!

Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other 
hand.

STEVEN
You're not going anywhere.

The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto 
the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.

STEVEN
Don't do this. You just need help. We all
get lonely.

CABLE GUY
Yeah, but I get really lonely.
(beat)
I mean, look at me.

STEVEN
You're gonna be fine. Just come on up.

CABLE GUY
(a long beat)
Steven, I think I sat too close to the
television. Mommy was right.

Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto 
his hand at the last possible second.

CABLE GUY
It's too late for me, but there's a lot
of little Cable Boys out there who still
have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby-
sitter.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

The Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand. He begins falling toward the dish below.

blinks at the tip of the needle. Then, the Cable Guy's eyes open.

CABLE GUY
Damn, that hurt like a mother. What the
hell was I thinking?
(looks at the needle)
Oh man, that stings.

Steven and Robin look relieved.

The Cable Guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter. Steven and 
Robin are covered in police blankets. Steven calls to a paramedic.

STEVEN
Is he going to be all right?

PARAMEDIC
I don't know. It's in God's hands.

The paramedics put the Cable Guy on the helicopter. The helicopter flies away.

CABLE GUY
Am I really your buddy?
