          It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE
          OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations,
          black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls.
          
          Everyone, that is, except the people that live in...


          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

          The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world.

          The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic
          harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters
          on the roof.
          

          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM DAY

          We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the
          corner..

                                  COMMENTARY
                     ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years
                   old, arriving at the polling station
                   of his constituency in Sedgefield.."
          
          QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is
          posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT
          ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many
          Charities of which she is patron)..


                                   ELIZABETH
                     Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?

                                  ARTIST

                           (proudly dabbing palette)
                     Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they
                    opened. First in line. Seven o'clock.
          
                                COMMENTARY

                    If he wins, he'll be the youngest
                   Prime Minister in almost two hundred
                   years.."

          He straightens..
          
                                 ARTIST
                   And I don't mind telling you, it
                   wasn't for Mr Blair.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Not a moderniser, then?

          
          
                               ARTIST
                   Certainly not. We're in danger of
                   losing too much that's good about this
                   country as it is.
          
                               TV COMMENTARY
                   "The only questions that still remain:
                   how big will his landslide be? And how
                   extensive, how sweeping will the
                   modernisation programme be that he
                   ushers in?"
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   Hmm.
          
          The QUEEN watches as he paints..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I rather envy you being able to vote.
                        (a beat)
                   Not the actual ticking of the box,
                   although, I suppose, it would be nice
                   to experience that ONCE.
                        (a beat)
                   But the sheer joy of being partial.
          
                              ARTIST
                   Yes..
          
          The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass..
          
                               ARTIST
                   One forgets that as Sovereign, you are
                   not entitled to vote.

                               ELIZABETH
                   No.
          
                               ARTIST
                   Still, you won't catch me feeling
                   sorry for you. You might not be
                   allowed to vote, Ma'am..
                        (a beat)
                   But it IS your Government.
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   Yes.
          
          The QUEEN raises her eyebrow..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I suppose that is some consolation.
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
          
                              

          
          
                                                                  3.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am.
          Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something
          else..
          
          The stirring sound of bagpipes..
          
          
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In a ritual
          unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed PIPER, wearing a
          kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her
          Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes.
          
           t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up
          wherever she is - anywhere in the world.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Darkness. A soft knock at the door. (The strains of bagpipes
          can still be heard from below). Her Majesty's DRESSER sticks
          her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey
          tea and the newspapers.
          
                               MAID
                   G'morning, Ma'am.
          
          The DRESSER puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table.
          
                               DRESSER
                  Shall I draw the curtains?
          
          The QUEEN's sleepy voice answers..`Please'. The DRESSER goes
          to the window.
          
                               ELIZABETH (O.S)
                   Did you stay up?
          
                                 DRESSER
                   Yes, Ma'am.
          
                               ELIZABETH (O.S)
                   And? Was it as expected..?
          
          The QUEEN's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the
          newspapers. She puts on her glasses.
          
                                RESSER
                   Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.
          
          The QUEEN's expression changes..
          
                         
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   I see.
          
          She lifts the newspaper up. The front page comes into sharp
          focus.
          
          FULL FRAME: the beaming smile of TONY BLAIR, the new Prime
          Minister. The QUEEN stares back. Their eyes meet - as it
          were. Headlines tell us..
          
                 "IT'S BLAIR!", "LANDSLIDE VICTORY FOR BLAIR".
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY
          
          The QUEEN sits at breakfast. Reading the newspapers. Dogs
          under the table. A knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN,
          (40's), her deputy Private Secretary, pops around..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   The Prime Minister is on his way,
                   Ma'am.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   To BE, Robin.
                        (correcting, terse)
                   Prime Minister to BE.
          
          The QUEEN frostily flicks a page, without looking up..
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   He hasn't asked my permission yet.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          The QUEEN and JANVRIN walk through a corridor of the Palace.
          It has the air of a grand hotel. Chintz. Flock. Long, gilded
          mirrors. Portraits on the walls..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   He's a hard one to read, isn't he?
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Yes. On the one hand his background is
                   quite establishment. Father a
                   Conservative. A public school
                   education at Fettes, where he was
                   tutored by the same man as the Prince
                   of Wales.

                                ELIZABETH
                   Well, we'll try not to hold that
                   against him.
          
                         

          
                                                                5.
          
          
          
                               JANVRIN
                   On the other, his manifesto promises
                   the most radical modernisation and
                   shake-up of the Constitution in three
                   hundred years.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do
                   you think?
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I wouldn't put it past him. He's
                   married to a woman with known anti-
                   Monarchist sympathies - you may
                   remember her curtsey the first time
                   you met. It could best be described as
                   `shallow'.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I don't measure the depth of a
                   curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my
                   sister.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary
                   who said he was expecting the
                   atmosphere at Downing Street to be
                   very informal. Everyone on first name
                   terms.
                        (a beat)
                   At the Prime Minister's insistence.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What? As in `Call me Tony?'
          
                              JANVRIN
                   Yes.
          
          The QUEEN's face puckers in distaste..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of
                   that.
                         (a beat)
                   Have we sent him a protocol sheet?
          
          
          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: as TONY BLAIR's motorcade drives down the
          MALL.
          
          
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
          
          The motorcade sweeps into the grand, inner quadrangle of
          Buckingham Palace, and stops at the King's door.
          

          
                                                                6.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CAR - DAY
          
          Three secret service BODYGUARDS leap out and open the car
          doors. TONY looks out at the palace..
          
                               TONY
                   Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.
          
                                HERIE
                    hy? You've met her often enough
                   before.
          
                               TONY
                   I know. But never one to one. And
                   never as Prime Minister.
          
                               CHERIE
                   Remember, you're a man that's just
                   been elected by the whole country.
                               T
                                TONY
                   Yes. But she's still, y'know..
          
          TONY looks up at the vast palace in front of him..
          
                                TONY
                   The Queen.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE - DAY
          
          A uniformed EQUERRY leads TONY and CHERIE through corridors,
          and up a grand staircase..
          
                               EQUERRY
                   When we reach the audience room, I
                   will knock. We will not wait to be
                   called, we will go straight inside.
                   Standing by the door, we bow. From the
                   neck. I will introduce you. The Queen
                   will extend her hand, you go to her,
                   bow again, then shake her hand.
          
          TONY shoots his cuffs, `Right', clears his throat.
          
                                QUERRY (cont'd)
                   Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am'
                   as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm.
          
                                 TONY
                   Yes..
          
                               EQUERRY
                   And when you're in the Presence, at no
                   point must you show your back.
          
                             

          
                                                                   7.

                               EQUERRY
                   Yes, Sir. That's what it's called,
                   when you're in her Majesty's company.

           TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers
          down her throat. TONY smiles back..
          
          The EQUERRY reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. Without
          waiting for a reply, he enters..
          
          CHERIE is left in the corridor. Alone. She stares at a
          liveried FOOTMAN.
          
          He stares back. No life behind his eyes. CHERIE takes a seat
          on a chair. Eyes widen to herself.
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          TONY and the EQUERRY enter, and gently bow their heads. The
          EQUERRY then straightens, and announces..
          
                               EQUERRY
                   Mr Blair, your Majesty.
          
          The QUEEN extends her hand. TONY walks forward, and shakes
          it. The EQUERRY leaves. The door is then closed.

                   Then we take your passport and spend
                   the rest of the time sending you
                   around the world.
          
                               TONY
                   You obviously know my job better than
                   I do.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister,
                   Mr Blair. I'd like to think there
                   weren't too many surprises left. My
                   first was Winston Churchill. He sat in
                   your chair, in frock coat and top hat,
                   and was kind enough to give a shy
                               T
                   young girl like me quite an education.
          
                                TONY
                   I can imagine.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    ith time, one has hopefully added
                   experience to that education, and a
                   little wisdom - better enabling us to
                   execute our constitutional
                   responsibility.
                        (a pointed addition)
                   To advise, guide and warn the
                   government of the day.
          
                               TONY
                   Advice which I look forward to
                   receiving.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    ell, we will save that for our weekly
                   meetings.
                         a beat)
                   Now, if there's nothing else, I
                   believe we have some business to
                   attend to..
          
          TONY stares, then clicks..
          
                                 TONY
                   Of course..
          
          He falls, rather extravagantly, on bended knee. The
          supplicant position of deference...
          
                  

          
                                                                 9.

                   Your Majesty, the country has
                   spoken...and I come now to ask your
                   permiss..   E
                                ELIZABETH
                        (interjecting)
                   No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask
                   the questions.
          
           TONY winces. Wishes the ground would swallow him up.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Mr Blair, the people have elected you
                   to be their leader. And so the duty
                   falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask
                   you to become Prime Minister, and form
                   a government in my name.
          
           TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Generally, this is where you say
                   `yes.'
          
                                 TONY
                   `Yes'.
          
          The QUEEN extends her hand, which TONY kisses. She withdraws
          it again - quite sharply, then DISCREETLY PRESSES A BUZZER by
          her chair indicating the ceremony is over. The EQUERRY opens
          a door, and CHERIE is invited inside.
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair.
          
           HERIE curtseys awkwardly, reluctantly, shallowly..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   You must be very proud.
          
                                  HERIE
                   Yes.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   And exhausted, I imagine. Where will
                   you be spending the summer?
          
                                 CHERIE
                   France.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   How lovely.
          
                               TONY
                    ou'll be in Balmoral, I expect.

                               ELIZABETH
                   Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful
                   place.
          
          The QUEEN indicates a portrait of QUEEN VICTORIA..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   My great, great grandmother said of it
                   - "In Balmoral all seems to breathe
                   freedom and peace and to make one
                   forget the world and its sad
                   turmoils."
          
           t that moment, the doors open, and JANVRIN enters, and
          whispers urgently in the QUEEN's ear. The QUEEN's face
          changes as she listens.
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Really..?
          
          Her expression changes. She frostily turns to the BLAIRS..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I'm afraid we're going to have to
                   leave it there.
          
          With that the QUEEN shakes TONY's hand. TONY and CHERIE
          awkwardly back out of the royal presence, leaving The QUEEN
          and JANVRIN.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Not too short, was it? I gave him
                   fifteen minutes.
                        (a beat)
                   One doesn't want to be rude.

          TONY and CHERIE walk down a corridor. CHERIE whispers under
          her breath..
          
                               CHERIE
                        (mimics QUEEN's manner)
                   "Thank you so much for coming. Now
                   bugger off."
          
                               TONY
                   I know. What was all that about?
          
                               CHERIE

          Doors slam. The CROWD surges. An explosion of flashlights.
          Tyres burn. The squeal of rubber as the MERCEDES pulls off.
          
          Swarms of PAPARAZZI give chase, kick-starting their
          motorcycles, speaking into cell-phones to their COLLEAGUES..
          

          
          
                                                                13.
          
          
          
          
          INT. RITZ HOTEL - SAME TIME
          
          The real ROYAL PARTY, meanwhile, walks briskly through an
          underground corridor which leads to the back door of the
          hotel..
          
          
          EXT. RITZ HOTEL - BACK EXIT - SAME TIME
          
          PAPARAZZI who were waiting at the back exit, speak to their
          COLLEAGUES on their cell phones, and are about to jump on
          their motorcycles to join them in the chase, when suddenly..
          
          HENRI PAUL, PRINCESS DIANA, her BODYGUARD and DODI FAYED
          emerge from a door, and climb into a waiting Mercedes. HENRI
          PAUL turns to the PAPARAZZI..
          
                               PAUL
                        (in French, we see sub-
                         titles)
                   Don't bother following. You won't
                   catch us.
          
          The engine starts with a roar. The PAPARAZZI double-take, and
          frantically shout into their phones to their COLLEAGUES.
          `Wait! They've come out at the back.'
          
          
          EXT/INT. MERCEDES LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
          
          The Mercedes pulls up at a traffic light.
          
          ALL AROUND THEM: the glare of Paparazzi motorcycles and
          camera flashbulbs around the car. The Paparazzi call out in
          French and Italian. They thump the window. It's terrifying.
          
          An explosion of flashing lights. Popping flashbulbs. The
          traffic light turns amber. DODI barks at the DRIVER..
          
          The DRIVER, a short squat man in glasses, (we do not see his
          face), slams his foot down.
          
          
          EXT. EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT
          
          The car roars ahead, then speeds down into a tunnel, followed
          by the PAPARAZZI MOTORCYCLES.
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT
          
          The Scottish Highlands. To establish.

          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
          The silhouette of a magnificent ten year old STAG stands on a
          rock, and roars into the night.
          
          
          INT. CRAIGOWEN LODGE - NIGHT
          
          `RRRRrrrinnnnggg', the phone rings..
          
          A SILHOUETTE fumbles for a light switch, and hits the light.
          We immediately recognise the face. It's JANVRIN, the Queen's
          deputy Private Secretary.
          
                               JANVRIN
                        (into PHONE)
                   Robin Janvrin.
          
          He listens, then his expression changes.
          
                               ANVRIN (cont'd)
                   What?
          
          He checks the clock on the bedside table, waking rapidly now.
          Deadly serious..
          
                                ANVRIN (cont'd)
                   Right. I see.
          
          JANVRIN hangs up. Then urgently dials a number on the
          telephone..
          
          
          INT. CRAIGOWEN LODGE - NIGHT
          
                               JANVRIN (cont'd)
                   I'm going to need to speak to her
                   Majesty. Right away.
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL ESTATE - NIGHT
          
           till pulling on clothes, JANVRIN rushes on foot towards the
          big house in the distance. Lights go on all over the darkened
          castle.
          
          
           NT. BALMORAL - STAIRCASE. NIGHT
          
           ANVRIN and a middle-aged   DRESSER, (half-asleep and still
          rearranging her uniform),   walk urgently up the stairs towards
          the second floor corridor   where the QUEEN's bedroom is
          located. They pass a PAGE   on the way down..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Tell Sir Guy I'd like everyone in. As
                   soon as possible.
          
          The PAGE nods. Departs.
          

          
                                                               15.
          
          
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          A knock on the door. The door opens, and the DRESSER's voice
          gently calls out..
          
                                 DRESSER
                   Ma'am?
          
           he QUEEN stirs in her bed..
          
                               DRESSER
                   Mr Janvrin is here to see you..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Oh..
          
          The QUEEN turns on the light. The DUKE of EDINBURGH flinches
          in irritation, scrunching his eyes as they are blinded..
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   What the..?
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
           he QUEEN emerges from her bedroom wearing an old-fashioned
          dressing-gown, and clutching a hottie, (a velour-covered
          Cosimax hot water bottle), to find ROBIN JANVRIN waiting..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Good evening, Ma'am. I'm sorry to
                   disturb..
          
          He clears his throat..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I
                    've just had a call from our Embassy
                   in Paris. It's...the Princess of
                   Wales.
          
          PRINCE PHILIP appears in the doorway. Irritable.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Why? What's she done now?
          
          
          INT. MYROBELLA - TRIMDON - TONY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          "Rrrrrinng", the phone rings. We're in TONY BLAIR's
          constituency house in Trimdon, near Durham in northern
          England.
          
           Click', TONY, in T-shirt, turns on the light. His face is
          creased with sleep. He blinks..
          

          
          
          
                                                                16.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   What? How badly?
          
          The figure of CHERIE stirs in the bed. Groans. TONY listens
          to the voice at the other end..
          
                               TONY
                   I see. Who are we speaking to there?
          
                                TONY
                   Right.
                         shell-shocked)
                   Keep me posted.
          
          TONY hangs up. CHERIE turns..
          
                               TONY
                   It's Diana. She's been in a car
                   accident. In Paris.
          
                               CHERIE
                   Is it serious?
          
                               TONY
                   Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.
          
                               CHERIE
                   What?
          
          CHERIE's face. Visibly shocked.   TONY has switched on the TV
          in the bedroom.
          
                               NEWSREADER
                   Let's just re-cap on what's happened.

          INT. BALMORAL - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
          
           he QUEEN is sitting with the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   What was she doing in Paris?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    ou know what she's like.
          
          The QUEEN flicks channels, peering over her glasses, trying
          to catch the latest news on the television..
          
          At that moment CHARLES enters the room. His face ravaged with
          concern. It's the first time the QUEEN has seen him since
          news of the crisis..
          

                                                            17.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   It's quite awful...
                         (wants to console CHARLES
                          but finds it easier to
                          say..)
                   What are you going to do about the
                   boys?
          
          An awkward moment. Stifled..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Let them sleep until we know more.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Yes that's sensible.
          
                               CHARLES
                   I should go to Paris. I told my people
                   to start organising a jet.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What? A private one?
          
                               HARLES
                   Yes.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Isn't that precisely the sort of
                   extravagance they attack us for?
          
                               CHARLES
                    ell, how else am I going to get to
                   Paris at this time of night? The
                   airport at Aberdeen will be closed.
          
          Presently, a voice from behind..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   You can use the Royal Flight. They
                   keep one of the planes on permanent
                   stand-by.
                         deadpans)
                   In case I kick the bucket.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Out of the question. It's not a matter
                   of State.
          
                                HARLES
                   What are you talking about?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a
                   member of the Royal Family. This is a
                   private matter.
          

                                                               18.
          
          
          
                                 CHARLES
                     She's mother to your grandchildren.

          The QUEEN MOTHER sits on the sofa next to PRINCE PHILIP..
          
                                 QUEEN MOTHER
                     That's the latest?
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                     I don't know. I can't hear..
                          (indicates TELEVISION)
                     Everyone's shouting!
          
          CHARLES stares in disbelief. Exits the room..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - JANVRIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
              television plays in the corner..

                     Good evening, Sir.
          
          JANVRIN listens to what the person is saying at the other
          end. His expression changes..
          
                                   JANVRIN
                     Right.

           NT. BALMORAL - 1ST FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
          
          An ashen-faced JANVRIN walks along the corridor, reaches the
          room where the ROYAL FAMILY is watching television.
          
           e clears his throat, knocks on the door..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - LARGE SITTING-ROOM - NIGHT
          
          JANVRIN enters.

          PRINCE CHARLES's face: he lets out a strangled cry, as he
          hears the news..
          
                                CHARLES
                     No!
          
          CHARLES roars in pain and disbelief. His knuckles whiten..
          
                                 CHARLES
                     No, no, no, no..!

          and already in Downing Street. Also watching television. (WE

                   Well, let's cancel everything else.

                   started coming up with ideas.

           he QUEEN's FACE in close-up. Her eyes flicker as she watches
          something intently.
          
           e REVERSE ANGLE to see: a half-open door. SILHOUETTES
          inside. The sound of male voices. Whispering. Speaking
          softly.
          
          It's the moment the BOYS are being told. We make out the
          SILHOUETTES hugging. The sound of tears. Soft voices. CHARLES
          repeatedly kissing his SONS.
          
           ur CAMERA stays on the QUEEN's FACE. A distant flicker of
          pain at the unrestrained intimacy and affection between them.
          
          Presently, the door opens, and a red-eyed PRINCE CHARLES
          emerges.
          
          C

                   They're going to go back to sleep.
                        (clears his throat, speaks
                         with difficulty)
                   Well, try anyway.
          
          The QUEEN goes up to CHARLES and stiffly, poignantly, tries
          to touch him. But cannot. Is unable. She withdraws her hand.
          
                               CHARLES
                        (reading the message)
                   My Private Secretary's office has
                   found a travel agency open in New York
                   that will sell me a flight to Paris
                   with an hour's stop over in
                   Manchester.
          
          CHARLES contains himself with difficulty..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Perhaps now you might consider whether
                   it's still an extravagance to bring
                   back the mother of the future King of
                   England in one of our planes?
          
                              ELIZABETH
                        (after a long pause)
                   All right.
          
           HARLES's eyes burn. He turns, and walks out.
          
          The QUEEN is left alone. She stares for a moment, then
          leaves, passing a FOOTMAN.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                        (to FOOTMAN)
                   I don't want the boys to see the news
                   and get upset. First thing tomorrow
                   morning, I want the radio taken out of
                   their bedroom, and the television
                   taken out of the nursery.
          
          The FOOTMAN bows..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - VERY EARLY DAWN
          
          The QUEEN sits in bed, writing her diary, in a bedchamber
          where the decor is unchanged in a hundred years..
          O
           utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of light.
          
          The DUKE OF EDINBURGH sticks his head around the corner. He
          looks at the QUEEN..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Well, well, well.

                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Are you all right?
          
          A silence.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
                   Your sister called about an hour ago.
                   From Tuscany.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                     hope you told her to come back? Cut
                   the holiday short?
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   I did.
          
          ELIZABETH raises her eyebrow..
          
                                  ELIZABETH
                       an't imagine she was pleased.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   That's putting it mildly.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What did she say?
          
          PHILIP smiles to himself recalling MARGARET's words..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Something about Diana managing to be
                   even more annoying dead than alive.
          
          The QUEEN looks up..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Just make sure the boys never hear you
                   talk like that.
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   Of course.
          
          PHILIP produces a bottle of pills from his dressing-gown
          pocket, and shakes them..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
                   Something to help you go down?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   No. I'm going to do my diary a little
                   longer.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Fine. I'll sleep next door.
          

                                                               23.
          
          
          
          PHILIP touches her on the shoulder. But she doesn't
          reciprocate. He goes. The QUEEN appears to continue writing,
          but our CAMERA slowly turns to reveal her PEN is not moving.
          Nor writing.
          
          She's staring in thought.
          
          
          AXT. MYROBELLA - DAY
            Victorian, red-brick house. In the driveway, the
          incongruous mix of a grey Renault Espace people-carrier and
          two POLICE VEHICLES.
          
          In the modest garden: two ARMED POLICE OFFICERS are playing
          football with three young CHILDREN..

          Inside the plain, unfashionably decorated house..
          
          The TV plays in the corner of the kitchen. CHERIE BLAIR,
          visibly upset, watches TV while cooking breakfast.
          
           TONY is not wearing his Newcastle shirt.
          
          TONY is reading out his statement which is written on a pad
          of paper, filled with crossings-out..

                   "..that's how she will remain. In our

          ALASTAIR CAMPBELL is in Downing Street, sits in an office,

                               TONY
                   I thought at church. On the way in.
          
          ON TV: breaking news: Diana's brother, EARL SPENCER, makes a
          statement from the gates outside his house in South Africa..
                               S
                                PENCER (ON TV)
                   ...this is not a time for
                   recriminations, however I would say
                   that I always believed that the press
                   would kill her in the end.

                               SPENCER(cont'd)
                   But even I could not imagine that they
                   would take such a direct hand in her
                   death as seems to be the case. It
                   would appear that every proprietor and
                   editor of every publication that has
                   paid for intrusive and exploitative
                   photographs of her has blood on his
                   hands today...
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   Not the press, mate. You've got the
                   wrong villain.
          
          An AIDE appears in the doorway, catches TONY's eye, and
          indicates her watch..
          
                               TONY
                   I've got to go.
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   You about to speak to the Queen?
          
                                TONY
                   Yes.
          
          ALASTAIR shoots a mischievous look..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   Ask her if SHE greased the brakes.
          
                                TONY
                   Now, now..
          
          TONY hangs up, crosses to the study, making sure the doors
          are shut so he won't be disturbed. We notice his shirt has
          no. 10 on the back, under the name, `BLAIR'.
          
          
           NT. BALMORAL - DINING ROOM - DAY
          
           he QUEEN, PRINCE PHILIP and the QUEEN MOTHER sit in silence
          at the table, eating breakfast, stoically listening to radio
          coverage, soberly flicking through newspapers..
          
          The QUEEN is the only one who is fully dressed, (the others
          in bathrobes), and she wears black. She is reading "The
          Sunday Times".
          
          All around them the QUEEN's (elderly) MAIDS perform the
          choreography of service as the radio coverage continues. One
          MAID pours tea. Another brings fresh toast.
          
          Also present is the rather smarter VALET and MAID belonging
          to the PRINCE of WALES, and his separate HOUSEHOLD. They have
          a separate, (and more stylish), uniform of their own.

          healthy food).

          A flamboyant napkin is folded into an elaborate fleur-du-lis,
          (traditional symbol of the PRINCE OF WALES). The QUEEN turns
          to Charles's VALET..
          
          A knock on the door, JANVRIN enters, and bows in respect to
          the QUEEN..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am, but I've

                   constituency.
          
                              QUEEN MOTHER
                        (privately rolls eyes,
                         without looking up from
                         newspaper)
                   Lucky you.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Thank you, Robin. I'll take it next
                   door.

          The first-floor corridor. STAFF flatten themselves against
          the wall, averting their eyes as..
          
          The QUEEN unexpectedly comes out of the dining-room, walks
          along the corridor, and disappears into..
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's study. High ceilings, portraits, stag's antlers
          on the wall. The QUEEN picks up the phone..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Good morning, Prime Minister.
          
          
          INT. TRIMDON - BLAIR'S STUDY - DAY
          
          The contrast in surroundings could hardly be greater. TONY
          sitting in a cramped room, surrounded by toys, in track suit,
          in a working-class house..
          
                                TONY
                   Good morning, your Majesty. May I say
                   right away how very sorry I am - and
                   that the thoughts and prayers of my
                   family are with you at this terrible
                   time and with the two princes in
                   particular.
          

          
                                                               26.
          
          
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Thank you.
          
           HERIE appears in the doorway.
          
                                TONY
                   Is it your intention to make some kind
                   of appearance. Or statement?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Certainly not.
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's face, bristling at the suggestion. (WE INTERCUT
          AS NECESSARY)..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   No member of the Royal family will
                   speak publicly about this. It is a
                   private matter and we would all
                   appreciate it if it could be respected
                   as such.
          
                                TONY
                   I see.
          
          TONY straightens, taken aback..
          
                               TONY
                   I don't suppose anyone has had time to
                   think about the funeral yet?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   We've spoken to the Spencer family,
                   and it's their wish..
                        (a beat)
                   ..their express wish, that it should
                   be a private funeral. With a memorial
                   service to follow in a month, or so.
          
                                TONY
                   Right.
          
          TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Given that Diana was no longer a
                   member of the Royal Family we have no
                   choice but to respect their wishes.
          
                                TONY
                   I see.
          
           TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..
          

                                                               27.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   You don't feel that in view of her
                   high profile and popularity..
                        (
                          choosing his words
                          carefully)
                   ...it might be an idea to pay tribute
                   to her life and achievements?
                        (a beat)
                   Or even just to her as a mother?
          
          The QUEEN's face freezes over.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.
          
                               TONY (cont'd)
                   And the public, Ma'am? The British
                   People?
          
          TONY hesitates..
          
                               TONY
                   You don't think a private funeral
                   would be denying them a chance..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    hance to what..?
          
                               TONY
                   To share in the grief?
          
          The QUEEN's face: did she hear right?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not
                   a fairground attraction.
                        (a beat)
                   I think the Princess has already paid
                   a high enough price for exposure to
                   the press, don't you?
          
          PRINCE PHILIP enters, dressed and ready for church. He
          indicates his watch..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Now, if there is nothing else I must
                   get on. The children have to be looked
                   after.
          
                                TONY
                   Of course.
          
          `Click', the QUEEN hangs up. TONY stares at the receiver.
          
                               TONY (cont'd)
                   Good bye, Your Majesty.
          

          
                                                               28.
          
          
          
          He puts down the phone...
          
                                TONY
                   Her instinct is to do nothing. Say
                   nothing. And give her a private
                   funeral.
          
                               CHERIE
                   Are you surprised? She hated her guts.
          
                               TONY
                   Well, I think it's a mistake.
          
          TONY's face becomes dark..
          
                               TONY
                   They screwed up her life. Let's hope
                   they don't screw up her death.

           veryone is getting ready to go to church. The QUEEN and
          QUEEN MOTHER are putting on their hats. PRINCE PHILIP, in
          full Highland regalia and black tie, helps both LADIES into
          their long coats...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   The Chaplain called. Wanted to know
                   whether he should make any changes to
                   the service or make special mention of
                   Diana.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   What did you say?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I told him he shouldn't change a
                   thing.
          
                                  UEEN MOTHER
                   Q
                    uite right.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I think the less fuss one makes, or
                   draws attention to it, the better.
                         she lowers her voice, as
                         the PRINCES approach from
                         the saloon with CHARLES)

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                   Yes.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   And we should probably arrange some
                   company for them. Some young people.

                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   I'll take them for a long walk this
                   afternoon. Up Craggy Head.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Good. They'd like that.
          
           RINCE PHILIP opens the doors..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   But no guns. It's Sunday.
          
          They walk off to the waiting CARS..

                               AIDE
                   Alastair? He's on..
          
          CAMPBELL turns, and excuses himself from his conversation,

          ON TV: TONY, wearing a dark suit, and tie, takes his position
          in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, in front of the

                    e are today a nation in a state of
                   shock, in mourning, in grief that is
                   so deeply painful to us. People
                   everywhere, not just here in Britain,
                   kept faith with Princess Diana..

          JANVRIN watches the broadcast on television, surrounded by
          several MEMBERS OF STAFF - MAIDS, COOKS, VALETS, FOOTMEN, all
          craning their necks, watching the television in the Private
          Secretary's room..

                    They liked her, they loved her, they
                   regarded her as one of the people. She
                   was the people's princess, and that is
                   how she will stay, how she will remain
                   in our hearts and memories forever.."

                   A bit over the top, don't you think?
          
          JANVRIN turns, fully expecting everyone to agree..
          
          But instead all the STAFF MEMBERS behind him have tears

                        (taps head, "Nuts")
                   Anyway, raves in the press.
          
          ALASTAIR dumps the papers on the desk..
          

          
          
                                                               37.
          
          
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   This lot call you "The Nation's
                   Mourner in Chief", this lot say you're
                   "The only person who has correctly
                   judged the mood of the country". Even
                   the "Mail"..
                        (disdainfully holding the
                         paper between finger and
                         thumb)
                   ..was impressed.
          
          ALASTAIR drops the papers on TONY's desk.
          
                                LASTAIR
                   "People's Princess", mate. You owe me.
          
           LASTAIR goes. TONY watches, then jumps up, opens the door.
          His AIDE calls after him, covering the phone..
          
                               AIDE
                   Gordon for you.
          
                               TONY
                   Tell him to hang on.
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          TONY follows ALASTAIR out, calls after him..
          
                               TONY (cont'd)
                   So it's decided? It's going to be a
                   public funeral.
          
                                LASTAIR
                   Yes. On Saturday. A whopper. The
                   Abbey. The works.
          
                               TONY
                   Good. Has anyone told the Queen yet?
          
                                LASTAIR
                   Dunno. No doubt some flunkey will be
                   despatched. Grovelling on all fours.
          
          TONY smiles imagining the prospect, goes back into his
          office.
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - LARGE SITTING-ROOM - DAY
          
          `Knock', a knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN enters
          carrying a large file. He bows first to the QUEEN..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Good morning, Ma'am.
          

          
                                                               38.
          
          
          
          ..then to the QUEEN MOTHER..

                   ..Ma'am.
          
          The QUEEN looks up..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What can we do for you, Robin?
          
          JANVRIN braces himself. This is not going to be easy...
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Ma'am, there was a meeting at the
                   Palace this morning.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   About the funeral arrangements, yes.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these
                   plans for you to consider.
          
          JANVRIN puts a large file on her desk..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   There is now general agreement, Ma'am,
                   that a public funeral would be more
                   appropriate.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   I see.
          
           he QUEEN perceptibly bristles..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    nd what form will it take?
          
                               JANVRIN
                   At the moment, they're suggesting..
                        (clears throat)
                   And of course these are early days..
          
          JANVRIN braces himself. Shoots a nervous look at the QUEEN
          MOTHER..
          
                               JANVRIN (cont'd)
                   ...basing it on Tay Bridge.
          
          The QUEEN MOTHER looks up. Horrified.
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Tay Bridge..?
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   What..?
          

          
                                                            39.
          
          
          
          A stunned silence..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   B-but that's the code name for my
                   funeral?    J
                                ANVRIN
                    ndeed, Ma'am.
                         (a beat)
                   But it would be for practical reasons
                   only.
          
          JANVRIN is dying.
          
                                ANVRIN
                   It's the only one which has been..
                        (treads delicately)
                   ..`rehearsed'. The only one that could
                   be put together..in time.
          
          The QUEEN MOTHER needs to sit down..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   But I supervised those plans myself.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was
                   at pains to stress the spirit of the
                   occasion will be quite different.

                   For example, in place of four hundred
                   soldiers marching behind the coffin,
                   the suggestion is that four hundred
                   representatives from the Princess's
                   various charities march behind the
                   coffin.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   I see..
          
          The QUEEN MOTHER's eyes widen..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   And that instead of foreign Heads of
                   State and Crown heads of Europe, the
                   guests would include a sprinkling of
                   actors of stage and screen, fashion
                   designers and other..
                        (clears throat)
                   ...celebrities..
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Celebrities..?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Oh.
          

          
          
                                                                40.
          
          
          
          The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a
          drink..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Wa..was there anything else?
          
                                 JANVRIN
                    o, Ma'am.
          
          JANVRIN bows, and leaves. Then stops, remembering..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police
                   Commissioner was keen that you
                   consider the idea of a condolence
                   book.
                         (a beat)
                   It would give the growing crowds
                   something to do. Make marshalling them
                   easier.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                        (distracted)
                   Yes, of course..
          
           ANVRIN reaches the door..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Oh, and the flowers.
          
           he QUEEN looks up..

                               JANVRIN (cont'd)
                   The flowers that have been left
                   outside Buckingham palace. Currently
                   they're blocking the path through the
                   main gate, and will make things
                   difficult for the Changing of the
                   Guard.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Fine. Then move them away.
          
           ANVRIN flinches slightly in anticipation..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was
                   wondering whether we shouldn't leave
                   the flowers, and send the Guards
                   through the North Gate.
          
          The QUEEN looks thrown..

                   Yes.
          
          TONY hangs up. He turns to his AIDE..

                   Bizarre. Why is Charles doing this?

                               TONY
                   Creeping up to me like this. He did it
                   at the airport when he asked me to
                   `deal' with his mother.

                   continues to get it wrong over Diana,

                   become public enemy no 1.

                   Who, Charles?
          
                               AIDE
                   His people have already been onto us
                   asking for extra protection.
          
                                IDE #2
                   He probably thinks if he's seen to be
                   on our side, the Queen will be the one
                   left in the firing line, not him.
          
                               TONY
                   What? So it's OK for his mother to
                   take the bullet, not him?
                         shakes head)
                   What a family.
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The QUEEN, in tatty old Barbour, head-scarf, Wellington
          boots, loads Corgis and picnic hampers into the back of an
          old Land Rover.
          

          
          
                                                                43.
          
          
          
          She climbs into an old, muddy Jeep, and starts the oily,
          smoky diesel engine. As she begins to drive out, she turns a
          corner, and passes CHARLES who is climbing into his much
          smarter, luxury, leather-upholstered jeep..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Wait! Where are they?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Up at Craigghead.
          
                               CHARLES
                   I'll come with you.
          
          CHARLES climbs in. The QUEEN notices how extravagantly
          dressed he is. A kilt and tailored hunting jacket..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   Want me to drive?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Certainly not.
          
           HARLES shudders at the rough interior of the car, the mud-
          spattered windows, the hard, uncomfortable ride..
          
                               CHARLES
                   I thought you were going to get a new
                               E
                   one of these?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   What for? It's perfectly all right.
          
          The engine splutters as she changes gear. The car lurches
          forward.
          
          
          INT/EXT. JEEP - BALMORAL ESTATE - DAY
          
           he QUEEN drives hard through woods, dust kicking up in the
          old Land Rover's wake. It's a bone-shaking ride.
          
           HARLES stares out of the window, lost in thought..
          
                               CHARLES
                   I was thinking last night what Diana
                   might have done had it been me that
                   died in the tunnel in Paris.
          
          The QUEEN privately rolls her eyes..
          
                               CHARLES
                   She would certainly have taken the
                   boys to Paris. I rather regret not
                   doing that now.
          

          
                                                                  44.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What? And expose them to the media? It
                   would have been a dreadful thing to
                   do. They're much better off here.
          
                               CHARLES
                   Look, whatever else you may have
                   thought of Diana - she was a wonderful
                   mother.
                         a beat)
                   She adored those boys. And never let
                   them forget it.
                         a beat)
                   Always warm.
          
           he QUEEN's hands tighten on the steering wheel..
          
                               CHARLES
                   And physical.
                         a beat)
                   Never afraid to show her feelings.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Especially whenever a photographer was
                   in sight.
          
                               CHARLES
                   Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that,
                   but still..
          
          CHARLES looks out of the window. His eyes mist over..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   That was always the extraordinary
                   thing about her. Her weaknesses and
                   transgressions only seemed to make the
                   public love her MORE. Yet ours only
                   make them hate us. Why is that?
          
          CHARLES looks up..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   Why do they hate us so much?
          
          The QUEEN mutters under her breath...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Not `us', dear.
          
                                 CHARLES
                           (not having heard)
                   What?
          
          The QUEEN salutes GAME-KEEPERS who remove their hats as the
          QUEEN roars past.
          

          
          
                                                               45.
          
          
          
                               CHARLES
                   Yesterday, when we drove the coffin
                   back into London, there was a noise. A
                   bang. I don't mind telling you I
                   thought it was a gun.
          
          CHARLES's hands wring in anxiety..
          
                               CHARLES (cont'd)
                   I thought someone had taken a shot at
                   me.
          
           he QUEEN hits the brakes, and pulls up. Visibly irritated by
          her son's weakness. She opens the door, and steps out..
                               E
                                ELIZABETH
                   Why don't you go on without me? I'm
                   going to walk back..
          
                               CHARLES
                   Are you sure?
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Yes. It looks like rain..
                        (the DOGS jump out)
                   And I'm not in the mood for stalking
                   anyway.
          
          CHARLES knows better than to contradict his mother. He gets
          into the driving seat, puts on the safety belt, and drives
          off.
          
          The Land Rover disappears in a cloud of dust.
          
          The QUEEN straightens, then notices her shoe-laces are
          undone. The DOGS bark excitedly.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You
                   don't want me to trip and hurt myself,
                   do you?
                         a beat)
                   You wouldn't get any proper walks
                   then.
          
          The QUEEN blissfully chatters away to the DOGS. So much
          easier than people...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Right. Done. Now who knows the way
                   home?
          
           he DOGS yap excitedly, immediately scamper off in the
          direction of the castle..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   You clever things!
          

          
                                                                   46.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY
          
           HARLES's Land Rover drives up into the hills, into
          spectacular landscape. A mile or two ahead, above the tree-
          line, PHILIP, the two PRINCES and STALKERS carrying guns,
          crawl on their bellies in pursuit of their quarry..
          
          A hundred years ahead of them, the STAG, unaware of the
          danger, imperiously, grazes on the grass..
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
          
          The QUEEN, granite-faced, still smarting from her row with
          CHARLES, is in her bedroom. A nightcap martini is on her
          bedside table. She is writing her diary.
          
          PHILIP emerges from the bathroom, appears in the doorway..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     I spoke to Charles this afternoon.
          
              flicker of coldness behind her eyes..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     Who was good enough to share with me
                     his views on motherhood.
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                     What did he say?
          A
            TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin, panda-eyes,
          the infamous Martin Bashir `PANORAMA' interview..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     How wonderful Diana was.
          
                                  RINCE PHILIP
                     That's changing his tune.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     What a natural.

                     some kind..
          
          PRINCE PHILIP sees what's on television, then grimaces..
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                          (puckers face)
                     Oh, for God's sake..
          

          
                                                               47.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are
                   partly to blame.
          
          PHILIP goes over to the television..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   I can't watch this.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   No, wait. Leave it.
          
          PHILIP stares at the screen..
          
                               DIANA (ON TV)
                   "Every strong woman in history has had
                   to walk down a similar path.."
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   We encouraged the match. And signed
                   off on it. Both of us.

                   You were very enthusiastic, remember.

                   She was a nice girl. Then.
          
                               DIANA (ON TV)
                   "And I think it's this strength that
                   causes the confusion and the fear."
          
          PRINCE PHILIP shakes his head..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   And I was sure he'd give the other one
                   up. Or, at least make sure his wife
                   towed the line.
                        (a gesture)
                   Isn't that what everyone does?
          
          A flicker behind the QUEEN's eyes.
          
                              ELIZABETH
                   Is it?
          
          Her knuckles momentarily whiten. Unaware, PHILIP stares at
          the television..
          
                               DIANA (ON TV)
                   "Why is she strong? Where is she
                   getting it from? Where is she going to
                   take it? How is she going to use it?"
          
          He rolls his eyes in disbelief..
          

                                                               48.
          
          
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
                   I can't bear it any more. If you're
                   watching, I'll sleep in here. Early
                   start tomorrow..
                        (kisses her on the
                         forehead)
                   See you in the morning.
          
          PHILIP goes, leaving the QUEEN staring. Still stinging from
          his remark about adultery.
          
           ZAP', she angrily hits the remote. The picture goes black.

          CHARLES. TONY and CHERIE sit on the sofa, watching
          television, eating pasta on their knees. STARKEY defends the
          QUEEN. Part of an older generation. She knows no better.

                               CHERIE
                   Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon
                   of privilege and wealth. They don't
                   pay tax.

                   Because...no would would wear it.

                         the idea)

                   Think about it. If she were still
                   alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the
                   same age? Whenever you talk about your
                   mother, you mention her stoicism. Her
                   frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact
                   she was brought up in the way. Well
                   c'mon..?

                   and there aren't enough barriers to
                   line the route. So we've gone cap in
                   hand to the French for theirs. And
                   there's something else I think you
                   should see.

           TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a television plays
          in the corner. Several young AIDES and INTERNS are watching,
          recording, making notes. Shirtsleeves, feet on desks.
          Informal.

                   going to love this.
          
          An INTERN puts in a video, hits the `play' button. ON SCREEN:
          several members of the public complain about the royals. TONY
          watches for a moment, then..

                   flying at half mast above Buckingham
                   Palace.

          The ROYAL FAMILY is gathered for a bar-be-cue lunch. At a
          distance, the BOYS, are in the river, being taught fishing by
          a GHILLIE..
          
          PRINCE PHILIP stands by a barbecue, struggling to get the
          fire to light. The QUEEN MOTHER is in another corner..
          A
            LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her dogs. She
          notices PHILIP's struggle with the bar-be-cue..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Those fire-lighters no good?

                   I brought some stew just in case. I
                   think it's lamb. We could always have
                   that cold..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   No, we'll be all right.
          
           he QUEEN throws some food to her dogs, but makes several
          hand gestures forbidding them to eat. The DOGS salivate, and
          whimper, but dutifully show their forbearance. Staring at the
          food.
          
          The QUEEN, meanwhile, starts setting places at the table with
          plates, knives and forks..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Robin had a call from the Prime
                   Minister. Who expressed his concern.
          
           HILIP turns, an exasperated look..
          
                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                   About WHAT?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   The flag above Buckingham Palace. He
                   thinks it should be flying at half-
                   mast.
          
          The DOGS continue to P
                               whimper hungrily.
          
                                RINCE PHILIP
                   Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T
                   a flag above Buckingham Palace...
                        (angrily jabs coals with a

                   To denote the presence of the Monarch.
                   Since you're here, the flag pole is
                   bare. Which is as it should be.
          
           HARLES clears his throat..
          
                               CHARLES

                   people...the Royal Standard is just..
                   ..a flag? And that the flap pole being
                   bare sends out the wrong signal.
          
          The QUEEN turns. A withering look..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   That's not the point.
          
                                RINCE PHILIP
                   The point is it's more than four
                   hundred years old. It has never been
                   lowered for ANYONE..

                   Your grandfather didn't get that flag
                   at half-mast when he died and if your
                   mother were to die tomorrow, she
                   wouldn't get it either.
          
                               CHARLES
                   Yes...but sometimes...in a situation
                   like this..one has to be flexible..

                   When we started with one, everyone
                   predicted they would grow and grow.

                   eventually be the one seen by the
                   public. But it's not. The two Dianas,
                   theirs and ours, bear no relation to
                   one another at all.

                   Prime Minister?
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          TONY sits up on his sofa in his office..
          
                               TONY
                   Good afternoon, your Majesty. I'm
                   sorry to disturb. I was just
                   wondering..
          
          
           NT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
          
          PRINCE PHILIP indicates she should put TONY on speaker-phone.
          The QUEEN obliges. TONY's voice comes out..
          

                                                                60.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   ...whether you'd seen any of today's
                   papers?
          
          The QUEEN looks at her desk. Most of the newspapers are
          strewn out in front of her..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   We've managed to look at one or two,
                   yes.
          
                               TONY
                   In which case, my next question would
                   be - whether you felt some kind of
                   response might be necessary?
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   No. I believe a few over-eager editors
                   are doing their best to sell
                   newspapers..and it would be a mistake
                   to dance to their tune.
          
                               TONY
                   Under normal circumstances I would
                   agree, but..P
                                RINCE PHILIP
                        (under his breath)
                   Here we go! The bloody flag again..!
          
          ELIZABETH indicates for PHILIP to be quiet..
          
                               TONY
                   ..my advisers have been taking the
                   temperature among people on the
                   streets - and the information I'm
                   getting is that the mood..
                        (choosing words carefully)
                   ...is quite delicate.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                        (under his breath)
                   Of course. That's where all the ruddy
                   cameras are.
          
           ELIZABETH gestures again for PHILIP to `SSSsshhh'..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   So what would you suggest, Prime
                   Minister? Some kind of statement?
          
                               TONY
                   No, Ma'am. I believe the moment for
                   statements has passed.
          
           TONY takes a deep breath..
          

                                                            61.
          
          
          
                               TONY
                   I would suggest flying the flag at
                   half-mast above Buckingham Palace...
          
          PRINCE PHILIP almost has an apoplexy..
          
                              PRINCE PHILIP
                   See!
          
                               TONY
                   And coming down to London at the
                   earliest opportunity.
          
          PHILIP stares in disbelief.."What?"
          
                               TONY
                   It would be a great comfort to your
                   people and would help them with their
                   grief.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   THEIR grief?
          
           he QUEEN exchanges a look with PHILIP..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   If you're suggesting that I drop
                   everything and come down to London
                   before I attend to two boys that have
                   just lost their mother..you're
                   mistaken.
          
                               RINCE PHILIP
                   Absurd..   E
                                ELIZABETH
                   I doubt there are many who know the
                   British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor
                   who has greater faith in their wisdom
                   and judgement. And it is my belief
                   that they will soon reject this `mood'
                   which has been stirred up by the
                   press...in favour of a period of
                   restrained grief, and sober, private
                   mourning.

                   That's the way we do things in this
                   country. Quietly. With dignity.
                        (a beat)
                   It's what the rest of the world has
                   always admired us for.
          
                               TONY
                   Well, if that's your decision, Ma'am,
                   of course the government will support
                   it.

                   Yes.

                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Bloody fool.
          
          He indicates the tea..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP

          INT. PRIVATE SECRETARY'S OFFICE - BALMORAL - SAME TIME
          
          JANVRIN speaks on the telephone to TONY BLAIR.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   Prime Minister, I understand how
                   `difficult' her behaviour must seem to
                   you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see
                   it from her perspective..
                        (searches for right words)
                   She's been brought up to believe its
                   God's will that she is who she is.
          
                                TONY
                   I think we should leave God out of it.
                   It's just not helpful.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   She won't have seen anything like this
                   since the Abdication.

                               JANVRIN(cont'd)
                   And I cannot emphasise enough what
                   affect that had on her. Unexpectedly
                   becoming King as good as killed her
                   father.
          
                                TONY
                   All right - but first we have to deal
                   with these terrible headlines. I'll
                   see what I can do with the Press.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.

                   But I can't promise anything. It's not
                   me they want to see.
          
          TONY hangs up, thinks, then..

          Tony comes out of his office and walks down the corridor to
          where the secretaries are.

                    nd cancel whatever I'm doing tonight.

          EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN drives out in her Land Rover. And into the
          countryside..
          
          
          EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY
          
          The Land Rover shakes and judders. The QUEEN bobs up and
          down. ESTATE WORKERS remove their hats as she drives past..
          
          
          EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY
          
          The roads have become rougher and narrower. The QUEEN drives
          with surprising confidence and ability. The QUEEN reaches a
          fork. She drives on, taking the right fork.
          

                                                               64.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN reaches the River Dee, then slows down. She stops
          and stares. Ahead of her is a difficult, quite perilous
          crossing.
          
           he QUEEN composes herself, visibly intimidated. A deep
          breath, then..
          
          She drives into the fast-moving river.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY
          
          The Land Rover's engine roars. The jeep rocks alarmingly side
          to side as it slowly crosses the river.
          
          One big rock after another. The QUEEN skilfully negotiates
          the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience..
          
          But ahead is one rock she hasn't seen..
          
          `Crreeak', the Land Rover's undercarriage hits the rock. The
          ugly sound of tearing metal.
          
           he QUEEN instinctively brakes, then sensing that was the
          wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator.
          The engine roars in protest, and..
          
          `Snap'. An ominous mechanical sound.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Oh..
          
          The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Oh, you are stupid.
          
          She tries to start the car again, but to no avail. No matter
          what she does, the Land Rover is stuck..
          
          The QUEEN looks into the glove box. Inside is a mobile
          telephone.

                   rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive.

          Rover's door.
          
          
          EXT. HIGHLANDS - RIVER DEE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN gingerly climbs out of the Land Rover, and walks
          across the stones to the river bank, getting her shoes wet.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
          
          The QUEEN sits on a stone by the stranded Land Rover. She
          sits in silence..
          
           othing but the sound of running water, wind in the trees,
          and birdsong.
          
          Ah, that's good.
          
           he QUEEN closes her eyes. All around her, silence except for
          the sounds of the great outdoors.
          

          
                                                               66.
          
          
          
          Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels
          like months. The QUEEN breathes deeply. It's all been a bit
          much.
          
           o time to think.
          
           ne shock after another.
          
           veryone shouting.
          
           ll far too dramatic.
          
           ome to think of it, this is the first time she's been able
          to..
          
          Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, we notice her shoulders are
          shaking. Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is
          happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying.
          W
           e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket
          pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes.
          Gradually, she composes herself.
          
          That's better.
          
           on't want to make a fuss.
          
           he GILLIES will be here soon.
          
          The QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better.
          
           resently the sound of rustling leaves, and the unmistakable
          sense that she is being watched. Strange..
          
          The QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup..
          
          Standing in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the
          STAG.
          
          The QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His
          antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have
          imagined.
          
          His fur is thick. His blaze across his nose is distinctive.
          He is vast, almost the size of a horse.
          
           nd staring at her. The QUEEN stares back.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Oh, you are a beauty.
          
          It is unprecedented - almost supernatural. No STAG ever
          willingly comes this close to humans.
          
           he QUEEN looks into his dark, brown eyes. An unmistakable
          connection between them..
          

                                                                67.
          
          
          
          It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind,
          the sound of trees bending. Then, ever so faintly, in the
          distance..
          
          The hum of approaching engines. It's the GILLIES coming to
          look for the QUEEN. Sensing this..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                        (indicating the STAG
                         should go)
                   Go. Go on. You'd better go..
          
          The STAG remains rooted to the spot..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                        (claps hands)
                   Go. Shoo. Go on.
          
          The ENGINES get closer and closer. The STAG takes a last look
          at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and
          walks off.
          
           o sooner has he disappeared into the woods, than..
          
          Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and
          GILLIES and EQUERRYS jump out, holding tow-ropes, waving in
          greeting and calling out, concerned for the QUEEN's safety..
          
          The QUEEN takes a last look in the direction of the STAG, to
          make sure he has gone, and smiles to herself.
          
           e's vanished. It's as if he was never there.

                                TONY
                   I know...but allowing her to hang
                   herself might not be in our best
                   interests either.

                   everyone's started to bully her.

          head-scarf and old raincoat on. DOGS barking excitedly..
          
          She is about to set off, when JANVRIN appears, breathlessly..

                   The Prime Minister for you, Ma'am.
          
          The QUEEN looks pained at the thought..
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

          comes into the kitchen, DOGS barking..
          
          COOKS and MAIDS doff their caps, bowing in respect, then run
          into hiding, as the telephone extension rings..
          
          The QUEEN picks it up..

          cup of tea. The QUEEN sits down..
          
          The DOGS duly follow suit. And sit.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     Yes, I have.
          
                                 TONY
                     Then I'm sure you'll agree. The
                     situation has become quite critical.
          
          TONY takes a breath. Knows this won't be easy.

                     Ma'am, a poll that's to be published
                     in tomorrow's paper suggests 70% of
                     people believe your actions have
                     damaged the monarchy and one in four
                     are now in favour of abolishing the

                   above Buckingham Palace and all other
                   Royal residences. Two - leave
                   Balmoral, and fly down to London at
                   the earliest opportunity. Three - pay
                   respects in person at Diana's coffin.
                   And four - make a statement via live
                   television to my people and the world.

                               ELIZABETH
                   Something's happened. There's been a
                   change...a shift of values..

                   people, isn't it time to hand over to
                   the next generation?
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Certainly not! Remember the oath you
                   took
          
                               ELIZABETH

                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   Damaging them? My dear, you are the
                   greatest asset this institution has.
                   One of the greatest it has EVER had.
                   The problem will come when you leave,
                   but that's not for you to worry about -
                   and certainly not today.

                               ELIZABETH
                   It's just no one seems to value
                   tradition or constancy any more.
                        (a beat)
                   It's all about show. About wearing
                   your heart on your sleeve.
          
                               QUEEN MOTHER
                   And you're not like that. Never have
                   been. No...you must show strength. Re-
                   assert your authority. You sit on the
                   most powerful throne in Europe. Head
                   of an unbroken line that goes back
                   more than a thousand years. How many
                   of your predecessors do you imagine
                   would have dropped everything and gone
                   down to London because people holding
                   candles wanted help with their grief?

          The QUEEN MOTHER's tirade continues, but the QUEEN is not
          listening. She knows she has a decision to make.

                   What? It's madness! The whole thing!
                   Bloody madness!
          
          Thunderous, Philip hangs up.
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP

                         the right words)

          of the WORLD's MEDIA whir and pop through the gates of
          Balmoral Castle.
          
          It's an eerie, venal image. An unmistakable echo of DIANA's
          world, and her last moments in Paris.
          
          The QUEEN, CHARLES, PHILIP, and the two PRINCES try not to
          show their hostility, and gingerly inspect the flowers laid
          at the gates of Balmoral..
          
          The QUEEN's face is grim set. Lips pursed. Visibly uneasy
          with the CAMERAS audibly whirring all around her.
          
          CHARLES holds his son's hand, and tries to concentrate on the
          flowers and wreathes and tributes.
          
            RINCE WILLIAM stares at the CAMERAS. Hostile,
          uncomprehending looks. The beginning of a lifelong animosity.
          Suddenly..
          `
           BANG' a passing motorbike's exhaust backfires. CHARLES jolts
          in shock, and flinches privately.
          

          
                                                                78.
          
          
          
          Clearly, his fears have not lessened. He's expecting the
          bullet at any moment..
          
          
           NT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR FAMILY FLAT - SAME TIME
          
          In the kitchen: CHERIE is feeding the kids supper at the
          kitchen table. The cheery chaos of family life. Everyone
          talking at once. Laughter. Teasing.
          
          Through an open door, we can see TONY in the sitting-room
          working. Shirt-sleeves, tie loosened..
          
          
          INT. BLAIR FLAT - SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME
          
          TONY sits with his feet up, doing his boxes, signing papers,
          and half watching television at the same time.
          
          ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their photo-call.
          The voice of the NEWS READER at Channel Four..
          
                               NEWS READER (ON T.V.)
                   We are just getting some pictures now
                   from Balmoral. These are rather
                   historic shots. Clearly the Queen has
                   responded to criticism that the Royal
                   Family is not engaged..
          T
           TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..
          
                               TONY
                        (to himself)
                   Thank God for that.
          
          From the kitchen: CHERIE's voice..
          
                               CHERIE (cont'd)
                   It's fish-fingers. Want any?
          
                               TONY
                   Be right there.
          
          TONY finishes signing the papers. Turns off the TV. Walks
          into the kitchen. We hear CHERIE's voice as the door closes..
          
                               CHERIE
                   I'm afraid they're a bit burned.
          
                                                           FADE TO BLACK
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL - DAY
          
          The PIPER SERGEANT walks around the castle perimeter playing
          the bag-pipes.
          

          
                                                               79.
          
          
          
          
          INT QUEENS BEDROOM - DAY
          
          The Queen is being dressed in black by her DRESSERS. Her Face
          apparently inscrutable. But the difficulty of the situation
          is clear.
          
          
          INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - BEDROOMS - VARIOUS - DAY
          
          The QUEEN comes downstairs to the first landing where bags
          are being brought out of the rooms by MAIDS and VALETS
                               P
                                RINCE PHILIP
                   Where are the boys? Have they already
                   left?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Yes. They left for London after
                   breakfast. With Charles.
          
           HILIP shakes his head..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   It's not right, you know
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Yes, but further discussion is no
                   longer helpful either.
          
          The QUEEN heads downstairs.   PHILIP follows...
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Oh, well. I suppose it gives the
                   ghillies time to find a new stag for
                   the boys now theirs has been shot.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   What?
          
          The QUEEN momentarily stiffens..
          
                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   Haven't you heard? It wandered onto
                   one of the neighbouring estates where
                   it was shot by one of the commercial
                   guests.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Really..?
          
          The blood has drained from her face..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Which estate?
          

                                                               80.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. BALMORAL - COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The QUEEN, pulling an old Barbour over her black dress,
          emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being
          loaded with bags for the trip.
          
          She climbs into a landrover, starts the engine.
          
          SECURITY MEN stare quizzically at one another, then leap into
          life and dash to their own cars to follow
          
          They drive out of the Balmoral Estate.
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR OFFICE - DAY
          
          TONY sits at his desk working on his speech. A knock on the
          door. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters..
          
                               CAMPBELL
                   Here's your box. There's some
                        (
                   important policy unit stuff on top.
                          a beat)
                   And you've seen the papers?
          
                               TONY
                        (snaps, irritated)
                   I'm the Prime Minister. Of course I've
                   seen the papers.
          
          ALASTAIR indicates the newspapers laid out on the table..
          
          'The Times': `PALACE BENDS THE KNEE TO BLAIR"
          
          'The Sun': "QUEEN CAVES IN ON PALACE FLAG".
          
          `The Express': "DOWNING STREET STEPS IN TO SAVE QUEEN".
          
          `The Mirror': "A QUIET WORD FROM TONY BLAIR AND THE NATION
          GETS ITS WISH".
          
                                LASTAIR
                        (in comic voice)
                   "Your Maj? Come down to London." "Who
                   says so?" "Tony Blair."
          
           LASTAIR reaches the door - sees TONY. Then..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   "Mr. Father of the Nation."
          
          ALASTAIR goes. TONY watches. Losing patience.
          

                                                                 81.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOURING CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
          
          The QUEEN's Land Rover, plus a protection vehicle, pulls up
          in a courtyard at Braemar Castle.
          
          The DRIVERS jump out. Go to open the doors for her..
          
          Working STALKERS and GHILLIES stop in their tracks, and
          double-take. Faces appear at windows. STABLE-HANDS, VISITORS
          and ESTATE STAFF stop and stare..
          
          We over hear whispers, `Bloody hell!' `It's her!'
          
          Presently, the HEAD GHILLIE appears in a doorway,
          deferentially straightening his hair, and clothes. He walks
          towards the QUEEN.
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   Morning, Ma'am. Is it his Lordship
                   you've come to see?
          H
           e reaches into his pockets for his cell-phone..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   No, no..please don't disturb him. I've
                   come on another matter. I hope you
                   don't mind..
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOURING ESTATE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN and HEAD GILLIE walk towards a circular cooling
          room. The HEAD GILLIE opens the door..
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOURING ESTATE - REFRIGERATED ROOM - DAY
          
          A large cooling room, where the shot animals are washed,
          disembowelled and cut up.
          
          Hanging in the centre of the room, his innards removed, blood
          draining onto the floor, is the STAG. A GAMEKEEPER, in
          overalls, is working on the carcass, when the door opens, and
          the QUEEN walks in.
          
           he GAMEKEEPER straightens. Stops what he's doing..
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   There he is..
          
          The QUEEN gasps in shock. Notices the GAMEKEEPER was about to
          begin the process of severing the STAG's head. The HEAD
          GILLIE, mistaking her reaction for admiration, smiles..
          

          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          
                               HEAD GILLIE (cont'd)
                   Yes, he's a beauty, isn't he? An
                   Imperial, Ma'am. Fourteen pointer.
          
           ut the QUEEN has not heard. She indicates a nasty wound..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                    e was wounded.
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   Yes. We got our guest in very close,
                   had him lined-up perfect, and still..
                         shrugs apologetically)
                   ..an investment banker, Ma'am. From
                   London.
          
          The QUEEN stretches her hand out, almost touches the wound..
          
                               HEAD GILLIE (cont'd)
                   I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow
                   him for miles - to finish him off.
          
                               ELIZABETH

                   Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.
          
          Unseen by others, the QUEEN's knuckles whiten..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Please pass my congratulations to your
                   guest.
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                   I will, Ma'am.
          
           he clears her throat, then goes..
          
                               HEAD GILLIE
                        (removing hat)
                   God bless you.
          
          The QUEEN goes. Dignified on the outside, but dying a
          thousand deaths underneath.

           n the table in between them are all the morning's NEWSPAPERS
          with their humiliating headlines.

          A shadow passes across her. The sound of a clearing throat.
          The QUEEN looks up. It's ROBIN JANVRIN. She snaps out of it.
                               E
                                  ELIZABETH
                   Yes, Robin..
          
          She puts on her glasses. Composure returns. Professional
          again.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   I've done a draft of your television

                   Thank you.
          
           ANVRIN puts it down. He notices all the NEWSPAPERS.
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Was there anything else?
          
          JANVRIN opens his mouth, wants to say something to comfort
          her..but realises it would be inappropriate.
          
                               JANVRIN
                   No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.

          ALASTAIR sits at his desk. A TV plays the footage of the
          QUEEN's car driving through the MALL..
          
          A SECRETARY walks in..
          
                               SECRETARY
                   I've got a copy of the Queen's speech.
          
          She passes it over to ALASTAIR..
          
                               SECRETARY
                   Shall I give Tony a copy?
          
                                LASTAIR
                   Let me have a look at it first.
          
          ALASTAIR starts reading it..
          

          
                                                                  84.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CAR - SAME TIME - ARCHIVE / RECONSTITUTED ARCHIVE
          
          The QUEEN and PHILIP stare out of the car. For the first
          time, they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the
          CROWDS..
          
                              PRINCE PHILIP
                        (jaw drops)
                   Good God..
          
          The QUEEN stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining
          the MALL. In places, the CROWDS are standing twenty deep.
          
           he FACES are reflected in the car windows. Are they hostile?
          Are they people she understands? Camera flashlights pop.
          
          
           NT. DOWNING STREET - ALASTAIR'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
          
          ALASTAIR makes a change to the Queen's speech. We CLOSE on
          the text as he writes, inserting...
          
                         "..speaking as a Grandmother"..
          
          In the background, on TV: we see the QUEEN's car pulls up.
          The doors open, the QUEEN gets out..
          
          Unaware her words are being edited by her Government.

           he QUEEN steps out into the crowds..
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - MONITORING ROOM - DAY
          
          TONY and several AIDES are watching the televisions.
          
          ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and PHILIP are looking at bouquets laid
          at the gates of the palace, reading messages and
          inscriptions..
          
          Candles are burning. Incense sticks. There are pictures of
          DIANA, and mini-shrines. Poems have been written.
          
           TONY watches intently. Behind him, the door opens and
          ALASTAIR enters..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   They sent a copy of the Queen's
                   speech.
          
          ALISTAIR holds it between finger and thumb..
          

          
                                                               85.

                   You might want to scrape the frost off
                   it first.
          
          ALASTAIR passes it to TONY..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   I made a couple of changes. So it
                   sounds like it comes from a human
                   being.
          
          ALASTAIR turns, walks towards the door..
          
                               ALASTAIR
                   Oh, and one bit of good news. The old
                   boot's FINALLY agreed to pay respects
                   at Diana's coffin.
          
          TONY spins round, eyes flashing in anger..
          
                               TONY
                   You know when you get it wrong, you
                   REALLY get it wrong.
                         a beat)
                   That woman has given her whole life in
                   service to her people - fifty years
                   doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job
                   she watched kill her father. She's
                   executed it with dignity, honour and,
                   as far as I can tell, without a single
                   blemish - and now we line up baying
                   for her blood - why? Because she's
                   struggling to lead the world in
                   mourning for a woman who threw
                   everything she offered back in her
                   face, and who seemed, in the last few
                   years, to be committed twenty-four
                   seven to destroy everything she holds
                   dear.

           TONY storms off.
          
          
          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
          
          The QUEEN continues to read the hand-written messages for
          DIANA, "We love you." "Rest with the angels, Diana". "You
          touched us with your love."
          
           nd also some which are downright hostile. "You were too good
          for them." "They have your blood on their hands."
          
           he QUEEN stares, visibly shocked, then..
          
          Behind her, a small GIRL approaches, holding a bouquet of
          flowers. She stops, in front of the QUEEN..
          
                            

                                                                 86.

                   Oh..hello.
          
           he LITTLE GIRL tries to curtsey..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   Would you like me to place them for
                   you?
          
                                LITTLE GIRL
                   No.
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Oh.
          
                               LITTLE GIRL
                   They're for you.

                        (visibly shocked)
                   For me..?
          
          The QUEEN is thrown. Suddenly looks utterly lost. Vulnerable,
          almost childlike. Her eyes are puffy and swollen, as though
          she is fighting tears..
          C
           ROWDS of MOURNERS watch intently. The QUEEN takes the
          flowers, then turns and walks away, visibly shaken..
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - DAY
          
          A television CREW is rigging lights in the Chinese Room in
          Buckingham Palace. JANVRIN enters and crosses the room.
          CAMERAS are being fixed to tripods..
          
          The QUEEN sits in a corner going through her speech.
          
                                ANVRIN
                   Your Majesty, there's a last minute
                   addition from Downing Street. They're
                   suggesting adding `..and as a
                   grandmother..' here.
          
                                ELIZABETH
                   Right.
          
          The QUEEN makes a note on the text..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   "So what I say to you now, as your
                   Queen and as a grandmother, I say from
                   my heart."
          
                               JANVRIN
                   You think you can say it?
          

          
                                                               87.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Do I have a choice?
          
          The QUEEN turns as SOUND RECORDERS fix a clip-mike to her
          dress.
          
                                IRECTOR
                   We're ready for you, your Majesty..
          
          The QUEEN gets up.
          
                               DIRECTOR
                   Just to confirm this is going out
                   live.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Right
          
                               DIRECTOR
                   And you'll be at the front of the six
                   o'clock news on all the channels
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I see.
          
          The QUEEN is led over to where the DIRECTOR has placed a
          chair and table in front of the cameras and lights..

          The QUEEN sits at her desk. Final touches from hair and make-
          up. The MALL is clearly visible. The QUEEN holds the speech
          in front of her..
          
                               DIRECTOR (cont'd)

          We close on the QUEEN's face, and..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Since last Saturday's dreadful news we
                   have seen, throughout Britain and the
                   world, an overwhelming expression of
                   sadness at Diana's death..

                               ELIZABETH
                   We have all been trying in our
                   different ways to cope. The initial
                   shock is often succeeded by a mixture
                   of other feelings. Disbelief,
                   incomprehension, anger and concern for
                   those who remain.
          
          
          INT. DOWNING STREET - SAME TIME
          
          TONY and CHERIE BLAIR watch from their apartment..
          
                               ELIZABETH (ON TV)
                   We have all felt these emotions in
                   these last few days. So what I say to
                   you now, as your Queen and as a
                   grandmother, I say from my heart...
          
          TONY flinches in sympathy as she says the line. CHERIE
          notices this, then..
          
                               CHERIE
                   "Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't
                   mean a word of this.
          
                               TONY
                   That's not the point. What she's doing
                   is extraordinary.
                        (points to the TV)
                   That's how you survive.
          
          CHERIE turns, and stares..
          
                               CHERIE
                   Listen to you! A week ago you were the
                   great moderniser, making speeches
                   about the "People's Princess", now
                   you've gone weak at the knees.
          
          TONY bristles with irritation..
          
                               CHERIE
                   I don't know why I'm surprised. In the
                   end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga-
                   ga for her Maj.
          
                               ELIZABETH (ON TV)
                   I hope that tomorrow we can all,
                   wherever we are, join in expressing
                   our grief at Diana's loss, and
                   gratitude for her all-too-short life.
          

                                                                  89.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME
          
          The QUEEN draws to a close. Her face is inscrutable. The
          DIRECTOR prepares his CREW to wind up..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   May those who died rest in peace and
                   may we, each and every one of us..
          
          CLOSE-UP OF THE QUEEN:
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   ..thank God for someone who made many,
                   many people happy.
          
          The QUEEN holds her expression for the camera. Then..
          
                               DIRECTOR
                        (calls out)
                   And we're out..!
          
          The QUEEN's face relaxes. As does everyone in the room. A
          huge, collective breathing out.
                               D
                                IRECTOR (cont'd)
                   Thank you, your Majesty.
          
          But the QUEEN doesn't acknowledge him. She removes her clip-
          mike, and hands it to the DIRECTOR..
          
          ..then walks over to a waiting PRINCE PHILIP, who
          protectively extends an arm. The QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP
          leave the room. People are left staring awkwardly at one
          another..
          
          OVER THIS: we FADE IN the sound of a haunting, elegiac hymn..

          A soloist sings "Libera me, Domine" from Verdi's Requiem, in

          GUESTS, (including TOM CRUISE, TON HANKS, NICOLE KIDMAN and

                                                       SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
          
          
          CAPTION: `TWO MONTHS LATER'
          
          
           NT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR'S FLAT - EVENING
          
          The face of TONY BLAIR stares back from a bathroom mirror.
          CHERIE is proudly tying his tie. Checking his appearance.
          
          We're in the family apartment above 11, Downing Street.
          CHERIE puts the finishing touches to his appearance..
          
          We notice her appearance has become even more stylish. Gone
          is her spiky hair. And the rough edges. Every inch the First
          Lady. They've both come a long way in a short time.
          
                               CHERIE
                   So? Off to see your girlfriend?
          
                                TONY
                   Now, now..
          
                               CHERIE
                   I hope she shows you some respect this
                   time. It's quite a debt of gratitude
                   she owes you.
          
          CHERIE straightens his tie..
          
                               CHERIE
                   Mr "Saviour of the Monarchy."
          
                                 TONY
                       doubt she'll see it that way.
          
          
           XT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - COURTYARD - EVENING
          
          TONY's motorcade sweeps into Buckingham Palace. Doors are
          opened by his PROTECTION OFFICERS.
          
           TONY steps out to be greeted by the waiting JANVRIN..
          
                               TONY
                   Robin. Good to see you.
          

                                                                 91.
          
          
          
                                 JANVRIN
                     Prime Minister.
          
                                 TONY
                          (his most winning smile)
                     Tony, please..
          
          JANVRIN allows himself a private smile..
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - EVENING
          
          TONY BLAIR and the EQUERRY walk along the corridor, and reach
          the door.
          
           TONY shoots his cuffs. Clears his throat. The EQUERRY knocks.
          
          
          INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - EVENING
          
          TONY and the EQUERRY enter. Both bow from the neck..
          
                                 EQUERRY
                     The Prime Minister, Ma'am.
          
          TONY walks forward and meets the QUEEN, who, like JANVRIN,
          barely smiles, doesn't make eye contact, shakes his hand, and
          indicates a seat..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                     Do sit down.
          
                                  TONY
                     Thank you.
          
           TONY sits, and stares at the QUEEN. Her face is inscrutable.
                               T
                                  TONY
                     It's good to see you again. After
                     quite a summer..
          
          The QUEEN's face. Stiffens.
          
                                 TONY (cont'd)
                     I'm referring to your visit to India
                     and Pakistan, where your comments
                     about ending historic disagreements
                     went down very well.
          
           ilence.
          
                                 TONY (cont'd)
                     And the Commonwealth Heads of
                     Government Meeting. I spoke to the
                     Prime Minister of Malawi, who was
                     saying how much he appreciated your
                     tough stance on Nigeria.
          

          
                                                               92.
          
          
          
          Silence.
          
                                  TONY
                      I meant to tell you at the time but
                      you were being monopolised rather.
          
           ilence.
          
                                  TONY
                      I imagine those occasions are quite
                      difficult. Twenty-four heads of
                      Government each clamouring for a
                      private audience..
          
          Silence. TONY takes a deep breath, then..
          
                                  TONY
                      Also, we haven't had a chance to speak
                      since THAT week. And I wanted to offer
                      my apologies..
          
          The QUEEN looks up..
          
                                  ELIZABETH
                      Whatever for?
          
                                  TONY
                      In case you'd felt `manhandled' or
                      `managed' in any way.
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                      Not at all.
          
              beat.
          
                                  ELIZABETH
                      I don't think I shall ever understand
                      what happened this summer.
          
                                    TONY
                      The circumstances were exceptional,
                      Ma'am. And in the end, you showed
                      great personal strength, courage, and
                      humility.   E
                                   ELIZABETH
                       ou're confusing humility with
                      humiliation.
          
                                   TONY
                      That's not true.
          
                                   ELIZABETH
                      You didn't hear what they were saying
                      in the Mall that Friday.
          

          
                                                                 93.
          
          
          
                                    TONY
                        I still believe History will show it
                        was a good week for you.
          
                                     ELIZABETH
                        And an even better one for you, Mr
                        Blair.
          
                                    TONY
                        But there are fifty-two weeks in a
                        year, Ma'am. And two and a half
                        thousand in a half century.
          
          The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment..
          
                                    TONY
                        And when people come to assess your
                        legacy, no one will remember those few
                        days.
          
                                       ELIZABETH
                        Really?
          
          
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                        You don't feel that what respect or
                        affection people might once have had
                        for..
          
          She wants to say `Me', but instead says..
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                        ..this institution has been
                        diminished?
          
                                      TONY
                        Not at all.
          
              pause..
          
                                    ELIZABETH
                        I gather some of your closest advisors
                        were less fulsome in their support..
          
                                     TONY
                        One or two. But as a leader one
                        has...a different perspective.
                              a beat)
                        I could never have added my voice to
                        the chorus.
          
                                     ELIZABETH
                        You're very kind.
          
          The QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow..
          

          
                                                               94.
          
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   But let's also not forget the more
                   pragmatic reason.
          
                               TONY
                   Which is?
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   That without me there to distract
                   everyone, it'd suddenly become
                   embarrassingly clear how much
                   unchecked power the British Prime
                   Minister actually has.
          
           TONY looks up..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   If fifty years of doing MY job has
                   taught me anything, it is that the
                   people doing YOURS generally prefer me
                   with all my faults to some kind of
                   meddling President..
                        (a beat)
                   Just look at the French.
          
          The QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading
          glasses..            E
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I suppose we'd better get on with the
                   business in hand..
          
          The QUEEN looks out of the window. Notices how the sun is
          setting..
          
                               ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I do love this time of day. Shall we
                   walk while there's still some sunshine
                   left? I do hope you're a walker.
          
                               TONY
                   I am.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   Good. The clocks go back next week,
                   then it'll be dark by five.
          
          TONY and the QUEEN get to their feet.
          
                                ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   I always think these meetings stand a
                   better chance of succeeding if the
                   Prime Minister is a walker.
          
          FOOTMEN open the door as TONY and the QUEEN go out of the
          Audience Room, and into..
          
                                                                  95.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CORRIDOR - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
          
          BLAIR and the QUEEN turns a corner, and emerge into a
          corridor from the audience room...
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   As a matter of fact, it's how I think
                   best. On my feet. I've never been one
                   for sitting around endlessly. A good
                   walk and fresh air sorts everything
                   out..
          
          Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been
          holding something back..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   One in four, you said? Wanted to get
                   rid of me? T
          
                                TONY
                   For about half an hour. But then you
                   came down to London and all that went
                   away.
          
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I've never been hated like that
                   before.
          
                               TONY
                   No. And that must have been difficult.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   It was. Very.
          
          They begin walking again..
          
                                 ELIZABETH
                   Ever since Diana people want glamour
                   and tears..the grand performance..and
                   I'm not very good at that. I prefer to
                   keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly
                   I believed that's what people wanted
                   from their Queen. Not to make a fuss
                   nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve,
                   duty first... self second.
          
          The QUEEN stops..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   It's how I was brought up. It's all
                   I've ever known
          
                               TONY
                   One forgets. You were so young when
                   you became Queen.
          

                                                                96.
          
          
          
          The QUEEN drifts off..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   I was. A girl.
          
          Then pulls herself back..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   But I can see the world has changed.
                   And one must 'modernise'.
          
                               TONY
                   Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   (with a twinkle as they set off)
                   Don't get ahead of yourself Prime-
                   minister, I think you'll find that I'm
                   supposed to be advising YOU!

          The corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he
          surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow.
          The QUEEN smiles..
          
          
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
          
          FOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens.
          The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out..
          
                               ELIZABETH
                   So...what might we expect in your
                   first Parliament?
          
          TONY clears his throat, then..
          
                               TONY
                   Well, Ma'am, top of the list is
                   education reform. We want to radically
                   reduce classroom sizes...
          
          Our CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the
          QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance...
          
          Time has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints.

          forgotten..

Raging Bull - by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin 

 

 
	MUSIC IN: "Stone Cold Dead in the Market" by Louis Jordon
	
	THE TITLES appear on black. They are intercut with CLOSE-UPS
	of a fighter's body.
	
	EXAMPLES:
	
	Feet move.
	
	Credit over black.
	
	Body lunges.
	
	Credit over black.
	
	Fists swing and punch at the air.
	
	Credit over black.
	
	WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.
	
	                                   THEN CUT TO:
	
	INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
	
	JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
	
	We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
	shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
	balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
	canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
	bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
	
	               JAKE
	     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	     It's a thrill to be standing here
	     talking to you wonderful people. In
	     fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
	     I haven't seen so many people since
	     my last fight at Madison Square
	     Garden. After that fight, a
	     reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
	     you go from here?' I said, 'To a
	     hospital!' I fought one hundred and
	     six professional fights and still
	     none of them bums figured out how
	     to fight me -- they kept hitting me
	     in the head! And that's why I'm
	     here tonight...
	          (starts to sing)
	     'When the fighter's not engaged in
	     his employment, his employment,
	     although he was Champ and quite the
	     rage, he must go somewhere else to
	     seek employment, seek employment.
	     But a fighter's life is not a bowl
	     of cherries, still I'd rather have
	     an egg than a fist upon my face...
	     That's Entertainment!'
	
	INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
	
	Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,
	19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter
	how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always
	staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
	
	Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
	
	It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.
	Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --
	each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
	
	Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER
	and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
	
	AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
	blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
	him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
	
	               JOEY
	     You didn't have to come to
	     Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan
	     yan," Jake!
	
	               TONY
	     He's got you, Jake! You're
	     outpointed! You're coming up for
	     the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
	
	The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and
	charges at REEVES.
	
	REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
	
	In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
	
	               JOEY
	     A grand apiece! We got a grand
	     apiece on this, Jake! A fucking
	     grand!
	
	JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild
	alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
	
	The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
	
	REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
	
	The REFEREE counts:
	
	               REFEREE
	     One, two, three, four...
	
	The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the
	underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and
	steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending
	not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a
	few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
	not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
	count of nine, ending the match.
	
	Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
	get their money.
	
	JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting
	them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
	
	The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:
	
	               ANNOUNCER
	     Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,
	     under the rules of the Cleveland
	     Boxing Commission, after ten
	     rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy
	     Reeves.
	
	The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to
	lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS
	bring in a stretcher.
	
	JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to
	figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and
	the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting
	with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.
	PEOPLE go into the ring.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Jake)
	     Don't get out of the ring. You won
	     the fight -- let him go out first.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	REEVES being placed on the stretcher.
	
	A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to
	play the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.
	
	Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.
	
	EXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY
	
	It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare
	cases and street kids.
	
	In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange
	words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY
	and JOEY turn the corner.
	
	               JOEY
	     Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
	     Let's say that's the truck; it's
	     full of cigarettes, right? Now, two
	     o'clock this morning we move the
	     truck from here to there,
	          (he points; the CAMERA
	          PANS)
	     take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,
	     make some cash.
	
	               SALVY
	     Hey but Joey, you're thinking
	     nickels and dimes. The money's with
	     your brother.
	
	               JOEY
	     What do you want from my life,
	     Salvy? He's my brother.
	
	               SALVY
	     He ain't doin' the right thing.
	     He's makin' beans compared to what
	     he should be makin'. Can't you make
	     him understand that?
	
	A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to cop)
	     Hey, leave the kids alone.
	
	               SALVY
	     Get lost.
	          (joking, he knows the Cop)
	     Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."
	     Remember that, "A rat."
	
	The KIDS yell.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Cop)
	     Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your
	     trouble. There's some bums around
	     the corner -- they need your help.
	
	               COP
	     Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself
	     a new suit.
	
	               JOEY
	          (laughs)
	     Here's my new suit.
	          (grabs his crotch)
	     Right here.
	
	               COP
	     Hey, don't get wise!
	
	               JOEY
	     Just kidding, take it easy.
	          (to himself)
	     No fuckin' sense of humor.
	
	SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
	
	JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits
	at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while
	his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
	
	JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
	
	               JAKE
	     This looks done.
	
	               IRMA
	     It's not done.
	
	               JAKE
	     It looks done. I'll take it the way
	     it is.
	
	               IRMA
	     Here's your steak. You can't wait
	     for it to be done. Here.
	
	She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the
	stove.
	
	               IRMA (CONT'D)
	     Here's your carrots. You're in such
	     a hurry. You can't wait.
	
	               JAKE
	     No, I can't wait. You know when I
	     wait? When it's important to wait.
	     It's not important to wait for no
	     steak. It's important to wait for
	     Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't
	     important to wait for no steak! I
	     won that fight. So, I stayed in the
	     ring, and that way I made sure
	     everybody knew it. I shoulda
	     knocked him out earlier,
	     sonofabitch.
	
	He starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell
	     you, if this steak was the
	     middleweight championship, I'd show
	     you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw.
	     I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it
	     before it came out of the cow --
	     that's how I'd wait.
	
	EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY
	
	SALVY and JOEY approach the building.
	
	               JOEY
	     I can't convince him. He's got such
	     a thick head, I'd like to crack it
	     open myself. Believe me, my own
	     brother. It's very hard. You don't
	     have to convince me -- I know we
	     should be with Tommy. You talk to
	     him. He don't listen to nobody.
	
	               SALVY
	     Look, I'm just tellin' you how
	     Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard
	     on himself. Tommy wants him with
	     us. It's as simple as that.
	
	They stop at the doorway.
	
	               SALVY (CONT'D)
	     Talk some sense into him, will ya?
	     You're still his brother.
	     If he ain't gonna listen to you, he
	     ain't gonna listen to nobody!
	
	               JOEY
	     All right, I'll try. See you later.
	
	               SALVY
	     Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
	
	               JOEY
	     Right, the gym.
	
	SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
	
	JOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.
	
	               JOEY
	          (noticing Jake)
	     What's the matter?
	
	               IRMA
	     He's doing it again.
	
	               JOEY
	          (goes to Jake)
	     What's the matter? You're drinking.
	     You're eating like an animal.
	
	JOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink
	in his hand, and tears on his face.
	
	               JOEY (CONT'D)
	     What's wrong?
	
	               JAKE
	          (gets up)
	     Nothing...
	
	JAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY
	follows JAKE.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM
	
	JOEY walks up to JAKE.
	
	               JOEY
	     Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
	
	               JAKE
	          (privately, to Joey)
	     I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis,
	     that's what's the matter.
	
	               JOEY
	     What're you talking about? He's a
	     heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
	
	JAKE holds out his scarred hands.
	
	               JAKE
	     Look at these hands. These fuckin'
	     hands. I was born with a girl's
	     hands. And even if I put on enough
	     weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be
	     too slow to fight. No matter how
	     big I get, I'll never be big enough
	     to fight Louis.
	
	JAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.
	
	               JOEY
	     That's what I'm sayin'. You
	     shouldn't even think like that.
	     It's crazy.
	
	               JAKE
	     I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll
	     never be big enough to fight Louis,
	     but I know Joey, I know...
	
	               JOEY
	     You know?
	
	               JAKE
	     Yeah. Do me a favor.
	
	               JOEY
	     Sure. What is it?
	
	               JAKE
	     Hit me in the face.
	
	               JOEY
	          (after a pause)
	     You want me to do what?
	
	               JAKE
	     You heard me, I said hit me.
	
	               JOEY
	     C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your
	     best shot. On the jaw.
	
	               JOEY
	     Jack, I got no gloves.
	
	               JAKE
	          (grabs a nearby towel)
	     Here's your glove.
	
	JOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE
	with his right. JAKE holds fast.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Go ahead. Hit me. C'mon, don't
	     worry about it. I want you to hit
	     me with everything you got.
	
	JOEY hauls off and lands him a real belt. JAKE rolls with it
	and stands firm.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Again. Harder.
	
	JOEY hits him again.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Harder. Go 'head.
	
	JOEY hits him again.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Harder.
	          (grabs the towel)
	     Take the towel off.
	
	               JOEY
	     Jack! Enough!
	
	               JAKE
	     Go ahead.
	
	JOEY hits him again. JAKE holds fast. JAKE starts to walk
	away.
	
	               JOEY
	     What was that for? I know you can
	     take punches. I can hit you from
	     now to doomsday. What the fuck does
	     that prove?
	
	               JAKE
	     See that, I don't feel it. I can
	     take it. I know I can take anybody.
	
	EXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY
	
	Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street
	and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
	
	Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door
	listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is
	posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
	
	INT. GLEASON'S - DAY
	
	Gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags.
	About a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's.
	For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the
	workouts.
	
	JAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working
	out for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round.
	JAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound
	again.
	
	At that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON"
	MEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter
	the gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits,
	flashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the
	door. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to
	the ring.
	
	               SALVY
	          (waves)
	     Hey Joey --
	
	JOEY waves back.
	
	               SALVY (CONT'D)
	          (waves again)
	     Jake, how you doin'?
	
	JAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that
	he's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same
	and becomes a bit nervous.
	
	SALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like
	to. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.
	
	JAKE goes to JOEY's corner.
	
	               JAKE
	     Did you know they were coming up
	     here?
	
	JOEY doesn't answer.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Answer me when I talk to you.
	
	               JOEY
	     Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to
	     talk to you. So I...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Don't ever bring those kids up here
	     again! I'm working out, I'm killin'
	     myself in here, and they walk
	     around like they fuckin' own the
	     neighborhood.
	
	SALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They
	begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
	
	The bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners
	JOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block
	them. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
	
	The bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start
	to leave.
	
	               SALVY
	          (to Joey)
	     Hey Joey, we better go. See you
	     later.
	
	JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're
	     your friends.
	
	JAKE watches them leave.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he
	     think he is? I'm gonna let that
	     fuckin' hard-on come up here and
	     act like a big shot.
	
	               JOEY
	     What are you getting so hot about --
	     Tommy Como told him to come down
	     here...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como.
	     I don't care about Jesus Christ on
	     the fuckin' cross. I gotta give
	     them a percentage of what I make!
	     I'm in here breaking my ass, not
	     them. Don't ever bring them up here
	     again.
	
	               JOEY
	     I didn't tell them to come. Tommy
	     Como...
	
	The bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body
	punches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of
	punches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs.
	
	               JAKE
	     That's right, fight back. I got
	     laid three times before I came up
	     here this morning and I can still
	     break your ass.
	
	JOEY fights back, but it's no use.
	
	               JOEY
	     You cocksucker.
	
	JAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY
	watches unseen from the doorway.
	
	EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
	
	The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the
	closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot
	fence stands between the pool and the street.
	
	JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the
	"BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A
	young FAN walks by and says:
	
	               FAN
	     Hey, Jake.
	
	At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and
	sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl,
	about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.
	
	SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS.
	They joke with JOEY.
	
	JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.
	
	JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE
	giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.
	
	               JAKE
	          (referring to Vickie)
	     Who's that?
	
	               JOEY
	     Whadda you care?
	
	               JAKE
	     Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who
	     is she? What's a matter? You afraid
	     I'm gonna take her on you?
	
	               JOEY
	     No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna
	     meet her?
	
	               JAKE
	     Yeah --
	
	               JOEY
	     Cause I'll go right over there and
	     bring her here.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go 'head.
	
	               JOEY
	     You sure you wanna meet her? Don't
	     make me go over there, you change
	     your mind and you make me look bad,
	     cause she's really a knockout.
	     She's 15, this kid -- a great piece
	     of ass.
	
	               JAKE
	     How do you know? You know her that
	     good?
	
	               JOEY
	     No, I see her around the pool. I
	     know her. I know her like that --
	     not like that.
	
	               JAKE
	          (gesturing to his bandage)
	     Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I
	     don't feel right...
	
	JAKE watches VICKIE.

	               JOEY
	          (to Jake)
	     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
	     know she'll be there.
	
	               JAKE
	     'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
	
	               JOEY
	     How you gonna catch anybody alone
	     at a dance?... I don't know if
	     she'll be there alone... She'll
	     probably be there with her
	     girlfriends or something.
	
	               JAKE
	     She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
	
	               JOEY
	     Nah, she don't go with nobody.
	     She's only 15 years old.
	
	               JAKE
	     What does that have to do with it?
	     She don't look 15 to me. I heard
	     somethin' with Salvy. She was with
	     him once or somethin', I think. It
	     was like some blonde. That's the
	     one...
	
	               JOEY
	     Probably. You know she talks to
	     everybody, and not just him.
	
	               JAKE
	     Yeah, she's nice.
	
	               JOEY
	     Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin'
	     you.
	
	               JAKE
	     You wasn't with her, were you?
	
	               JOEY
	     Huh?
	
	               JAKE
	     You wasn't with her?
	
	               JOEY
	     With her? How?
	
	               JAKE
	     You know, like bang her or
	     anything?
	
	               JOEY
	     Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I
	     know her from around here, that's
	     all. You want to meet her or what?
	
	               JAKE
	     Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons
	     around. I'll wait. Not now.
	
	The scene ends on VICKIE as JAKE watches her.

	               JOEY
	          (to Jake)
	     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
	     know she'll be there. Dressed up
	     and everything.
	
	               JAKE
	     I don't like all those other clowns
	     around. That's all I know.
	
	               JOEY
	     C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna
	     get outa here tonight.
	
	JOEY sips a drink as JAKE knots his tie. IRMA enters from the
	bedroom.
	
	               IRMA
	     Where you going at this hour?
	
	               JAKE
	     What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out --
	     business.
	
	               IRMA
	     You fuckin' worm, if you're going
	     out, I'm going out.
	
	               JAKE
	     And where you goin'?
	
	               IRMA
	     None of your fuckin' business.
	
	JOEY lifts his eyes up.
	
	               JAKE
	     Eh, go out. Do what you're gonna
	     do. What do I care?
	
	JOEY opens the door to leave. JAKE follows.
	
	               IRMA
	     That's right -- run out. I ain't
	     gonna be here when you get back.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
	
	JAKE and JOEY hurry down the stairs. IRMA shouts after them.
	
	               IRMA
	     Bunch of guys. You all hang out
	     together. Yeah, you're all going
	     out on business. You're all gonna
	     suck each other off.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - LATE NIGHT
	
	               JOEY
	     What a mouth on her -- you shoulda
	     hit her -- no good fuckin' Jewish
	     cunt -- breakin' our balls. You
	     shoulda hit her with a chair.
	
	               JAKE
	     Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk
	     like that. She's still my wife.
	
	               JOEY
	     No, but Jake... how much abuse can
	     you take.
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     How many times do I have to hit
	     her? I hit her enough.
	
	They exit to street.
	
	EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - STREET - LATE NIGHT
	
	JOEY and JAKE come out of the building and start walking down
	the street.
	
	IRMA opens the window on the second floor right above them,
	and shouts out to them:
	
	               IRMA
	     Go ahead -- that's all you're good
	     for -- to go out and leave me here
	     like a dog. You and your brother!
	     You don't even look like brothers.
	     You look like faggots! That's what
	     you look like -- faggots!
	
	JAKE and JOEY walk faster down the block, pretending that
	IRMA must be shouting at someone else.
	
	She throws a bottle at them. It smashes in the street.
	
	EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT (AN HOUR LATER)
	
	ESTABLISHING SHOT.
	
	INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
	
	A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing
	while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS
	present. The younger people are divided into two groups --
	the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most
	of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in
	evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing
	together.
	
	Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS."
	There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles
	of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables
	are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood
	groups, as if they were street corners.
	
	JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young
	neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk
	to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.
	
	JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This
	little game goes on for a few seconds, then:
	
	               JOEY
	     Look, could you move a little.
	     Would you mind, darling?
	
	               VERA
	     Mind what, Mr. Big Shot?
	
	               JAKE
	          (annoyed)
	     Eh, girlie, take a walk.
	
	JAKE starts to move forward; JOEY stops him.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Vera)
	     All right, darling, I'll just stand
	     here and wait.
	
	JOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals,
	covers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past
	her. JOEY smiles.
	
	JOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table.
	
	               JAKE
	     Do you see her yet?
	
	               JOEY
	     Give me a chance. Let me look.
	
	MOVING SHOTS
	
	JAKE tries to find her -- Camera pans until we find her. JOEY
	points out a distant table. He spots VICKIE with a couple of
	other GIRLS . VICKIE locks beautiful and is obviously having
	a good time.
	
	               JOEY (CONT'D)
	     THERE she is over there on the
	     other side. What did I tell you?
	     Oh, ain't she nice? Ain't she a
	     fuckin' doll?
	
	As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV:
	
	SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They
	are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are
	obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood
	dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with
	them. They get up to leave.
	
	               JAKE
	     Be right back.
	
	SALVY, FRANKIE, JUNIOR, VTCKIE and the other TWO GIRLS leave
	the dance hall. JAKE, unseen, follows them to the entrance
	way, as they go out onto the sidewalk.
	
	EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
	
	JAKE watches as SALVY ushers everyone into his Cadillac, and
	then drives off.
	
	JAKE stares after the car for a moment, then goes back
	inside.
	
	EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
	
	JAKE and JOEY get out of their Packard convertible and walk
	over to the fence surrounding the pool. VICKIE is by the
	pool.
	
	               JOEY
	          (calling out to Vickie)
	     Hey, Vickie, c'mere. Don't be
	     afraid. C'mere. Just say hello.
	     This is my brother.
	
	VICKIE comes over to the fence.
	
	               JOEY (CONT'D)
	     Vickie, I want you to meet my
	     brother, Jake. He's gonna be the
	     next champ.
	
	JAKE puts his fingers through the fence.
	
	               JAKE
	     Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is
	     that right? You wanted to meet me?
	
	               VICKIE
	          (to Joey)
	     I just wanted to say hello.
	
	               JAKE
	     You wanted to say hello, eh? I
	     can't believe it. When did you fall
	     outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you
	     you're the most beautiful one here,
	     princess of the pool. You got a
	     baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha
	     wanna meet me for?
	
	               VICKIE
	     I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
	
	               JAKE
	          (to Joey)
	     Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face
	     is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now?
	     You wanna go for a ride?
	
	PAN to car.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Sure. Gimme a few minutes.
	
	She starts to go.
	
	               JAKE
	     Hey...
	
	She turns. JAKE kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence
	by her lips.
	
	EXT. SHORE ROAD - DAY
	
	JAKE drives his Packard convertible down Shore Road. VICKIE
	sits in the passenger seat, her blonde hair blowing in the
	wind. VICKIE feels JAKE's eyes all over her, and loves it.
	
	On the radio, Bing Crosby sings "Just One More Charce."
	
	EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY
	
	JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf
	course on Shore Road. The Shore Road course is one of the
	best. The first green features a pink windmill.
	
	JAKE and VICKIE get out to cross the street.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You don't talk very much.
	
	               JAKE
	     I ain't ever talked to a movie star
	     before.
	
	               VICKIE
	          (giggles)
	     I ain't no movie star. I'm just in
	     high school.
	
	               JAKE
	     Oh no? I thought you was a movie
	     star.
	
	A bus heads toward them.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake! The bus!
	
	JAKE holds up his hand.
	
	               JAKE
	     Any bus gives you trouble, I knock
	     it out for ya.
	
	The bus stops for them as they cross the street.
	
	EXT. THE FIRST GREEN - DAY
	
	JAKE sets VICKIE's ball on the tee facing the windmill.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You go first. Let me watch how to
	     do this.
	
	               JAKE
	     You don't get nothin' done by
	     watchin'. You just gotta do it.
	     Here, I'll help you.
	
	JAKE hands VICKIE the putter, then moves behind her and puts
	her hand on the club.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     That's it. Just grip up a little
	     tighter. That's it. You're gonna be
	     real good at this. How does that
	     feel?
	
	               VICKIE
	     It feels real good.
	
	               JAKE
	     Just keep your eye on the ball.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Should I hit it?
	
	               JAKE
	     Just give it a nice little tap.
	
	VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the
	windmill. VICKIE breaks free and follows her ball. JAKE
	follows.
	
	               VICKIE
	     I can't find my ball.
	
	               JAKE
	     Can you see it?
	
	VICKIE bends and looks under the windmill.
	
	               VICKIE
	     No.
	
	JAKE bends and looks.
	
	               VICKIE (CONT'D)
	     Can you see it?
	
	               JAKE
	     No.
	
	               VICKIE
	     What does that mean?
	
	JAKE takes VICKIE by the arm.
	
	               JAKE
	     It means the game is over.
	
	JAKE throws his putter on the next green.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Let's get outa here.
	
	EXT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING - BRONX - DAY
	
	JAKE and VICKIE pull up to a tenement.
	
	JAKE dashes around the car to open the door for VICKIE.
	
	They enter the building.
	
	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY
	
	JOSEPH LAMOTTA, SR. is finishing his Sunday dinner with a
	glass of wine as JAKE and VICKIE enter.
	
	               JAKE
	     Hi Pop. This is my new girlfriend,
	     Vickie. V for victory. How do you
	     like that Pop?
	
	               JOE LAMOTTA
	     V for victory.
	
	               VICKIE
	          (nervous)
	     It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.
	     LaMotta.
	
	               JOE LAMOTTA
	          (in Italian)
	     Sit down. Eat something.
	
	JAKE is anxious. VICKIE is scared.
	
	               JAKE
	     C'mon, Pop. You've been in America
	     so many years. Speak English.
	
	               JOE LAMOTTA
	          (joking)
	     You want me to speak English --
	     Fuck you. That's English.
	
	               JAKE
	     Pop, don't curse. There's a girl
	     here. I'm gonna show her around the
	     house. Why don't you just finish
	     your wine?
	
	JOE stares at him. JAKE grasps VICKIE's arm firmly.
	
	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
	
	The bedroom is a few rooms away from the kitchen. JAKE closes
	the door. (There is a warm light in the bedroom.)
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake, this is your father's
	     bedroom.
	
	               JAKE
	     That's all right. He don't mind.
	
	The room is sparsely furnished. On the bureau, there is a
	large framed photo of the boxing brothers: JAKE and JOEY
	LAMOTTA. (JOEY wears a suit in the picture.)
	
	JAKE puts VICKIE on the bed and removes his jacket and tie.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake...
	
	               JAKE
	     It's OK.
	
	He pushes her against the bed and gently undresses her. They
	make love.
	
	INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 5, 1943)
	
	JAKE is fighting SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. (It's their 2nd match.)
	WE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously,
	but SUGAR RAY is a formidable opponent. AN ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	gives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of
	punishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE
	nails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and
	pounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right
	cross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a
	left to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the
	ropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.
	SUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,
	while the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.
	
	TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the winner.
	JAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.
	
	INT. GLEASON'S - DAY (1943)
	
	JAKE's press conference.
	
	FIVE REPORTERS meander around the gym, waiting for JAKE to
	finish sparring. They are not thrilled with their assignment.
	JAKE is not thrilled with having them there.
	
	The gallery is spotted with the usual BRONX TYPES. The lone
	exception is VICKIE, dressed very well, very sensual, and
	quite content to watch JAKE make his SPARRING PARTNERS' lives
	miserable, despite their head and belly protectors.
	
	JOEY is off in one of the corners arguing with ONE of the
	REPORTERS:
	
	               JOEY
	     The fuckin' papers are full of
	     Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and
	     Jake knocked him clear outa the
	     ring in Detroit. He's the only guy
	     ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa
	     matter with you? I thought we had
	     an arrangement.
	
	               REPORTER
	     We do Joey. You know we do.
	
	               JOEY
	     You holding me up for more cash or
	     what?
	
	The bell sounds, ending the sparring round.
	
	               REPORTER
	     I can't print nothing if Jake won't
	     give me nothing.
	
	JOEY walks over to the ring. The REPORTER follows not far
	behind.
	
	               JOEY
	     C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look
	     stupid. I brought these guys up
	     here, now you don't wanna talk to
	     them? What are ya doin'? Open your
	     mouth, for Christsake.
	
	JAKE nods his head, steps out of the ring, and goes directly
	over to the REPORTER, who is about to say: "Hi, Jake."
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     I'm tallin' you now, when I read
	     this, it better not make me look
	     bad.
	
	               REPORTER
	     Jake, did I ever make you look bad
	     before?
	
	               JAKE
	     Maybe it wasn't you, but you know
	     what I'm talkin' about.
	
	               JOEY
	          (interrupting)
	     Don't worry. Don't worry. It's
	     gonna be all right.
	          (to reporter)
	     Ask him your questions.
	
	               REPORTER
	     All right, Jake, you're being
	     talked about as the top
	     middleweight contender. Do you
	     think another victory over Sugar
	     Ray will get you a shot at the
	     title?
	
	               JAKE
	     Why not? There's nobody else around
	     who wants to fight me; they're all
	     afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't
	     have a shot at the title right now.
	
	               REPORTER
	     Well, the word is to get a title
	     shot you have to cooperate with the
	     people who control boxing, in New
	     York. And they're saying that you
	     don't cooperate.
	
	               JAKE
	     You guys know more about that than
	     I do. I just fight...
	
	               JOEY
	          (interrupting)
	     He fights the toughest guys around
	     that everybody else is afraid to
	     fight...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar
	     Ray, and I still don't have a shot
	     at the title.
	
	               REPORTER
	     You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks
	     ago and you're training like this
	     right now... Are you afraid Sugar
	     Ray might beat you this time?
	
	               JAKE
	     I tell you what. You hit me here.
	          (points to his right
	          cheek)
	     Sugar Ray hits me here.
	          (points to his left cheek)
	     I can't tell the difference. I just
	     fight.
	
	JAKE turns to VICKIE, smiles, and prepares for his next
	SPARRING PARTNER.
	
	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB. 1943)
	
	JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the
	bed examining his muscle tone.
	
	He studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his
	wrists. Clenches. Unclenches.
	
	VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and
	panties.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Are you sure we should be doing
	     this?
	
	               JAKE
	     Come over here.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You said never to touch you before
	     a fight.
	
	               JAKE
	          (lovingly)
	     If you let me do it, I'll murder
	     you. Come here.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You said I couldn't. You've been
	     good for two weeks...
	
	               JAKE
	     Come here.
	
	JAKE watches VICKIE approach him. He respects her as he would
	a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.
	
	His round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised
	knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.
	
	She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised
	face.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Take off my pants.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake...
	
	               JAKE
	     Do what I say.
	
	He touches her breasts as she removes his trousers.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Now take the rest off.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake, you made me promise not to
	     get you excited.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go 'head. Do it.
	
	She pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She
	kisses his chest and licks it.
	
	               VICKIE
	     I like the gym smell.
	
	               JAKE
	     Now take your panties off.
	
	She does.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Now, touch me...
	          (takes her hand)
	     ... here.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Oh, Jake.
	
	She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his
	erection.
	
	JAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on
	VICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold
	water.
	
	VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold
	water. She is shocked and surprised.
	
	               JAKE
	     I can't do it. I can't fool around.
	     This Robinson, I gotta beat him
	     again. I can't fool around. Don't
	     come near me.
	
	JAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly,
	he turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again,
	and he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes
	the door.
	
	INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 26, 1943)
	
	This is JAKE's rematch with SUGAR RAY (their 3rd fight). AN
	ANNOUNCER's VOICE gives a blow by blow description.
	
	THE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY
	knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and
	lefts. JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays
	in there.
	
	THE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY
	into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin.
	SUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however,
	the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY;
	instead, he comes back and outboxes JAKE.
	
	TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision: SUGAR RAY is
	the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for
	so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the
	fighters in the next bout.
	
	INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	JOEY and TONY are in the dressing room. JAKE sits on the
	table, dejected. His hand is being examined by a DOCTOR. TWO
	HANGERS-ON are also present.
	
	               JOEY
	          (angry)
	     They robbed us! Those fuckin'
	     judges -- What the fuck fight were
	     they watching? If I see them on the
	     street, I'll break their heads.
	     Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!
	     Those judges give him the decision
	     'cause he's goin in the army next
	     week! How else could this have
	     happened?... What do you think they
	     gave him the decision for, that's
	     why.
	
	               JAKE
	          (almost to himself)
	     Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked
	     him down. What did I do wrong? I
	     don't understand.
	
	               JOEY
	     You won and was robbed! You didn't
	     do nothin' wrong.
	
	               JAKE
	     I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to
	     win. I've done a lot of bad things.
	     I dunno...
	
	TONY goes to the door.
	
	               JOYE
	     Fuck that. This was the fight. This
	     coulda done it. This was our shot.
	     They out and out robbed us.
	
	MARIO comes back from the door.
	
	               MARIO
	     Vickie is here, Jake.
	
	               JAKE
	     I don't wanna see nobody.
	
	               JOEY
	     You want us to wait for you?
	
	               JAKE
	     No, take her home. I wanna be alone
	     for a while. Everybody go.
	
	They exit.
	
	                                   DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM
	
	JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the
	bathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly
	acquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.
	
	We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This
	song carries over onto the following MONTAGE.
	
	MONTAGE
	
	This MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947.
	It shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he
	can. Each of the fights will be introduced by the
	corresponding title card from the "Big Fights" film showing a
	boxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the
	fights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be
	black and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to
	simulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about
	to land a punch on an OPPONENT.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	Still #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's
	face, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects
	accompany these stills.
	
	The fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home
	movies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black
	and white).
	
	It'll go something like this:
	
	A) JAKE VS. FRITZIE ZIVIC at the Detroit Olympia (January 14,
	1944)
	
	B) JAKE, VICKIE, and JOEY, wearing sunglasses, pose in front
	of a Cadillac. (1944)
	
	C) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Madison Square Garden
	(February 23, 1945)
	
	D) JAKE and VICKIE getting married. (This will be a black and
	white still photo, posed especially for the occasion.) (1945,
	
	New Jersey courthouse)
	
	E) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Comiskey Park, Chicago
	(September 26, 1945)
	
	F) JAKE and VICKIE on vacation -- very loving. They are
	dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool. Then,
	JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside. She opens the
	box and takes out a white garment and turban. She kisses
	JAKE.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	VICKIE dressed in the outfit. She looks very much like Lana
	Turner in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." She kisses JAKE.
	(1946)
	
	G) JAKE VS. JIMMY EDGAR at Detroit (The University of Detroit
	Stadium) (June 12, 1946)
	
	H) JOEY's marriage. JAKE and VICKIE are there as witnesses.
	(Could also be a still photo as D was.) (1946)
	
	I) JAKE VS. BOB SATTERFIELD at Wrigley Field, Chicago
	(September 12, 1946)
	
	J) JAKE and VICKIE in front of their new Pelham Parkway
	house. It is an affluent, split-level house, an idyllic scene
	-- stone terrace, freshly cut lawn, etc. JAKE carries VICKIE
	inside.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	JAKE and VICKIE with their two boys JACK, age 2, and JOEY,
	age 1 in the backyard of the Pelham Parkway house; they are
	having a cookout. JOEY and his WIFE and their two children (a
	BOY and a GIRL about the same ages as JAKE's) are there also.
	(1947)
	
	K) JAKE VS. TOMMY BELL at Madison Square Garden (March 14,
	1947)
	
	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE (1947)
	
	WE SEE an early model, round screen television. Nearby an old
	radio. On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the
	preceding montage.
	
	JAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE
	JAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.
	
	JOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is
	near the television. There are some remnants of a snack on
	the table. JAKE's TWO BOYS are playing nearby.
	
	               JAKE
	          (to Joey as he turns down
	          the radio)
	     I just weighed myself - I'm 161. No
	     more deals like this Janiro
	     bullshit. I didn't tell you to do
	     it in the first place.
	
	               JOEY
	     Jake, you're the one who said you
	     could get down to 155! What did I
	     do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
	
	               JAKE
	          (angry)
	     Well, sometimes you shouldn't
	     listen to me! Now I don't know if I
	     can make it down to 155. I'm having
	     trouble making 160, and without
	     telling me, you sign me for a fight
	     at 155 pounds, and if I don't make
	     155, I forfeit $15,000! You're
	     supposed to know what you're doin'.
	     You're supposed to be a manager!
	
	               JOEY
	     You want the title shot?
	
	               JAKE
	     Say what you're gonna say.
	
	               JOEY
	     You want the title shot or not?
	
	               JAKE
	     Say what you gotta say. Don't be a
	     smart ass.
	
	               JOEY
	          (yelling)
	     This Janiro's an up-and-coming
	     fighter, this kid you gotta knock
	     out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm
	     telling you, this is your step
	     towards getting a shot at the
	     title. Listen to me: I'm telling
	     you. You been killin' yourself for
	     three years. There's nobody left --
	     they're afraid to fight you.
	     This Janiro's up-and-coming. He
	     don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,
	     wipe him out! What are you worried
	     about? Your weight? Look, even if
	     you lose they're gonna think you're
	     weak; they're gonna think you're
	     not the fighter you used to be.
	     They'll match you with guys they
	     were afraid to match you with
	     before, and then you'll kill them
	     and you'll get your title shot. And
	     if you beat this kid Janiro, they
	     gotta give you a shot at the title
	     because there's nobody else. Either
	     way you win and you do it on your
	     own -- just like you want it. All
	     right?
	
	               VICKIE
	     Joey's right. Janiro's up-and
	     coming, he's good looking...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     What do you mean, "good looking?"
	
	               VICKIE
	     Well, he's popular. A lotta people
	     like Janiro. You beat him and it
	     only figures they'll wanna see you
	     get a title shot. But, what do I
	     know? I should keep my mouth shut,
	     I should...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
	
	               VICKIE
	     But, Jake, I was just...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
	
	               VICKIE
	     I was just...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
	
	VICKIE, amazed, gets up to leave.
	
	JAKE glares at her.
	
	VICKIE rounds up the kids and takes them into the kitchen.
	(MOVING SHOT).
	
	WE SEE VICKIE in the kitchen angrily throwing things around.
	We clearly see the tension as she cleans up, muttering to
	herself.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	          (turns to Joey)
	     All right, manager. Everybody had
	     their say around here. Now this is
	     what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna get
	     down to 155, and I'm gonna destroy
	     this kid -- get my title shot. And
	     don't ever bet 15 thousand without
	     my sayso again.
	
	JAKE comes into the kitchen. He tries to make up with VICKIE.
	She plays hard-to-get. They begin to tease each other.
	
	INT. COPACABANA LOUNGE - NIGHT (1947)
	
	A COMEDIAN is in the middle of his act. JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY,
	and JANET sit at a nearby table. JANET, an attractive blonde,
	is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her,
	you know this is not his wife.
	
	The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his
	routine to point out that JAKE LAMOTTA is in the audience,
	and even tries a little harmless joking at JAKE's expense.
	
	               COMEDIAN
	     Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
	     point out a special guest we have
	     with us tonight -- The Raging Bull,
	     The Bronx Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.
	
	There is applause. JAKE smiles, and gives a hesitant wave.
	
	               COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
	     Stand up, Jake, c'mon. Oh, you are
	     standing. Sorry.
	          (laughs)
	     Just kiddin', Jake.
	
	JAKE waves a fist at the COMEDIAN, good-naturedly playing
	along with the joke -- even though he hates it.
	
	               JAKE
	          (to Joey)
	     Look at this abuse I gotta take.
	
	JOEY, VICKIE, and JANET are amused.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	          (joking)
	     What's so funny?
	          (lifting his glass)
	     Cheers! Post-time. Joey, Vickie,
	     and...
	          (to Janet)
	     What's your name again, darling?
	
	               JANET
	     Janet.
	
	JAKE Smiles. They all drink.
	
	SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed
	even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.),
	comes over to their table. He walks around like he owns the
	fucking place. JAKE hates it.
	
	               SALVY
	     Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'?
	     Vickie...
	
	They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.
	
	SALVY goes on his way to COMO's table.
	
	As SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE.
	
	               JAKE
	     What're you lookin' at? You lookin'
	     at him?
	
	               VICKIE
	     No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
	
	               JAKE
	     Don't tell me "No." I saw you
	     lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
	
	               VICKIE
	     I'm not interested in him.
	
	               JAKE
	     You're not interested in him?
	
	               VICKIE
	     No, I'm not.
	
	               JAKE
	     In other words, you're not
	     interested in him but you'd be
	     interested in somebody else, right?
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
	
	               JAKE
	          (turns to Joey, referring
	          to Salvy)
	     Look at this, all of a sudden
	     everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around
	     here. Did you see the way she was
	     lookin' at him?
	
	               JOEY
	     Nah, she would never...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Didn't you just see her lookin' at
	      him? She told me no, but I don't
	      believe her.
	
	                JOEY
	           (uncomfortable)
	      C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy
	      about you.
	
	JAKE gives him a suspicious look. JOEY feels uneasy.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'd just love to catch her. Oooooh,
	      I'd just love to catch her once.
	
	Drinks arrive at their table.
	
	                WAITER
	      These are from Tommy Como.
	
	JAKE looks up but can't see where COMO is. JOEY gets up.
	
	                JOEY
	           (to Jake)
	      Excuse me for a minute. Be right
	      back.
	
	                JAKE
	           (sarcastic)
	      Don't be long. I'm afraid with all
	      these tough guys here.
	
	JOEY goes to COMO's table in the rear of the lounge. JAKE
	slides over and watches. JOEY shakes hands with COMO. SALVY
	is there at COMO's table. JOEY comes right back.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jake, come over for a few minutes.
	      Tommy wants to say hello to you.
	      C'mon, just come and say hello.
	
	JAKE doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway.
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE: COMO's table. JAKE comes over.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hi, Tommy. How are you?
	
	                TOMMY
	      Jake, sit down for a minute.
	
	JAKE sits. SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE. JAKE barely nods
	back.
	
	                TOMMY (CONT'D)
	           (his arm around Jake)
	      Fuckin' kid! You're the best
	      fuckin' fighter around. Loved what
	      you did to Satterfield. Them
	      "moulan yans" -- forget about it.
	      They're all afraid to fight you.
	
	                JAKE
	           (a little embarrassed)
	      C'mon, Tommy --
	
	                TOMMY
	      How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin'
	      good?
	
	                JAKE
	      Never felt better.
	
	                TOMMY
	      Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
	
	                JAKE
	      He should.
	
	                TOMMY
	           (to Salvy)
	      This Janiro's a good fiahter,
	      pretty good-lookin' kid.
	
	                SALVY
	      Bet on him three times. Always come
	      through for me.
	
	JAKE just stares, holding his anger in.
	
	There is a pause.
	
	                TOMMY
	      How's the weight? Ok?
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah, the weight's Ok.
	
	Another pause. TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.
	
	                TOMMY
	      All right, lemme ask you something.
	      Let's say I was a good friend of
	      yours. And I was telling you I was
	      gonna bet a lot of money on you in
	      this Janiro fight. What would you
	      tell me?
	
	                JAKE
	      I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
	
	TOMMY sips his drink.
	
	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	VICKIE is in bed trying to sleep. JAKE comes out of the
	bathroom half-dressed, and sits on the edge of the bed
	(preoccupied). Silence.
	
	                JAKE
	      Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
	
	                VICKIE
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      You asleep?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Yeah.
	
	                JAKE
	      Huh?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Yeah, what?
	
	                JAKE
	      Tell me, you think of anybody else
	      when I'm making love to you?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Nobody. I love you, remember?
	
	                JAKE
	      Then why'd you say that thing about
	      Tony Janiro?
	
	                VICKIE
	      What did I say?
	
	                JAKE
	      That he's got a pretty face.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I never noticed his face.
	
	                JAKE
	      You sure you're not thinking of him
	      right now?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Positive.
	
	                JAKE
	      You're the one who said he was good
	      looking. You think he's good
	      looking 'cause I know you think
	      he's good-looking. I'll smash his
	      face inside out. I'll make him into
	      dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's
	      good-looking when I get through
	      with him. So you just go ahead and
	      think about who you want.
	
	VICKIE freezes.
	
	INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY
	
	TONY JANIRO, wearing boxer trunks, steps off the scale.
	Commissioner COL. EDDIE EAGAN, a white-haired, heavyset man
	in his mid-forties, calls out the weight.
	
	The basement of the New York Boxing Commission on Worth
	Street is a sparse room, crowded with REPORTERS, TRAINERS and
	MANAGERS.
	
	                EAGAN
	      Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half.
	
	JAKE steps on the scale. He looks weak and woozy. After the
	customary adjustments, EAGAN calls out:
	
	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
	      Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one
	      fourth.
	
	There's a commotion in JAKE's camp. JANIRO smiles.
	
	                JAKE
	      Just a minute.
	
	JAKE, JOEY, and TONY confer.
	
	JAKE gets off the scale and enters the men's room. An
	OFFICIAL follows him.
	
	INT. THE MEN'S ROOM
	
	JAKE forces himself to urinate.
	
	INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT
	
	JAKE comes out of the bathroom, and gets back on the scale.
	
	                EAGAN
	      Ok. This is official.
	
	LAMOTTA stares at JANIRO.
	
	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
	      LaMotta, 155 lbs. on the nose.
	
	JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss.
	
	INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
	
	It's the last round and JAKE is pouring it on a beaten and
	virtually helpless JANIRO.
	
	The CROWD chants:
	
	                CROWD
	      LaMotta.
	
	HALF THE AUDIENCE is already on its feet. The kill is
	imminent -- and they love it.
	
	JAKE lands one blow after another. He is relentless.
	
	Several rows back, TOMMY COMO, SALVY and SEVERAL OTHER "MADE"
	GUYS sit with sober looks on their faces.
	
	JAKE moves in fast, and with a powerful barrage, smashes
	JANIRO's nose -- plastering it against his left cheek.
	
	The final bell rings. JANIRO, his legs all rubber, staggers
	back to his corner.
	
	JAKE prances about, kissing his fists and throwing them to
	the CROWD. JOEY rushes out, throws JAKE's leopard skin robe
	over him and embraces him. TONY follows. JAKE looks right at
	COMO and SALVY.
	
	AN ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring:
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      The winner, by unanimous decision,
	      in ten rounds, Jake LaMotta!
	
	                JOEY
	      I love you.
	
	JAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight,
	still manages to prance around the ring victoriously.
	
	VICKIE, now near the ring, throws kisses to JAKE.
	
	                JAKE
	           (shouts to Vickie)
	      This is my night! Listen to them!
	      I'm gonna be champ!
	
	He bends down and gives her a kiss through the ropes.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      I'm making everything up to you.
	
	INT. COPACABANA - NIGHT (1947)
	
	JOEY is at the bar with a DETROIT PROMOTER and JACKIE CURTIE.
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      When we gonna get Jake back in
	      Detroit? Jesus, he really did a job
	      on Janiro. Who you after next,
	      Joey?
	
	                JOEY
	           (evasive)
	      I dunno. We're working on it. He's
	      training at the camp now.
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      After what I seen, they gotta give
	      him a shot at the title.
	
	                JOEY
	      We're gonna get our shot.
	
	The DETROIT PROMOTER introduces JOEY to JACKIE CURTIE.
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Oh Joey, this is Jackie Curtie. He
	      handles a lot of business in South
	      Ohio.
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      I like your brother. Made a lot of
	      money on him.
	
	                JOEY
	      Betcha more than he has.
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      Made a little cabbage on the Tommy
	      Bell fight too. Whatever happened
	      to him?
	
	                JOEY
	      Ain't he dead?
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Nah. He's got a job downtown. Runs
	      an elevator in some building.
	
	                JOEY
	      Yeah?
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Went down to see him the other day.
	      I says, "Tommy, take me up to the
	      fifth floor." And you know, he took
	      me right up there. 
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      Yeah, Tommy always was a stand-up
	      guy.
	
	SALVY and PATSY arrive with VERA, SANDY (two neighborhood
	girls), and VICKIE. They go to a nearby table.
	
	The bar area: JOEY sees this.
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Joey, let me get you another drink.
	
	                JOEY
	           (distracted)
	      Just a minute. Excuse me. I'll be
	      right back.
	
	The table area: JOEY arrives at SALVY's table. VICKIE is
	nervous. There is a cold exchange of'"hellos."
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	           (to Vickie)
	      C'mere, let me talk to you for a
	      minute.
	
	There is an awkward silence as he grabs VICKIE by the arm and
	takes her over to the hat-check area.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      What're you doin' with Salvy? You
	      shouldn't be here with him. Jake's
	      away killin' himself. Suppose he
	      found out.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What the hell am I doing wrong?
	      Just because Jake is training, I
	      can't go out? What am I, a goddamn
	      prisoner?
	
	                JOEY
	      No, you're his wife.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I'm not doing anythina wrong. I'm
	      just trying to have a good time. Do
	      I have to be cooped up in the house
	      all the time?
	
	                JOEY
	      It don't look right.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's
	      gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter
	      of time.
	
	                JOEY
	      I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but
	      if he finds out, he will kill you.
	      What's the matter with you? Aren't
	      you happy? You got everything you
	      want.
	
	                VICKIE
	      You don't sleep with him. I do. I
	      don't get to breathe without
	      tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage.
	      If he thinks I'm lookin' at
	      somebody the wrong way, I get used
	      as a punching bag. He don't trust
	      nobody. If he saw the two of us
	      talking together right now, you'd
	      be in trouble too -- believe me.
	      Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old.
	      I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake,
	      but you don't know. He gets crazy
	      sometimes. I'm scared.
	
	                JOEY
	      Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's
	      got a lotta aggravation. He's been
	      a top contender too long.
	
	                VICKIE
	      That's right, take his part. You're
	      his brother. He's never gonna be
	      champ. Too many people are against
	      him.
	
	                JOEY
	      And you're drinking with them right
	      now.
	
	                VICKIE
	      And I'm gonna finish my drink. And,
	      I'm gonna have a good time, because
	      I ain't doing nothing wrong.
	
	She starts to go back to the table.
	
	                JOEY
	           (grabbing her)
	      You're wrong to be here. Let's go.
	
	VICKIE pulls away from JOEY, and goes back to the table.
	
	The table area: JOEY arrives at the table. He grabs VICKIE.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      I said, let's go.
	
	                SALVY
	      Joey, relax. You're taking this the
	      wrong way. Why don't you sit down
	      and have a drink?
	
	                JOEY
	      Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister
	      in-law.
	
	                SALVY
	      Excuse me for living.
	
	                JOEY
	      What do you think, I'm blind? My
	      brother's breaking his ass in a
	      ring, and you're here with his
	      wife.
	
	                SALVY
	      Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and
	      Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just
	      happened to come along. We're just
	      trying to have a good time. What do
	      you want from me? So, why don't you
	      just take it easy before this gets
	      out of hand.
	
	As the conversation gets louder, PEOPLE begin to notice.
	PAUL, the owner (a tough-looking, well-dressed guy), and some
	BOUNCERS also become aware of the argument.
	
	                JOEY
	      Get the fuck outa here. What did
	      you do, take your gangster pills
	      today? I'll tear your fuckin' head
	      off your shoulders!
	
	JOEY goes for SALVY. PEOPLE react.
	
	The GIRLS begin to scream. VICKIE exits. JOEY notices her
	leave, and calls after her.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Hey, wait --
	
	PAUL comes over and stops the fight.
	
	                PAUL
	      Ain't you forgettin' something?
	      Ain't there never supposed to be no
	      trouble in this joint?
	
	SALVY and JOEY give each other looks. JOEY goes out after
	VICKIE.
	
	EXT. COPACABANA - NIGHT
	
	JOEY looks up the street for VICKIE. She is gone.
	
	SALVY and PATSY come out of the entrance.
	
	                SALVY
	      Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die
	      young?
	
	                JOEY
	           (as he turns and lashes
	           into Salvy and Patsy)
	      I'll suck your eyes out! I'll
	      fuckin' take the two of you.
	
	After a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come
	out. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY
	and JOEY, but can't.
	
	JOEY savagely beats SALVY on the Copa steps and in the street
	against the parked cars.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Fuckin' low-life, cocksucker, etc.
	      ...
	
	SALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him.
	SALVY hits the pavement. JOEY kicks him.
	
	PAUL, PATSY, and the BOUNCERS finally pull JOEY away. PATSY
	tries to go after JOEY again, but PAUL stops him.
	
	                PATSY
	           (to Paul)
	      Don't fuckin' put your hands on me!
	      You're gonna near about this, Paul.
	
	                PAUL
	           (to Patsy)
	      Get the fuck outa here. Don't come
	      in my place and start fuckin'
	      trouble -- I don't care who you
	      are!
	           (to Joey)
	      Get outa here. Go on.
	
	JOEY looks back at him, and then walks away.
	
	INT. THE BACK ROOM OF THE DEBONAIR SOCIAL CLUB
	
	The room is furnished with a few round tables and some
	chairs; it is somewhat reminiscent of an old-fashioned candy
	store.
	
	TOMMY COMO, SALVY, PATSY and JOEY are present. SALVY's face
	is bruised from the beating JOEY gave him.
	
	                COMO
	      All rightg I don't have to hear any
	      more. I think I understand what
	      happened. I understand it was your
	      brother's wife and there was
	      probably a misunderstanding. I'm
	      not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have
	      acted the way he did. But, Joey,
	      you don't raise your hands. You
	      don't do that kind of thing. This
	      time we forget about it but no more
	      after this. You understand?
	
	                JOEY
	      Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
	
	                COMO
	      All right, you guys, shake hands.
	
	SALVY, JOEY, and PATSY shake hands.
	
	                COMO (CONT'D)
	      Go 'head. Be friends. That's it.
	           (to Salvy and Patsy)
	      All right, lemme be alone with him
	      for a minute.
	
	SALVY and PATSY exit.
	
	There is a pause.
	
	                COMO (CONT'D)
	      Aside from everything else, your
	      family all right?
	
	                JOEY
	      Yeah, they're good. They're good,
	      Tommy.
	
	                COMO
	      What is it with you? Can't you
	      talk? You got like a funny
	      attitude. I can't figure you out,
	      Joey. What's with you and the quick
	      answers? You wanna get outa here
	      fast?
	
	                JOEY
	      Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
	
	                COMO
	      Look Joey, I wanna tell you
	      something.
	      Your brother ain't gonna get
	      nowhere without us -- nowhere. And
	      I'm tellin' you between the two of
	      us, it's gettin' to the point where
	      it's gettin' to be a real
	      embarrassment to me, a real
	      embarrassment.
	
	                JOEY
	      How can he embarrass you?
	
	                COMO
	      He's an embarrassment because
	      Frankie and the other guys are
	      expectin' me to do something about
	      it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I
	      can't deliver a kid from my own
	      neighborhood. Why's he make it so
	      hard on himself? He comes to me, I
	      can make it easier for him.
	
	                JOEY
	      Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't
	      even say hello to anybody else --
	      you know that. But you know when
	      Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus
	      Christ Almighty could get off the
	      fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna
	      talk him out of it. I'm his kid
	      brother. I got no say with Jake on
	      this. He thinks he can buck
	      everybody and make it on his own.
	
	                COMO
	      Make it on his own? Does he know
	      the kind of money involved? I mean
	      the real money. He thinks he's
	      gonna become champ on his own?
	      We're gonna sit by and see some nut
	      come in there and hold one of the
	      most important titles in the world?
	      A nut who don't listen to nobody or
	      respect nobody? Is he really crazy?
	      Listen, Joey, you understand, you
	      tell him. I don't care how great he
	      is or how colorful. He could beat
	      all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all
	      the Janiros he wants to. He ain't
	      gonna get a shot at the title
	      without us. I'm not askin' you to
	      do another thing except get that
	      message into that thick head!
	
	EXT. SHORERAVEN POOL - DAY
	
	Another day. JOEY, fully clothed, opens the gate and looks
	around.
	
	JAKE is sitting alone near the deep end. JOEY walks over to
	him.
	
	                JOEY
	      Whatcha doin'?
	
	                JAKE
	      I remember the first time I met
	      Vickie... I know there's somethin'
	      up. I know she's doin' somethin',
	      but I can't catch her...
	
	                JOEY
	      Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit
	      her so she can't talk to you the
	      way she wants to.
	
	                JAKE
	      What do you mean?
	
	                JOEY
	      Try talkin' to her. She's your wife
	      -- ask her what's the matter.
	
	                JAKE
	      When I'm away, did you ever notice
	      anythin' funny with her? Tell me
	      the truth.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jack, if there was anything funny,
	      I would tell you.
	
	                JAKE
	      I want you to keep an eye on her
	      when I'm not here. Understand?
	
	                JOEY
	      Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
	
	                JAKE
	      What did Tommy say?
	
	                JOEY
	      I got good news, and I got bad
	      news. The good news is you got your
	      shot at the title. The bad news
	      is...
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting, resigned)
	      Yeah, I know.
	
	INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY
	
	As BILLY FOX steps off the scales, EDDIE EAGAN calls out:
	
	                EAGAN
	      Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds.
	
	JOEY removes JAKE's leopard-skin robe as he steps on the
	scale. The REPORTERS crowd around.
	
	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
	      Jake LaMotta, 167 pounds.
	
	JAKE'S HANDLERS urge him with words of encouragement as they
	walk toward his dressing room.
	
	INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
	
	EAGAN walks over.
	
	                JAKE
	      What's up, Colonel?
	
	                EAGAN
	      I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
	
	                JOEY
	      Sure.
	
	                EAGAN
	      I suppose you heard what
	      everybody's been saying, Jake.
	
	                JAKE
	      What who's been sayin'?
	
	                EAGAN
	      You were a big favorite in this
	      fight. Then two days ago the odds
	      start jumping all over the place
	      until you're a 12-5 underdog.
	
	                JAKE
	      I don't follow no gamblin'
	      Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
	
	                EAGAN
	      Now the fight's off the books
	      altogether.
	      Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet
	      down on this fight. Some people are
	      saying you're going into the tank.
	
	                JAKE
	      Believe what you want.
	
	                EAGAN
	      I want to believe you, LaMotta.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin'
	      jig's gonna wish he never came outa
	      the jungle. You got any money?
	
	                EACAN
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      You got any money you want to bet
	      on Billy Fox, you can put it right
	      here...
	           (extends his hand)
	      'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down
	      for nobody.
	
	EAGAN taps JAKE on the shoulder.
	
	                EAGAN
	      That's all I wanted to hear.
	
	JAKE glares at EAGAN as the COMMISSIONER walks away.
	
	INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT (NOV. 14, 1947)
	
	The old Garden is packed. The EX-CHAMPS, the PRESS, the
	OFFICIALS, the MOB GUYS, the FANS -- they're all here.
	
	The FIGHTERS are announced. BILLY FOX and JAKE touch gloves
	and return to their corners.
	
	FOX is taller and has a longer reach than JAKE.
	
	The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS come out. FOX goes to the
	head; JAKE goes to the body.
	
	FOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.
	FOX is surprised. In the past, his opponents have gone down
	when he connected.
	
	In the audience, COMO, SALVY, and some other BOYS watch with
	interest.
	
	JAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows.
	All of a sudden, FOX is wobbly. JAKE goes for the head, then
	cuts his punch short. FOX is about to go down.
	
	JAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesn't fall.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Fox)
	      Stand up! What the fuck are you
	      doin'?
	
	The REFEREE breaks them apart and FOX remounts his attack.
	JAKE bicycles into a corner and lets FOX work him over.
	
	FOX connects: once, twice, three times. JAKE barely defends
	himself -- but he doesn't go down either.
	
	The CROWD starts to smell a fix. There are calls from the
	AUDIENCE.
	
	                CROWD
	      Got your swimming trunks on, Jake?
	      I hope they're paying you enough.
	      Fake, fake.
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	JAKE's corner. JAKE is acting stunned. TONY, not aware of
	what's going on, is slapping JAKE.
	
	                TONY
	      What's the matter with you? What's
	      the matter with you?
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	The sign reads "Round Four." JAKE is in the center of the
	ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX. JAKE's arms hang
	at waist level... FOX lands one blow after another. The stink
	of a fix permeates the arena.
	
	JAKE is furious that FOX can't deck him. He curses through
	his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):
	
	                JAKE
	      Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter
	      with you, you motherfucker? Hit me!
	
	Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden. This is not even a
	fight. The REFEREE, realizing this, steps in between FOX and
	LAMOTTA, waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by
	a technical knockout.
	
	As he does, JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and
	struts back to his corner.
	
	JAKE, JOEY, and TONY are already on their way out of the
	arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner.
	
	COMO and the OTHERS, satisfied, get up to leave.
	
	INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
	
	As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door, WE
	SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. They rush
	in, look, and stop by the door. There is silence -- except
	for JAKE'S uncontrollable sobbing. The atmosphere is like
	that of funeral.
	
	JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table. He is still in his
	leopard-skin robe. His head hangs low as he sobs.
	
	The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. The HANDLER motions to him
	to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. The REPORTER
	still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the
	scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to
	scribble away on his pad.
	
	JOEY, standing near JAKE, has his back to everyone; his
	shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. He cries
	soundlessly. TONY is pacing nearby.
	
	                TONY
	      Don't fight anymore!
	           (pause)
	      It's a free country, don't fight
	      anymore!
	
	                JAKE
	           (between sobs)
	      Why did they have to stop it? Why
	      did they have to stop it?
	
	The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers.
	
	                REPORTER
	      What happened?
	
	                HANDLER
	           (quietly)
	      He must've been really hurt in the
	      2nd. He didn't answer me when I
	      tried to tell him something in the
	      corner.
	
	JAKE, still buried in his robe, becomes aware of the hum of
	voices and shouts out:
	
	                JAKE
	      Get everyone out of here!
	
	The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave. JAKE continues to
	sob.
	
	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	INSERT: CLOSE UP of a Daily News Headline from November 22,
	1947: "Board Suspends LaMotta."
	
	JAKE, dejected, sits on the couch. In front of him, on the
	coffee table are scattered several newspapers -- including
	the one with the headline we have just seen.
	
	JOEY paces in front of JAKE.
	
	                JOEY
	           (yelling)
	      It woulda been so easy, Jack. So
	      easy...
	
	JOEY goes into a boxing stance.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Stick out your hands, Jake.
	
	                JAKE
	      C'mon, Joey.
	
	                JOEY
	      G'wan, do it.
	           (jabs at him)
	      Protect yourself, rummy.
	
	JAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY
	feigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- "out cold." JAKE
	looks down at him.
	
	JOEY pops to his feet.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      See? That's all there was to it.
	
	                JAKE
	      What the fuck they want? I took the
	      dive. They want me to fall down
	      too? I don't fall down for nobody.
	      I never went down in my life. Joey,
	      what do I gotta do?
	      Crawl on my hands and knees? I made
	      an asshole of myself in the fuckin'
	      Garden! All the newspaper writers
	      make fun of me. I'm the bum of the
	      year. All I want is a shot. Just a
	      fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do?
	      I'll do anything.
	
	                JOEY
	      Except fall down like a normal
	      person.
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah, except fall down. That's
	      right.
	
	                JOEY
	      All right, you don't wanna fall
	      down, so now you gotta take a rest.
	      So, you enjoy the suspension.
	      'Cause there's nothin' you can do
	      about it. Let the Commissioner and
	      the D.A. jerk you around. So you
	      wait.
	
	                JAKE
	      Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am
	      I gonna do for seven months? I'm
	      gonna go crazy. How do I keep my
	      strength? By that time I'll be too
	      weak to win the title. And my
	      weight? Forget about it -- I'm
	      gonna blow up like a balloon. I
	      ain't never gonna hold my weight
	      down. Seven months! I don't know...
	
	                JOEY
	      We did what we had to do. Tommy
	      don't forget. Sooner or later
	      you'll get your shot -- if Tommy
	      don't die.

	JAKE's suite is modestly decorated and consists of a living
	room and two bedrooms.
	
	DR. PINTO is there sewing up a pork chop.
	
	JAKE, shadow-boxing in sportswear, paces back and forth.
	
	TONY watches him. VICKIE sits quietly on the sofa, sipping
	some wine.
	
	JOEY is on the phone.
	
	                JOEY
	      That's right. "No comment."
	           (listens)
	      You like that? Good, 'cause I got a
	      lot more "No comments" where that
	      one came from.
	
	JOEY cuts the line off, then leaves the receiver off the
	hook.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have
	      a steak.
	
	                JAKE
	      I can't eat a steak. If I eat a
	      steak, I'm gonna have trouble
	      making the weigh-in.
	
	                JOEY
	      So eat just a little. You gotta eat
	      something.
	
	                JARS
	      What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I
	      can't even eat!
	
	JAKE goes into the bedroom.
	
	JOEY goes over to the DOCTOR.
	
	                DOCTOR
	           (shows him the pork chop)
	      How's that?
	
	                JOEY
	      How long did it take you?
	
	                DOCTOR
	      45 seconds.
	
	                JOEY
	      No good. Try to get it down. It's
	      gotta be no more than 30 seconds to
	      be on the safe side if we gotta
	      stitch him up.
	
	INT. THE BEDROOM
	
	JAKE is alone. There is a knock at the door. JOEY opens it
	and pokes his head in.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jake, somebody wants to say hello
	      to you.
	
	JOEY opens the door wider. TOMMY COMO is at the door with
	JOEY. JAKE goes over to the door.
	
	                COMO
	      Hey champ!
	
	                JAKE
	      Tommy, thanks for coming over.
	
	                COMO
	      You just take it easy, now. You'll
	      do all right. Feelin' Ok?
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm Ok.
	
	                COMO
	      Just come by to wish you luck.
	           (shakes his hand)
	      Need anything?
	
	                JAKE
	      No, we're all right. Thanks anyway,
	      Tommy.
	
	                COMO
	      Ok, champ.
	
	COMO turns to go. He says goodbye to everyone in the living
	room. He goes over and kisses VICKIE. JAKE watches this from
	the bedroom doorway.
	
	                COMO (CONT'D)
	           (as he kisses Vickie)
	      Look at her. As beautiful as
	      always. Take care of that guy, will
	      ya?
	
	                VICKIE
	           (going to the door with
	           him)
	      I'll take care of him. Thanks,
	      Tommy. Bye.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Vickie)
	      C'mere.
	
	She goes to the bedroom doorway. JAKE grabs her arm, pulls
	her in, and slams the door.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	           (pushing her toward the
	           bed area)
	      Hey, you don't say goodbye to him
	      like that.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What did I do?
	
	                JAKE
	           (pushing her)
	      You don't kiss like that. Hello and
	      goodbye, that's all you do.
	
	                VICKIE
	      All I did...
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      You know what I'm talking about.
	      Don't ever make me look bad on the
	      night of my big fight.
	
	                VICKIE
	      You're hurting my arm.
	
	JAKE has her by the night table now. They are edging their
	way to the wall.
	
	                JAKE
	      Shut up. You just say hello and
	      goodbye to him. You don't kiss him
	      the way you did. That's out of
	      line.
	
	JAKE pushes her against the wall. The lamp falls. There is a
	loud crash. She tries to move away. He grabs her by the
	throat and pins her against the wall. She's gagging.
	
	                VICKIE
	      But Jake... I didn't say
	      anything...
	
	                JAKE
	      Don't ever do that again. You don't
	           (he pushes her against the
	           wall)
	      do it!
	
	                VICKIE
	           (gagging)
	      Jake...
	
	JOEY looks in and then starts to come over.
	
	                JAKE
	      You hear what I said? You don't do
	      it.
	
	He pushes her again. VICKIE tries to get away, but can't
	move.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	           (pushing her again)
	      You don't do it.
	
	JOEY has his hand on JAKE's arm, trying to pry it away from
	VICKIE's throat.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jake, Jake...
	
	TONY and the DOCTOR watch from the doorway.
	
	VICKIE's eyes close. JAKE releases his grip. JOEY helps
	VICKIE. JAKE watches this.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to himself)
	      She ain't gonna ruin this fight for
	      me.
	
	EXT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT (JUNE 16, 1949)
	
	Bright floodlights illuminate the arena. The weather's clear
	and the stadium is filled with cheering fight FANS.
	
	An ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring and begins ti
	introduce the many CELEBRITIES that have gathered for the
	fight.
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      And here is the young man who has
	      inherited Marcel Cerdan's European
	      championship - Laurent Dauthuille.
	
	DAUTHUILLE jumps into the ring.
	
	While WE HEAR him introduce the boxers and celebrities, WE
	SEE a rapid MONTAGE: JAKE preparing for the title bout:
	
	PRE-FIGHT MONTAGE
	
	A) JAKE and GROUP arrive in the dressing room.
	
	B) In his bathrobe, JAKE puts on his boxing shoes.
	
	C) We see a pan with raw steak in it. JOEY drains the blood
	(juice) into a glass and JAKE takes a long, slow swallow.
	
	D) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION) - NEW
	ANGLE.
	
	TOMMY COMO shakes JAKE's hand in the bathroom doorway. VICKIE
	kisses COMO. Jake watches.
	
	                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	      And our very special guest tonight
	      needs no introduction. The only man
	      to defend the heavyweight crown a
	      remarkable twenty-five times, the
	      king of all heavyweights, the Brown
	      Bomber, Joe Louis. Come into the
	      ring, Joe.
	
	                JOE LOUIS (V.O.)
	      Thank you, Johnny. Let's bring the
	      middleweight crown back to the old
	      U.S.A. where it belongs.
	
	Many cheers.
	
	E) DR. PINTO injects a hypodermic needle filled with
	novocaine into each of JAKE's fists.
	
	F) JOEY massages JAKE's neck.
	
	G) JAKE's hands are bandaged
	
	H) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION - NEW
	ANGLE)
	
	JAKE strangles VICKIE in the bedroom, then releases her.
	
	JOEY looks after her, but the IMAGE makes them look as if
	they're making love. Jake watches.
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      And in this corner, the
	      middleweight champion of the world,
	      from Casablanca, Morocco, the
	      Casablanca Clouter, Marcel Cerdan!
	
	I) JAKE puts on his cup and trunks.
	
	J) MARIO laces up JAKE's gloves.
	
	K) JAKE, ready to fight, a towel draped around his head,
	bounces on the balls of his feet. He starts walking down the
	corridor from his dressing room, surrounded by MARIO, JOEY,
	DR. PINTO and his HANDLERS. He enters the stadium.
	
	INT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	JAKE, wearing his leopard-skin robe, is pushed through the
	CROWD by JOEY, MARIO and his HANDLERS. He's still shadow
	boxing.
	
	JAKE steps into the ring to both cheers and boos (many still
	remember the Fox fight). JAKE raises his gloves.
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      And in the opposite corner, from
	      New York, New York, the challenger,
	      the Bronx Bull, Jake LaMotta!
	
	JAKE shakes hands with the assembled CELEBRITIES and EX
	CHAMPIONS.
	
	                JAYE
	      I only wish it was you, Joe.
	
	                JOE LOUIS
	      Win the belt back for us, Jake.
	      Good luck.
	
	JAKE glances at VICKIE who is sitting in the third row. She
	is nervous.
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	The opening bell sounds. CERDAN and LAMOTTA touch gloves and
	begin to fight.
	
	JAKE is hot: there's no stopping him tonight. He fights like
	a man possessed.
	
	CERDAN clinches JAKE to avoid his brutal body blows. JAKE
	pushes him out of the clinch in disgust.
	
	There are no more boos. JAKE has won over the crowd.
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	END OF ROUND NINE. JAKE is working over a bloody CERDAN.
	Punches to the body, then to the head, then back to the body.
	The bell sounds.
	
	JAKE walks back to his corner and sits down. JOEY is
	ecstatic:
	
	                JOEY
	      Look at him, Jackie! You got at!
	      The fuckin' championship! He's
	      yours! Finish him off.
	
	JAKE doesn't have the chance. The REFEREE, standing in
	CERDAN's corner, waves his hands signaling the end of the
	fight.
	
	The REFEREE holds up JAKE's hands as THE ANNOUNCER takes the
	mike:
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      The new middleweight champion of
	      the world by a knockout after nine
	      rounds, the Bronx Bull, Jake
	      LaMotta!
	
	JOEY is all over him. TONY helps VICKIE through the MOB.
	
	In his corner, CERDAN holds his head in his hands and says,
	"My title, my title!"
	
	The OFFICIALS clear a circle as they bring over the jewel
	studded championship belt. JOE LOUIS fastens the belt around
	JAKE's waist.
	
	JAKE touches the oversized belt with his bloody gloves. Tears
	fall across JAKE's huge grin as he holds his hands high in
	the air. It is the most glorious night in his life.
	
	EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)
	
	The name "Jake LaMotta's Lounge" is emblazoned in neon across
	a lounge/liquor store on Collins Avenue, Miami's main drag.
	JAKE's bar is across from The Rooney Plaza, one of Miami's
	more prestigious hotels.
	
	Fifties cars are parked outside the club.
	
	INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT
	
	JAKE LAMOTTA, 34 years old, wearing a tux, steps in front of
	a large painted wall mural of the Cerdan fight as he enters
	his club.
	
	The Lounge is dominated by a large circular bar. Featured
	entertainers perform on a raised platform in the center of
	the bar.
	
	The club is half filled with SPORTS, ENTERTAINMENT and MOB
	TYPES.
	
	The small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the
	platform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the
	BAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:
	
	                JAKE
	      Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	      It's a thrill to be standin' here
	      talking to you wonderful people. In
	      fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.
	      I haven't seen so many people since
	      my last fight at Madison Square
	      Garden. After that fight a reporter
	      asked me, "Jake, where do you go
	      from here?" I said, "To a
	      hospital."
	
	About HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are
	laughing, SOME a little too loud.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      I fought one hundred and six
	      professional fights and none of
	      them bums figured out how to fight
	      me -- they kept hitting me in the
	      head!
	           (calls to the bar)
	      Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? 
	      - get me a drink. I figure if I'm
	      gonna work to drunks I might as
	      well be one of 'em! I like this
	      place. It's a family type club...
	      every night I see a lot of fathers
	      sitting out there with their young
	      daughters! That's nice.
	
	LINDA hands him a drink.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.
	      The kinda girl you wanta take home
	      to meet your father. Especially if
	      your old man's a degenerate! --
	      Here's a toast! "To your health!
	      You only live once. But if you play
	      it right, once is enough." I
	      shouldn't be drinkin' like this
	      'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.
	      I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm
	      allowed to eat anything I want. As
	      long as I don't swallow it! Well, I
	      never had much luck with my weight.
	      In fact, -- I never had much luck
	      with anything -- until about a few
	      years ago, when this happened --
	
	He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,
	of which there is some.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      ... thanks, I'm glad to see you
	      remember. For those of you that
	      don't... that's me takin' the title
	      from Cerdan.
	      You know, the tough thing about
	      winnin' the title... the next thing
	      you gotta do is have a rematch...
	      just to show it wasn't no fluke. So
	      what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a
	      really great champ, after I beat
	      him... he gets himself killed in
	      that airplane crash... a pretty
	      rotten break for him. That's why I
	      don't like to fly. People say to
	      me, "Look, Jake, when your time is
	      up, your time is up." And I say,
	      "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane
	      and the pilot's time is up?" As
	      good as Cerdan was, I could've
	      taken him again. But I never got
	      the chance to prove it wasn't no
	      fluke. He got killed but he got to
	      be what they call a legend. I don't
	      know what's worse -- bein' a fluke
	      or bein' a legend. -- That's the
	      kinda luck I got. That's why I quit
	      the ring and moved down here from
	      New York. My wife said, "You gotta
	      get outa this town, Jake." Come to
	      think of it... the boxing
	      commission said the same thing! But
	      I don't miss New York. Give me
	      Miami any day.
	
	The AUDIENCE applauds.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Miami's a great place. I get along
	      with everybody in this town... even
	      the police force... They got the
	      best cops here money can buy! --
	      Only kiddin'. By the way... me and
	      my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to
	      celibrate our eleventh wedding
	      anniversary.
	
	More applause.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      We get along real great. We fight a
	      little but I never really belted
	      her on purpose. Once  in a while
	      I'm standin' there doin' little
	      shadow-boxin' and she happens to
	      walk right into the shadow... I
	      can't help that.
	      She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"
	      I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a
	      love tap." She says, "It's a good
	      thing you're not crazy about me!" --
	      I am crazy about her. I heard her
	      talkin' to a friend on the phone
	      and she was sayin', "After eleven
	      years, I'm still in love with the
	      same guy." -- If I ever find out
	      who the bum is, I'll kill him!
	      Women. You can't live with 'em, you
	      can't live without 'em.
	
	Then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's
	speech in Othello.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.
	      It is the green-eyed monster, which
	      doth mock the meat it feeds on.
	      That cuckold lives in bliss who,
	      certain of his fate, loves not his
	      woronger; But O, what damned
	      minutes tells he o'er who dotes,
	      yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly
	      loves!" -- That's from somethin'
	      called "Othello" --
	
	OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
	      cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
	      Kissing with inside lip? Stopping
	      the career of laughter with a sign?
	      -- A note infallible of breaking
	      honesty -- horsing foot on foot?
	      Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks
	      more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
	      midnight? and all eyes blind with
	      the pin and web but theirs, theirs
	      only, that would unseen be wicked?
	      Is this nothing? Why, then the
	      world and all that's in't is
	      nothing; The covering sky is
	      nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
	      is nothing; nor nothing have these
	      nothings, if this be nothing." --
	      That's from something called "The
	      Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
	      all remember Shakespeare.
	      He wrote all them famous plays one
	      after the other, then he went into
	      a big slump and he ain't done
	      anything good in years. That speech
	      is about jealousy -- jealousy's a
	      bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot
	      of guys... take me... I almost
	      killed my brother... I love him...
	      he's my family... I mean, there's
	      nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And
	      that's the way we been goin' thru
	      life -- doin' nothin' for each
	      other! Anytime he got in trouble
	      when we was kids, I got him out of
	      it. You know, he used to steal
	      little things when we was growin'
	      up. But he was particular... only
	      stole things that begin with an 'a'
	      -- a watch, a car, a suit, a
	      ring... But I was wrong... I
	      shoulda never hit my brother.
	      Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every
	      time I need somethin' I gotta go
	      shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
	      once told me, "When you hit your
	      brother you're really hittin' your
	      mother, but you can't admit it to
	      yourself." He's really crazy. I
	      woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
	      only in self-defense!
	
	INT. JAKE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY (1950)
	
	JAKE is struggling with his later model ten-inch RCA TV. He
	fools with the dials, then slaps the side. The bluish video
	image comes and goes. JOEY watches JAKE fix the TV.
	
	JAKE has a half-eaten sandwich in his hand.
	
	VICKIE enters the house, surprised to find JAKE home.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake, you're home.
	
	JAKE looks up at her. (She goes over to him and kisses him.)
	MOVING SHOT.
	
	JOEY gives VICKIE a polite peck on the mouth. MOVING SHOT.
	
	                JOEY
	      Hi, Vickie.
	
	JAKE watches JOEY kiss VICKIE. VICKIE notices JAKE'S
	reaction.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What's the matter with you?
	
	                JAKE
	      Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to
	      work. Paid all this money for it
	      and still can't get a station a
	      mile away. And Mr. Wizard here
	      ain't no help.
	
	                JOEY
	      Screw you, Jack.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Vickie)
	      Where you been?
	
	VICKIE goes into the bedroom to take off her coat. On the
	stairs, MOVING SHOT:
	
	                VICKIE
	      I went out.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Joey)
	      What's that kissing on the mouth
	      shit?
	
	                JOEY
	      What? I just said hello. Since when
	      I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
	
	                JAKE
	      Ain't a cheek ever good enough for
	      you? I never even kissed Mama on
	      the mouth.
	
	                JOEY
	      Well, you're not supposed to kiss
	      your mother on the mouth.
	
	                JAKE
	      Well, that's what I mean.
	
	JAKE leans over the TV.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      How's that?
	
	                JOEY
	      I can't tell. You're stomach's in
	      the way.
	
	JAKE stares at JOEY.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Don't give me those looks. I'm just
	      your manager. The minute you start
	      to be champ, you start eating like
	      there's no tomorrow. And you giving
	      me looks. All I know is that I
	      don't have to defend my title next
	      month.
	
	JAKE looks up at JOEY.
	
	                JAKE
	      Answer me somethin'. What happened
	      at the Copa with Salvy when I was
	      out of town?
	
	                JOEY
	      When?
	
	                JAKE
	      You know, when you gave him a
	      beatin'.
	
	                JOEY
	           (being as vague as
	           possible)
	      Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He
	      was drunk or somethin', I dunno.
	      Anyway, the windup was I gave him a
	      beatin'. Tommy called me down, and
	      we straightened it out. It's all
	      forgotten about.
	
	                JAKE
	      Why didn't you tell me about it?
	
	                JOEY
	      It didn't have nothin' to do with
	      you.
	
	                JAKE
	      Didn't it have nothin' to do with
	      me?
	
	                JOEY
	      No, I just told you what happened.
	
	                JAKE
	           (he obviously knows)
	      Who did it have anything to do
	      with... Vickie?
	
	                JOEY
	      Jack, no. I just explained the
	      whole thing to you. It was just
	      between me and Salvy, if it had
	      anything to do with you and Vickie,
	      I woulda told you about it.
	
	                JAKE
	      Well, I heard some things.
	
	MOVING in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.
	
	                JOEY
	      "You heard some things." Will you
	      stop worryin' about that shit?
	      Forget about it. You know you got a
	      title fight comin' up.
	
	PAUSE.
	
	                JOEY
	           (refering to the TV)
	      Whatever you touched, that's good
	      now.
	
	                JAKE
	      Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
	
	                JOEY
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      You're supposed to keep an eye on
	      her for me. I'm askin'...
	
	                JOEY
	           (interrupting)
	      I did keep an eye...
	
	                JAKE
	      Then why did you give him a beatin'
	      if he didn't do anything? You and
	      him been friends a long time.
	
	                JOEY
	      Some things changed between us.
	      Now, he thinks who the fuck he is.
	      He's been passing certain remarks
	      that I don't like.
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't
	      tellin' me the truth.
	
	                JOEY
	      What bullshit? Hey, I'm your
	      brother. You wanna believe me - you
	      trust me?
	
	                JAKE
	      When it comes to her, I don't trust
	      nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
	
	                JOEY
	      Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm
	      tellin" you what happened. He got
	      outta line, we had a fight, and
	      it's staightened out now.
	
	There is a pause. (Move in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.)
	
	                JAKE
	           (suspicious)
	      You givin' me that look. I gotta
	      accept your word, but if I find out
	      anythin', I'm gonna kill
	      somebody...
	
	                JOEY
	           (yelling)
	      So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill
	      Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy
	      Como, kill me while you're at it.
	      What do I care? You're killing
	      yourself the way you're eating, the
	      way you worry about things you
	      don't have to worry about.
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      What do you mean, "you"?
	
	                JOEY
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting, catching
	           Joey)
	      What do you mean, "you"?
	
	                JOEY
	           (caught)
	      I meant, kill everybody. You or me
	      or anybody. You're a big shot.
	      Kill, kill... g'head.
	
	                JAKE
	      But you said "you."
	
	                JOEY
	      So what?
	
	                JAKE
	      Eh, Joey, even you don't know what
	      you meant. You mentioned Salvy,
	      Tommy Como, you -- that means
	      somethin'. Why'd you say them? You
	      coulda said anybody.
	
	                JOEY
	      You're worried about this girl,
	      you're gonna let this girl ruin
	      you're life for you... You wanna
	      worry, worry about your fuckin'
	      stomach that you can't bend over --
	      that you gotta step in the ring in
	      a month.
	
	                JAKE
	      Did you ever fuck my wife?
	
	                JOEY
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      I don't mean now. I mean before --
	      before we met.
	
	                JOEY
	      Whadda ya mean?
	
	                JAKE
	      Did you ever fuck my wife?
	
	                JOEY
	      Whatsa matter with you?
	
	                JAKE
	      You're very smart, Joey, very
	      smart. Nobody gives me a straight
	      answer around here.
	      You're givin' me these answers, but
	      you still didn't answer my
	      question. Did you fuck Vickie?
	
	                JOEY
	           (fed up, he starts to
	           leave)
	      I gotta go. I gotta get outta here.
	      I can't take this shit. Lenore is
	      waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're
	      a definite wacko. You're fuckin'
	      crazy, you know that, crazy.
	
	JAKE'S P.O.V., MOVING SHOT as JOEY leaves. JAKE goes into the
	bedroom.
	
	INT. THE BEDROOM
	
	JAKE walks over to VICKIE. (MOVE in on VICKIE - JAKE'S P.O.V.
	becomes her shot.)
	
	                JAKE
	      Where you been all day?
	
	                VICKIE
	      I took the kids to my sister's.
	
	                JAKE
	      I called. You weren't there.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I got bored so I went to the
	      movies.
	
	                JAKE
	      What'd you see?
	
	                VICKIE
	      I went to the movies.
	
	                JAKE
	      What'd you see?
	
	                VICKIE
	      "Father of the Bride."
	
	                JAKE
	      What was it about?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I
	      have to tell you everything?
	
	                JAKE
	      Did you ever go to the Copa when I
	      was away?
	
	                VICKIE
	      What're you talking about?
	
	                JAKE
	      Answer me when I talk to you. What
	      happened that night?
	
	                VICKIE
	           (interrupting, yelling)
	      I am answering...
	
	                JAKE
	           (hits her)
	      What do I have to do to get a
	      straight answer around here.
	
	JAKE holds onto her, but she gets away.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake, no --
	
	                JAKE
	           (as he chases her around
	           the room)
	      Do I have to kill you, eh?
	           (hits her)
	      Do I have to kill somebody to get
	      an answer?
	           (hits her)
	      I know about you at the Copa. I
	      know all about it.
	
	JAKE catches her.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I didn't do anything wrong. I
	      swear. I just had a few drinks.
	
	                JAKE
	           (pins her down, hits her)
	      With Salvy, eh?
	
	                VICKIE
	      I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy
	      was there.
	           (gets hit)
	      Stop it. I just had a drink, that's
	      all. I didn't do anything wrong.
	           (gets hit)
	
	VICKIE escapes and locks herself in the bathroom.
	
	                JAKE
	           (by bathroom door)
	      Come out of there! Did you fuck
	      Salvy?
	           (punches door)
	      Answer me. Open this fuckin' door,
	      you fuckin' cunt!
	           (punches door)
	      Who've you been fuckin'?
	
	                VICKIE
	           (from inside bathroom)
	      Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
	
	                JAKE
	      You're a fuckin' liar.
	
	He breaks down the door.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Who've you been fuckin'? Salvy?
	           (hits her)
	      Tommy Como?
	           (hits her)
	      I can't trust nobody.
	           (hits her)
	      Did you fuck Joey?
	           (hits her)
	      Who you been fuckin'?
	
	She finally manages to push him away.
	
	                VICKIE
	      All right, I fucked everybody! Go
	      ahead, kill me, kill me.
	
	VICKIE takes JAKE's hand and hits herself. JAKE is stunned.
	
	                VICKIE (CONT'D)
	      I'll say anything you want me to
	      say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked
	      Tommy. I fucked your brother. I
	      fucked everybody! What do you want
	      to hear? I sucked your brother's
	      fuckin' cock!
	
	                JAKE
	      You did?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Yeah, I sucked his cock.
	
	JAKE starts to walk away. VICKIE goes after him.
	
	JAKE is gone.
	
	INT. JOEY'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - DAY
	
	JOEY is at the kitchen table eating lunch with his family.
	His wife, LENORE, her hair done up in pin curls, sits next to
	him. JOEY's TWO KIDS sit across the table from them,
	bickering.
	
	                JOEY
	           (to kids)
	      Don't hit your brother! Be nice.
	
	Suddenly, JAKE comes through the front door, goes directly to
	the table, grabs JOEY, lifts him into the air, and starts
	hitting him.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Jake, stop it.
	
	JAKE keeps hitting JOEY. The KIDS start to cry. LENORE wants
	to stop the fight, but is afraid to get too close.
	
	                JAKE
	      Was Vickie part of the deal with
	      Tommy? Was my wife part of the
	      deal? Tell me, was that it?
	
	                JOEY
	      Stop it. What're you, crazy?
	
	JAKE drags JOEY into the living room, and pushes him onto the
	floor.
	
	                JAKE
	           (kneeling over Joey and
	           hitting him)
	      You didn't tell me. You didn't tell
	      me. You let me marry her. You let
	      me marry her.
	
	VICKIE rushes into the house, past LENORE and the TWO KIDS
	who are screaming even louder now.
	
	                VICKIE
	           (hitting Jake on his back
	           as he hits Joey)
	      You're killing him. You're killing
	      him for nothing. Stop it.
	
	                JAKE
	           (hits her)
	      Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you
	      mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
	
	                VICKIE
	           (still hitting Jake)
	      Nothing is what I said! Go on, kull
	      me.
	           (hits him)
	      Kill me.
	           (hits him)
	      I'm not afraid of you anymore. I
	      don't care if you kill me like
	      you're killing him. You're a sick
	      animal.
	
	JOEY is knocked out. LENORE goes over to him and holds him.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Vickie)
	      You're the fuckin' animal! You ran
	      around with every guy I knew while
	      I was breakin' my ass for you.
	
	                VICKIE
	           (as she pushes and hits
	           Jake to the front door)
	      You're not only an animal, you're a
	      stupid animal.
	           (pushes and hits him out
	           the front door)
	      You're rotten.
	           (hits him)
	      Rotten.
	           (hits him)
	      Rotten.
	           (hits him)
	      You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You
	      belong in a mental hospital.
	
	EXT. JOEY'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - DAY
	
	VICKIE gives JAKE a final push out the door and then slams it
	in his face.
	
	JAKE is left alone on the front steps.
	
	                                    DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. JAKE'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY

	JAKE sits alone in the darkness.
	
	VICKIE lets herself in. She comes and stands behind him.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Well, he ain't dead in case you're
	      interested.
	           (pause)
	      I'm leaving you. And I don't care
	      if you do try to kill me. Go ahead.
	      I'm not afraid of you anymore.
	      There's worse things than being
	      dead and one of them's living with
	      you --
	           (pause)
	      I'm leaving tonight. I must have
	      been crazier than you are for
	      stayin' with you this long. You're
	      hopeless. You're not gonna let

	      Aw, Vickie, aw Vickie, please no.
	      Vickie, no... don't leave me.

	      know all the bad things, but I need
	      you. I'm a bum without you and the

	The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told
	through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER. JAKE is
	not doing well.
	
	                RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER
	      ... Ladies and gentlemen, I've sat
	      in front of these microphones for
	      over twenty years but this is the
	      strangest championship bout I've
	      ever seen. With two minutes to go
	      in the final round, the champion,
	      the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is
	      just simply taking punch after
	      punch from the challenger.
	      Dauthuille scores a combination,
	      then backpedals. LaMotta pursues
	      him. One minute to go. Laurent
	      DauthuiLlle, who has already beat
	      Lamotta in a non-title bout, is
	      about to fulfill a dream -- to
	      bring the middleweight crown back
	      to France.
	
	In the ring, JAKE looks like he's on queer street. Bouncing
	off the ropes, opening his jaw to DAUTHUILLE. But
	DAUTHUILLE's punches lack strength. JAKM is playing possum.
	
	                RINGSIDE'ANNOUNCER
	      Thirty seconds to go. The Bull
	      starts to swing. LaMotta comes in
	      for a brutal body combinaticn: one,
	      two, three, four punches. LaMotta
	      has landed a solid left hook to the
	      Frenchman's jaw! Dauthuille seems
	      confused. LaMotta is swinging
	      wildly now: right, left, right,
	      left! Dauthuille is backing off!
	      Everyone is on their feet! I can
	      hardly see, ladies and gentlemen.
	      Dauthuille is on the ropes. LaMotta
	      hits a right -- Dauthuille is down!
	      Dauthuille is down! Referee Lou
	      Handler is counting him out --
	      three, four, five -- if Dauthuille
	      can stand, he'll win the decision --
	      eight, nine --  Dauthuille is on
	      one knee -- ten! It's all over!
	      With thirteen seconds left on the
	      clock, Jake LaMotta has retained
	      his middleweight championship in
	      one of the most remarkable combacks
	      in boxing! Dauthuille is standing
	      now, confused. But the fight is
	      over.
	
	AN ANNOUNCER holds up JAKE's victorious hand. He seems as
	surprised as everyone else.
	
	TONY throws JAKE'S robe around his shoulders as THE ANNOUNCER
	calls out:
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      The middleweight champion, and
	      still champion by a knockout in
	      fifteen rounds, the Bronx Bull, the
	      Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta!
	
	The CROWD cheers. JAKE raises his arms in victory.

	      I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Why don't you just call him?
	
	                JAKE
	      I dunno.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Tell him how you feel -- you miss
	      him. Tell him you're sorry.
	
	                JAKE
	           (pauze)
	      Ok, all right. Telephone's in the
	      hall. Dial his number.
	
	VICKIE goes to the pay phone in the hall, and dials long
	distance.
	
	JAKE is nervous, but follows VICKIE.

	      As the number starts to ring,
	      VICKIE hands the phone to JAKE.

	      Hello... hello...
	
	JAKE can't answer.

	      Well, if there's somebody

	There is a click as JOEY hangs up.
	
	JAKE stands there, and finally hangs up the phone.

	JAKE gulps down the last of his Scotch.
	
	                JAKE
	           (continuing his monologue)
	      I shoulda never hit my brother.
	      Afterwards I was sorry. Now every
	      time I need somethin' I gotta go
	      shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
	      once told me, "When you hit your
	      brother you're really hittin' your
	      mother but you can't admit it to
	      yourself." He's really crazy. I
	      woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
	      only in self-defense! A lot of
	      people wanta know who was the best
	      guy I ever fought. Let's see...
	      there was that one I fought
	      twice... the other Frenchman... you
	      know who I mean...
	           (having trouble
	           pronouncing the name)
	      ... Dauthuille! He was tough, but I
	      beat him... I had to! I mean, how
	      would it sound losin' to a guy
	      whose name you can't even
	      pronounce? But... Robinson. I can
	      say that alright. I fought Sugar
	      Ray so many times it's a wonder I
	      don't have diabetes! Linda... get
	      me another drink! Linda's the most
	      popular waitress here... you can
	      tell by her tips! She's the kinda

	      ... Thanks, babe. She's a nice kid.
	      She'll only do it with a guy if she
	      really likes him. She's got a lot
	      in common with Will Rogers -- never
	      met a man she didn't like! ... I

	      LaMotta's on queer street, but he's

	      right, a left, a right, a right and
	      a right again! How can LaMotta stay
	      on his feet?
	
	On the TV, WE SEE that ROBINSON has JAKE up against the
	ropes. He's giving JAKE a pier six beating. It's the Fox
	fight for real.
	
	JAKE's face is so soaked in blood that it's impossible to
	pinpoint the cuts.
	
	                TV ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
	      No man can take this kind of
	      punishment. LaMotta is just a rag
	      doll now. God knows what's holding
	      him up. This is an historic
	      beating. Sugar Rav staggers LaMotta
	      with a left and comes across with a
	      blackjack punch to the champion's
	      head. The referee is stepping in,
	      Robinson has LaMotta on the ropes.
	      That's it! Sugar Ray Robinson,
	      former welterweight champion, has

	           (joking)
	      Sorry, empty! Heh, heh! Oh, I
	      didn't mean that. If I don't give
	      your husband no money, he won't
	      have enough to buy you a drink. To
	      show you I'm a nice guy, this one's
	      on me. The last one was your
	      payment for this month.
	
	BRONSON is embarrassed. He doesn't think the joke is funny,
	but he manages a smile. His WIFE gives a nervous laugh. JAKE
	leans over and kisses her.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      You're a good sport, lady.
	
	                J.R.
	      I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in
	      '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were
	      great.
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
	
	                J.R.
	      Where's your wife, Jake?
	
	                JAKE
	      Do you think I'd let her in a place
	      like this with guys like you
	      hangin' around?
	
	JAKE feigns a few jabs, and they all laugh. He walks off.
	
	As JAKE leaves, J.R. whispers to his FRIEND:
	
	                J. R.
	      You ought to see his wife.
	
	JAKE steps over to a table where some of the "BOYS" are
	sitting. RICKY is the Miami 1956 version of Salvy.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, Ricky, glad you came.
	
	                RICKY
	      Wouldn't miss it, Jake.
	
	JAKE calls a WAITRESS over.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, honey, give these fellas a
	      round on me. I can tell they're
	      gonna be regular customers.
	
	The WAITRESS says to a clearly underaged GIRL:
	
	                WAITRESS
	      I'll have to ask for your I.D.
	
	JAKE leans over and gives the young GIRL a long kiss on the
	lips. She enthusiastically reciprocates.
	
	                JAKE
	      Whew! Any girl that can kiss like
	      that can drink in my club any time!
	
	They all laugh as JAKE moves on. The life of the party.
	
	EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - DAY
	
	JAKE, hungover, his tux wrinkled, walks out of the club to
	the adjacent parking lot.
	
	VICKIE is sitting in her yellow Cadillac outside the Club.
	The curbside window is halfway up. She calls to him:
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake.
	
	JAKE, chagrined, steps over to the car.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm sorry. I had to work late last
	      night. Slept at the club.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I'm leaving your Jake.
	
	                JAKE
	      Sure, what else is new?
	
	                VICKIE
	      No. This time it's true. I didn't
	      bother to tell you until I had
	      everything worked out.
	
	JAKE tries to open the door. It's locked.
	
	                JAKE
	      Open the door, Vickie.
	
	                VICKIE
	      No. I won't talk to you where you
	      can use your hands on me.
	
	                JAKE
	      Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting
	      a divorce. I'm getting custody of
	      the kids.
	
	                JAKE
	      Aw, c'mon, Vick --
	
	                VICKIE
	      I'm sick of it. I can't watch you
	      this way. You're too drunk all the
	      time. There's too many girls. I
	      can't... I don't wanna talk about
	      it. I made up my mind.
	
	JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power
	switch, closing it and catching his hand. She now has to yell
	to him:
	
	                VICKIE (CONT'D)
	      You got three days to get your
	      stuff out of the house. After that,
	      the cops will be there. I have the
	      kids with me. I never want to see
	      you again.
	
	VICKIE turns her face and drives away.
	
	JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger
	than him.
	
	JAKE is left alone in the parking lot. The car is gone.
	
	INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - DAY (JAN. 9, 1957)
	
	JAKE has an office above the lounge. Ever since VICKIE left,
	it's also been his apartment.
	
	The place is a mess. JAKE sends his laundry out when he runs
	out of clean clothes. Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are
	scattered randomly. Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty
	beer cans in the wastebasket.
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	      Let's go, Jake, wake up!
	
	                JAKE
	      Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	           (showing badge)
	      We're from...
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      I know where you're from. You guys
	      look the same every place.
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	      They wanna talk to you.
	
	                JAKE
	      About what?
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	      I don't run the joint. They just
	      told me to bring you in.
	
	                JAKE
	      For what?
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      C'mon, get dressed.
	
	JAKE hunts for his clothes.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, I'm a big tax payer down here.
	      Don't that entitle me to some
	      information what this is all about?
	
	The SECOND DEPUTY shows JAKE a photo.
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      You recognize this girl? She been
	      in the club?
	
	                JAKE
	      I dunno.
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      She says you introduced her to men.
	
	                JAKE
	      I introduced a lot of people to
	      men. So what? What does that mean?
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      She's fourteen.
	
	CLOSE UP of picture.
	
	EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
	
	JAKE, wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the
	bell.
	
	VICKIE opens the door and looks at him over the chain.
	
	                JAKE
	      Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Are you drunk?
	
	                JAKE
	      No. Open the door.
	
	JAKE tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but
	she steps back.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Please, Vick. I won't bother you.
	      I'm out on bail. You can send the
	      kids next door. I just gotta pick
	      one thing up, then I'll get outa
	      here.
	
	VICKIE thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets JAKE in.
	
	                VICKIE
	      The kids are sleeping.
	
	                JAKE
	      I promise I just gotta pick up one
	      thing.
	
	                VICKIE
	      All right, just don't make any
	      noise.
	
	INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
	
	JAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE
	watches from a safe distance.
	
	JAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the
	glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.
	
	In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a
	drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts
	digging the jewels out of it.
	
	VICKIE appears in the doorway.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What are you doing?
	
	                JAKE
	      I need ten thousand dollars. My
	      lawyer says if we can spread ten
	      thousand bucks around, we can get
	      the case dropped.
	
	                VICKIE
	      But they don't have a case against
	      you.
	
	                JAKE
	           (digging at the belt)
	      Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a
	      14-year-old testify in court? Did
	      you see the papers? "LaMotta on
	      Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot
	      at the Champ.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake, be careful! What're you doing
	      to the belt?!
	
	                JAKE
	      Don't make no difference no more.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Can't you get the money from your
	      friends?
	
	                JAKE
	      What friends?
	
	JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers
	at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.
	JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.
	
	INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY
	
	JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The
	JEWELER examines the stones.
	
	                JEWELER
	      Didn't you also wish to sell the
	      Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?
	
	                JAKE
	      That's it. Those are the jewels
	      that were in the belt.
	
	                JEWELER
	      But where's the belt?
	
	                JAKE
	      You want the jewels or the belt?
	
	                JEWELER
	      Both. These stones are worth about
	      fifteen hudred dollars, but the
	      belt of a champion is a very rare
	      item. The belt with the stones
	      untouched would have been worth
	      near five thousand dollars.
	
	JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the
	attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.
	
	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
	
	JAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.
	
	                JAKE
	           (on phone)
	      I can't raise the ten thousand.
	      Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.
	
	INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Same as Scene 1.
	
	JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated
	across from a mirror.
	
	                JAKE
	      So there I am in the can... and not
	      the one that says "gentlemen" on
	      the door. I'm talkin' about jail!
	      Down south!
	      I mean, jail up north is gotta be
	      like summer camp compared to jail
	      down in cracker country. And if
	      you're a guy like me, you ain't got
	      a chance in a place like that.
	      Especially if you're Italian... you
	      come from the Bronx... and you're
	      an ex-champ. As soon as they saw
	      me... soon as they heard me... I
	      know I'm in trouble. To me, they
	      got an accent, and to them, I got
	      an accent! You gotta get the
	      picture -- I'm big, I got small
	      hands, I walk like I'm still in the
	      ring... the balls of my feet pop up
	      and down, you know... and whenever
	      I get the chance, I read a lot. So
	      naturally, takin' all this into
	                                      co
	      sideration, they figure it adds up
	      to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I
	      didn't mind too much when they
	      called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough
	      Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one
	      day these screws got to me... I was
	      workin' on the work gang, pickin'
	      up some trees that were knocked
	      down by a storm or somethin' and
	      puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a
	      sudden... one of the trees slipped
	      and fell on me and pinned me to the
	      ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree
	      across my chest! This screw walks
	      over, takin' his time, he looks
	      down at me and says, "Well, Champ
	      Pimp... you lyin' down on the job
	      again?"! They got a great sense of
	      humor when they're standin' there
	      with a gun in their arms and you
	      got a tree on your chest! So I look
	      up at him and say, "Oh, this
	      tree... it fell on me." And he
	      says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have
	      known, I would've yelled 'timber'"
	      I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I
	      think maybe I broke somethin'!" He
	      says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ
	      PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then
	      I got as stupid as him. I said, "If
	      I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'
	      me the money you made last night?"!
	      Then another screw comes over and
	      says, "This Yankee creep givin' you
	      trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?
	      What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with
	      the tree? Now anybody else in their
	      right mind would've said, "No sir,
	      I wouldn't think of giving any of
	      you gentlemen trouble... I just
	      want to serve my time and get the
	      hell out of here as soon as I can."
	      That's anybody else. When I said
	      it... it was a little different.
	      "You stupid cracker... take your
	      hands off me or I'll get up and
	      kick your brains out -- but first
	      you gotta bend over so I can find
	      'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the
	      hole. Solitary confinement. All my
	      life I had guys in my corner
	      yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill
	      'em! You're the greatest." Now
	      there's nobody rootin' for me. But
	      it wasn't so bad. I learned things
	      there. I learned how to scratch a
	      calendar on the wall. I never knew
	      how to do that before. Now I know.
	      Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is
	      two scratches. Wednesday is three
	      scratches. And so on. Except for
	      Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.
	      Sundays rested.
	
	INT. DADE COUNTY STOCKADE - DAY
	
	The CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade
	County Prison. Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.
	
	JAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and
	legs are manacled and chained.
	
	The GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in
	working JAKE over.
	
	They take JAKE to the "Hole" -- solitary confinement.
	
	ONE of the GUARDS unmanacles JAKE.
	
	Both GUARDS push JAKE into the cell and slam the door.
	
	INT. THE HOLE - DAY OR NIGHT
	
	A thin slit provides the only light in JAKE's cell.
	
	The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti. The
	8x8x8 room features only a cot and a toilet.
	
	The room is mostly darkness. Sounds are more tangible here
	than sights.
	
	WE SEE JAKE's body as it passes through the slit of light.
	
	JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light. As WE SEE
	JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear.
	
	(There will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the
	images: for example, the image of JAKE hitting VICKIE might
	be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.)
	
	A) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men
	and women engaged in explicit sex acts.
	
	B) Boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. A
	body building ad: Charles Atlas raises his muscled biceps.
	
	C) Li'l Abner comics; Daisy Mae's tits seem about to fall
	free.
	
	D) Reprise from earlier scene: Back in JAKE and IRMA's old
	apartment, JOEY, using a towel as a glove, punches JAKE in
	the face.
	
	E) A 1934 "OLDER GIRL" sashays into the candy store in
	flickering 8mm black and white footage. WE SEE ohter Bronx
	PRETEEN GIRLS walking, smiling.
	
	F) At Shorehaven pool, JAKE and JOEY, in bathing suits, are
	sleeping in the sun next to each other. OTHER BATHERS are
	around, also taking in the sun.
	
	G) Reprise from earlier scene: As in D, JOEY hits JAKE in the
	face again.
	
	WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
	
	The MONTAGE continues:
	
	H) JANIRO's face at the weigh-in.
	
	I) JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss at the weigh-in.
	
	J) JAKE punches in JANIRO's face.
	
	K) A naked GIRL stands in the doorway of a bedroom.
	
	L) JAKE lies in bed with IRMA staring at the ceiling.
	
	M) VICKIE's pretty young face DOUBLE EXPOSES with SUGAR RAY
	ROBINSON's.
	
	N) DR. PINTO injects novacaine into JAKE's fists.
	
	O) Sitting in his corner of the ring, JAKE spits blood into a
	pail...
	
	P) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY wipes off his brother's
	bloody face.
	
	Q) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's
	eye. JOEY, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the
	wound as DR. PINTO begins to examine it.
	
	R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's
	mouth. (SLOW MOTION)
	
	S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE
	on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a
	quick look, but JOEY just embraces him.
	
	T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and
	looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club.
	JAKE stares.
	
	U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face.
	
	V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to
	break it.
	
	W) JAKE hits LINDA again. She cries.
	
	X) Repeat image N: DR. PINTO injects novocaine into JAKE's
	fists.
	
	WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
	
	The MONTAGE continues:
	
	Y) VICKIE is in her underwear in a bedroom. A pair of black
	arms come in and embrace her body.
	
	Z) CLOSE UP of JAKE; he reacts to this. He's in the ring with
	SUGAR RAY. He knocks SUGAR RAY out of the ring.
	
	AA) VICKIE again. JAKE approaches her from behind, pulls her
	head back by her hair, and slaps her.
	
	BB) THE ANNOUNCER points to SUGAR RAY as the winner.
	(Different fight.) CAMERA PANS to RAY, victorious, his arms
	up.
	
	CC) A bloodied JAKE comes over to SUGAR RAY and embraces him.
	
	WE ARE BACK WITH JAKE in the cell. He slowly starts to bang
	his head against the wall.
	
	                JAKE
	           (murmuring)
	      Why, why, why?
	           (with each bang of his
	           head)
	      I'm a man, I'm a man. I'm no
	      faggot. I'm not a faggot. Ma, why?
	      What do they want? My cock's not
	      enough. What do they want from me?
	      Why? Ma? Why?
	
	JAKE is now smashing the wall with all his strength --
	vicious body punches.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Why, why, why me? You took it away
	      from me. They took everything away.
	      What do they want from me? What the
	      fuck do they want from me? I ain't
	      bad. I ain't bad. I'm not that guy.
	      I'm not that guy. I'm not a
	      monster. I'm not an animal.
	
	JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.
	
	JAKE collapses to the concrete floor. His hands are smashed.
	He cries, then sobs.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      I'm not like that. Please. I'm not
	      like that. Please. Please. Please.
	
	Then silence.
	
	We begin to hear: JAKE doing a monologue.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      And so, as Shakespeare said, I've
	      been down so low there's nowhere
	      else to go.
	
	INT. METROPOLE - NIGHT (1958)
	
	The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square.
	
	JAKE LAMOTTA, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit,
	continues his monologue.
	
	                JAKE
	      Except here, gentlemen, with you
	      bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but
	      you know what you really are! You
	      know, this place used to be pretty
	      exclusive... now they got bouncers
	      outside to throw the drunks in! My
	      first night here I said to the
	      boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He
	      said, "You're in it!" By the way,
	      this engagement is just a stepping
	      stone for me. If I do good here,
	      I'm ready to get out of the
	      business!
	
	The CROWD starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage!"
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      OK, OK, I know what you're waitin'
	      for -- and from the looks of you,
	      you been waitin' for it for a long
	      time. I had my own joint in Miami
	      Beach once... it was too high-class
	      for you guys... we had a 50-cent
	      minimum charge just to keep out the
	      riff-raff!
	
	The CROWD continues to shout, as before, also shouting:
	"Bring out the girls!"
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Hey, sorry. Here's your girls.
	           (grabs his crotch)
	      Yeah, she's here... just like it's
	      advertised out front. She's come
	      back. A girl who's seen the Lower
	      Depths... who's been as far as I
	      have in that direction. She's on
	      her way back up now... give you an
	      idea how low she was! Let's give
	      her a warm welcome... make her glad
	      she's back, boys. -- Miss Emma
	      48's!
	
	JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her
	dance. He goes over to the bar and gets a drink. SEVERAL
	OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at
	the bar.
	
	EXT. METROPOLE - NIGHT
	
	The Club is closing. JAKE and EMMA, the stripper, come out
	and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot.
	
	JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen.
	
	                JAKE
	      Look, sweetie, be a good girl.
	      Here's some money. Take a cab. Go
	      home by yourself. Just wanna walk
	      around a little, sort of unwind.
	      OK?
	
	                EMMA
	      Will I see you later?
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah. I dunno... I'll call you.
	
	JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a
	cab.
	
	                                    DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	
	It's about twenty minutes later.
	
	DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.
	He looks at the delicatessen.
	
	JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing
	JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near
	the rear of the outdoor lot.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, Joey --
	
	JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.
	
	JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts
	to get into his car.
	
	JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,
	      please --
	
	JOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his
	shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Aw, Joey --
	
	JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand
	on JOEY's shoulder again.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      You're right. You're perfectly
	      right. You got every right in the
	      world to hate my guts.
	
	JOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper
	bag into the front seat of the car.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      No, please. I know I was a
	      cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda
	      never raised my hands to you.
	
	JOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car
	again.
	
	JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      No, Joey, listen to me --
	
	JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to
	his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
	open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
	
	JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he
	belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken
	by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.
	
	JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Go ahead.
	           (gets punched)
	      Hit me again.
	           (gets punched)
	      I deserve it...
	           (gets punched)
	      Pay me back...
	           (gets punched)
	      More...
	           (gets punched)
	
	JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure
	it out.
	
	JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.
	
	JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's
	shoulder.
	He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and
	finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to
	fill his eyes.
	
	JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
	
	They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.
	
	EXT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)
	
	The theater lights are flashing.
	
	This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the
	Metropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the
	corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.
	
	A stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An
	Evening with Jake LaMotta." The billboard also lists the
	authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod
	Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.
	
	INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Same as Scenes One and Eighty-One.
	
	JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.
	
	                JAKE
	      You know, I'm not a philosopher or
	      anything like that but I been
	      around a little and the way I look
	      at it is -- We're, all of us,
	      lookin' for the same thing: a shot
	      at the title. No matter what you
	      wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'
	      the best. Well, I had mine and
	      it'll always be in the record
	      books... it don't make no
	      difference what happens to me from
	      here on in -- I got my shot and
	      that's a fact. Some guys weren't
	      that lucky... like the one Marlon
	      Brando played in "On the
	      Waterfront" -- an up and comer
	      who's now a down and outer. You
	      remember... there was this scene in
	      the back of the car with his
	      brother Charlie, a small-time
	      racket guy, and it went somethin'
	      like this -- "It wasn't him,
	      Charlie. It was you. You 'member
	      that night in the Garden you came
	      down my dressing room and said.
	      'Kid, this ain't your night.
	      We're going for the price on
	      Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This
	      ain't your night!' My night -- I
	      coulda taken Wilson apart! So what
	      happens? He gets the title shot
	      outdoors on the ballpark, and what
	      do I get? A one-way ticket to
	      Palookaville. I never was no good
	      after that night. It was like a
	      peak you reach. Then it went
	      downhill. It was you, Charlie. You
	      was my brother, Charlie. You
	      shoulda looked out for me a little
	      bit. You shoulda taken care of me
	      just a little bit so I wouldn't
	      have to take them dives for the
	      short end money... You don't
	      understand! I coulda had class. I
	      coulda been a contender. I coulda
	      been somebody -- instead of a bum,
	      which is what I am. Let's face it.
	      It was you, Charlie."
	
	A shadow goes by the frame; it's a STAGEHAND.
	
	                STAGEHAND (O.S.)
	      Hey Jake, how you doing?
	
	The shadow exits.
	
	                JAKE
	      How long do I have?
	
	The shadow pops in again.
	
	                STAGEHAND (O.S.)
	      About five minutes
	
	The shadow exits.
	
	                JAKE
	      OK.
	
	JAKE pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room.
	
	His breath comes in quick gasps. His feet pop up and down
	like they were on canvas. His tiny fists jerk forward with
	short bursts of light.
	
	Still alive. Still a contender. A 42-year-old man fighting
	for his shot.
	
	The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit
	the empty air -- in and out of the frame.
	
	This quote appears: (Music in)
	  		
	"Verily, verily I say unto thee,
	  Except a man be born again,
	  He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven..."
	
	                                                 John 3-3
	
	The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS.
	
	The END CREDITS roll up.
	
	                       THE END

	WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.
	
	                                   THEN CUT TO:
	
	INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
	
	JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
	
	We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
	shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
	balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
	canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
	bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
	
	               JAKE
	     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	     It's a thrill to be standing here
	     talking to you wonderful people. In
	     fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
	     I haven't seen so many people since
	     my last fight at Madison Square
	     Garden. After that fight, a
	     reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
	     you go from here?' I said, 'To a
	     hospital!' I fought one hundred and
	     six professional fights and still
	     none of them bums figured out how
	     to fight me -- they kept hitting me
	     in the head! And that's why I'm
	     here tonight...
	          (starts to sing)
	     'When the fighter's not engaged in
	     his employment, his employment,
	     although he was Champ and quite the
	     rage, he must go somewhere else to
	     seek employment, seek employment.
	     But a fighter's life is not a bowl
	     of cherries, still I'd rather have
	     an egg than a fist upon my face...
	     That's Entertainment!'
	
	INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
	
	Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,
	19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter
	how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always
	staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
	
	Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
	
	It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.
	Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --
	each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
	
	Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER
	and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
	
	AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
	blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
	him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
	
	               JOEY
	     You didn't have to come to
	     Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan
	     yan," Jake!
	
	               TONY
	     He's got you, Jake! You're
	     outpointed! You're coming up for
	     the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
	
	The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and
	charges at REEVES.
	
	REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
	
	In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
	
	               JOEY
	     A grand apiece! We got a grand
	     apiece on this, Jake! A fucking
	     grand!
	
	JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild
	alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
	
	The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
	
	REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
	
	The REFEREE counts:
	
	               REFEREE
	     One, two, three, four...
	
	The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the
	underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and
	steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending
	not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a
	few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
	not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
	count of nine, ending the match.
	
	Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
	get their money.
	
	JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting
	them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
	
	The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:
	
	               ANNOUNCER
	     Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,
	     under the rules of the Cleveland
	     Boxing Commission, after ten
	     rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy
	     Reeves.
	
	The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to
	lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS
	bring in a stretcher.
	
	JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to
	figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and
	the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting
	with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.
	PEOPLE go into the ring.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Jake)
	     Don't get out of the ring. You won
	     the fight -- let him go out first.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	REEVES being placed on the stretcher.
	
	A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to
	play the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.
	
	Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.
	
	EXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY
	
	It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare
	cases and street kids.
	
	In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange
	words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY
	and JOEY turn the corner.
	
	               JOEY
	     Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
	     Let's say that's the truck; it's
	     full of cigarettes, right? Now, two
	     o'clock this morning we move the
	     truck from here to there,
	          (he points; the CAMERA
	          PANS)
	     take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,
	     make some cash.
	
	               SALVY
	     Hey but Joey, you're thinking
	     nickels and dimes. The money's with
	     your brother.
	
	               JOEY
	     What do you want from my life,
	     Salvy? He's my brother.
	
	               SALVY
	     He ain't doin' the right thing.
	     He's makin' beans compared to what
	     he should be makin'. Can't you make
	     him understand that?
	
	A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to cop)
	     Hey, leave the kids alone.
	
	               SALVY
	     Get lost.
	          (joking, he knows the Cop)
	     Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."
	     Remember that, "A rat."
	
	The KIDS yell.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Cop)
	     Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your
	     trouble. There's some bums around
	     the corner -- they need your help.
	
	               COP
	     Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself
	     a new suit.
	
	               JOEY
	          (laughs)
	     Here's my new suit.
	          (grabs his crotch)
	     Right here.
	
	               COP
	     Hey, don't get wise!
	
	               JOEY
	     Just kidding, take it easy.
	          (to himself)
	     No fuckin' sense of humor.
	
	SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
	
	JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits
	at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while
	his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
	
	JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
	
	               JAKE
	     This looks done.
	
	               IRMA
	     It's not done.
	
	               JAKE
	     It looks done. I'll take it the way
	     it is.
	
	               IRMA
	     Here's your steak. You can't wait
	     for it to be done. Here.
	
	She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the
	stove.
	
	               IRMA (CONT'D)
	     Here's your carrots. You're in such
	     a hurry. You can't wait.
	
	               JAKE
	     No, I can't wait. You know when I
	     wait? When it's important to wait.
	     It's not important to wait for no
	     steak. It's important to wait for
	     Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't
	     important to wait for no steak! I
	     won that fight. So, I stayed in the
	     ring, and that way I made sure
	     everybody knew it. I shoulda
	     knocked him out earlier,
	     sonofabitch.
	
	He starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell
	     you, if this steak was the
	     middleweight championship, I'd show
	     you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw.
	     I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it
	     before it came out of the cow --
	     that's how I'd wait.
	
	EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY
	
	SALVY and JOEY approach the building.
	
	               JOEY
	     I can't convince him. He's got such
	     a thick head, I'd like to crack it
	     open myself. Believe me, my own
	     brother. It's very hard. You don't
	     have to convince me -- I know we
	     should be with Tommy. You talk to
	     him. He don't listen to nobody.
	
	               SALVY
	     Look, I'm just tellin' you how
	     Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard
	     on himself. Tommy wants him with
	     us. It's as simple as that.
	
	They stop at the doorway.
	
	               SALVY (CONT'D)
	     Talk some sense into him, will ya?
	     You're still his brother.
	     If he ain't gonna listen to you, he
	     ain't gonna listen to nobody!
	
	               JOEY
	     All right, I'll try. See you later.
	
	               SALVY
	     Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
	
	               JOEY
	     Right, the gym.
	
	SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
	
	JOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.
	
	               JOEY
	          (noticing Jake)
	     What's the matter?
	
	               IRMA
	     He's doing it again.
	
	               JOEY
	          (goes to Jake)
	     What's the matter? You're drinking.
	     You're eating like an animal.
	
	JOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink
	in his hand, and tears on his face.
	
	               JOEY (CONT'D)
	     What's wrong?
	
	               JAKE
	          (gets up)
	     Nothing...
	
	JAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY
	follows JAKE.
	
	INT. LIVING ROOM
	
	JOEY walks up to JAKE.
	
	               JOEY
	     Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
	
	               JAKE
	          (privately, to Joey)
	     I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis,
	     that's what's the matter.
	
	               JOEY
	     What're you talking about? He's a
	     heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
	
	JAKE holds out his scarred hands.
	
	               JAKE
	     Look at these hands. These fuckin'
	     hands. I was born with a girl's
	     hands. And even if I put on enough
	     weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be
	     too slow to fight. No matter how
	     big I get, I'll never be big enough
	     to fight Louis.
	
	JAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.
	
	               JOEY
	     That's what I'm sayin'. You
	     shouldn't even think like that.
	     It's crazy.
	
	               JAKE
	     I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll
	     never be big enough to fight Louis,
	     but I know Joey, I know...
	
	               JOEY
	     You know?
	
	               JAKE
	     Yeah. Do me a favor.
	
	               JOEY
	     Sure. What is it?
	
	               JAKE
	     Hit me in the face.
	
	               JOEY
	          (after a pause)
	     You want me to do what?
	
	               JAKE
	     You heard me, I said hit me.
	
	               JOEY
	     C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your
	     best shot. On the jaw.
	
	               JOEY
	     Jack, I got no gloves.
	
	               JAKE
	          (grabs a nearby towel)
	     Here's your glove.
	
	JOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE
	with his right. JAKE holds fast.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Go ahead. Hit me. C'mon, don't
	     worry about it. I want you to hit
	     me with everything you got.
	
	JOEY hauls off and lands him a real belt. JAKE rolls with it
	and stands firm.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Again. Harder.
	
	JOEY hits him again.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Harder. Go 'head.
	
	JOEY hits him again.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Harder.
	          (grabs the towel)
	     Take the towel off.
	
	               JOEY
	     Jack! Enough!
	
	               JAKE
	     Go ahead.
	
	JOEY hits him again. JAKE holds fast. JAKE starts to walk
	away.
	
	               JOEY
	     What was that for? I know you can
	     take punches. I can hit you from
	     now to doomsday. What the fuck does
	     that prove?
	
	               JAKE
	     See that, I don't feel it. I can
	     take it. I know I can take anybody.
	
	EXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY
	
	Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street
	and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
	
	Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door
	listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is
	posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
	
	INT. GLEASON'S - DAY
	
	Gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags.
	About a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's.
	For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the
	workouts.
	
	JAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working
	out for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round.
	JAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound
	again.
	
	At that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON"
	MEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter
	the gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits,
	flashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the
	door. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to
	the ring.
	
	               SALVY
	          (waves)
	     Hey Joey --
	
	JOEY waves back.
	
	               SALVY (CONT'D)
	          (waves again)
	     Jake, how you doin'?
	
	JAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that
	he's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same
	and becomes a bit nervous.
	
	SALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like
	to. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.
	
	JAKE goes to JOEY's corner.
	
	               JAKE
	     Did you know they were coming up
	     here?
	
	JOEY doesn't answer.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Answer me when I talk to you.
	
	               JOEY
	     Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to
	     talk to you. So I...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Don't ever bring those kids up here
	     again! I'm working out, I'm killin'
	     myself in here, and they walk
	     around like they fuckin' own the
	     neighborhood.
	
	SALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They
	begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
	
	The bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners
	JOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block
	them. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
	
	The bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start
	to leave.
	
	               SALVY
	          (to Joey)
	     Hey Joey, we better go. See you
	     later.
	
	JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're
	     your friends.
	
	JAKE watches them leave.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he
	     think he is? I'm gonna let that
	     fuckin' hard-on come up here and
	     act like a big shot.
	
	               JOEY
	     What are you getting so hot about --
	     Tommy Como told him to come down
	     here...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como.
	     I don't care about Jesus Christ on
	     the fuckin' cross. I gotta give
	     them a percentage of what I make!
	     I'm in here breaking my ass, not
	     them. Don't ever bring them up here
	     again.
	
	               JOEY
	     I didn't tell them to come. Tommy
	     Como...
	
	The bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body
	punches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of
	punches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs.
	
	               JAKE
	     That's right, fight back. I got
	     laid three times before I came up
	     here this morning and I can still
	     break your ass.
	
	JOEY fights back, but it's no use.
	
	               JOEY
	     You cocksucker.
	
	JAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY
	watches unseen from the doorway.
	
	EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
	
	The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the
	closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot
	fence stands between the pool and the street.
	
	JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the
	"BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A
	young FAN walks by and says:
	
	               FAN
	     Hey, Jake.
	
	At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and
	sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl,
	about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.
	
	SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS.
	They joke with JOEY.
	
	JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.
	
	JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE
	giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.
	
	               JAKE
	          (referring to Vickie)
	     Who's that?
	
	               JOEY
	     Whadda you care?
	
	               JAKE
	     Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who
	     is she? What's a matter? You afraid
	     I'm gonna take her on you?
	
	               JOEY
	     No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna
	     meet her?
	
	               JAKE
	     Yeah --
	
	               JOEY
	     Cause I'll go right over there and
	     bring her here.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go 'head.
	
	               JOEY
	     You sure you wanna meet her? Don't
	     make me go over there, you change
	     your mind and you make me look bad,
	     cause she's really a knockout.
	     She's 15, this kid -- a great piece
	     of ass.
	
	               JAKE
	     How do you know? You know her that
	     good?
	
	               JOEY
	     No, I see her around the pool. I
	     know her. I know her like that --
	     not like that.
	
	               JAKE
	          (gesturing to his bandage)
	     Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I
	     don't feel right...
	
	JAKE watches VICKIE.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Jake)
	     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
	     know she'll be there.
	
	               JAKE
	     'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
	
	               JOEY
	     How you gonna catch anybody alone
	     at a dance?... I don't know if
	     she'll be there alone... She'll
	     probably be there with her
	     girlfriends or something.
	
	               JAKE
	     She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
	
	               JOEY
	     Nah, she don't go with nobody.
	     She's only 15 years old.
	
	               JAKE
	     What does that have to do with it?
	     She don't look 15 to me. I heard
	     somethin' with Salvy. She was with
	     him once or somethin', I think. It
	     was like some blonde. That's the
	     one...
	
	               JOEY
	     Probably. You know she talks to
	     everybody, and not just him.
	
	               JAKE
	     Yeah, she's nice.
	
	               JOEY
	     Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin'
	     you.
	
	               JAKE
	     You wasn't with her, were you?
	
	               JOEY
	     Huh?
	
	               JAKE
	     You wasn't with her?
	
	               JOEY
	     With her? How?
	
	               JAKE
	     You know, like bang her or
	     anything?
	
	               JOEY
	     Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I
	     know her from around here, that's
	     all. You want to meet her or what?
	
	               JAKE
	     Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons
	     around. I'll wait. Not now.
	
	The scene ends on VICKIE as JAKE watches her.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Jake)
	     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
	     know she'll be there. Dressed up
	     and everything.
	
	               JAKE
	     I don't like all those other clowns
	     around. That's all I know.
	
	               JOEY
	     C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna
	     get outa here tonight.
	
	JOEY sips a drink as JAKE knots his tie. IRMA enters from the
	bedroom.
	
	               IRMA
	     Where you going at this hour?
	
	               JAKE
	     What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out --
	     business.
	
	               IRMA
	     You fuckin' worm, if you're going
	     out, I'm going out.
	
	               JAKE
	     And where you goin'?
	
	               IRMA
	     None of your fuckin' business.
	
	JOEY lifts his eyes up.
	
	               JAKE
	     Eh, go out. Do what you're gonna
	     do. What do I care?
	
	JOEY opens the door to leave. JAKE follows.
	
	               IRMA
	     That's right -- run out. I ain't
	     gonna be here when you get back.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
	
	JAKE and JOEY hurry down the stairs. IRMA shouts after them.
	
	               IRMA
	     Bunch of guys. You all hang out
	     together. Yeah, you're all going
	     out on business. You're all gonna
	     suck each other off.
	
	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - LATE NIGHT
	
	               JOEY
	     What a mouth on her -- you shoulda
	     hit her -- no good fuckin' Jewish
	     cunt -- breakin' our balls. You
	     shoulda hit her with a chair.
	
	               JAKE
	     Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk
	     like that. She's still my wife.
	
	               JOEY
	     No, but Jake... how much abuse can
	     you take.
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     How many times do I have to hit
	     her? I hit her enough.
	
	They exit to street.
	
	EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - STREET - LATE NIGHT
	
	JOEY and JAKE come out of the building and start walking down
	the street.
	
	IRMA opens the window on the second floor right above them,
	and shouts out to them:
	
	               IRMA
	     Go ahead -- that's all you're good
	     for -- to go out and leave me here
	     like a dog. You and your brother!
	     You don't even look like brothers.
	     You look like faggots! That's what
	     you look like -- faggots!
	
	JAKE and JOEY walk faster down the block, pretending that
	IRMA must be shouting at someone else.
	
	She throws a bottle at them. It smashes in the street.
	
	EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT (AN HOUR LATER)
	
	ESTABLISHING SHOT.
	
	INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
	
	A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing
	while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS
	present. The younger people are divided into two groups --
	the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most
	of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in
	evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing
	together.
	
	Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS."
	There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles
	of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables
	are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood
	groups, as if they were street corners.
	
	JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young
	neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk
	to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.
	
	JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This
	little game goes on for a few seconds, then:
	
	               JOEY
	     Look, could you move a little.
	     Would you mind, darling?
	
	               VERA
	     Mind what, Mr. Big Shot?
	
	               JAKE
	          (annoyed)
	     Eh, girlie, take a walk.
	
	JAKE starts to move forward; JOEY stops him.
	
	               JOEY
	          (to Vera)
	     All right, darling, I'll just stand
	     here and wait.
	
	JOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals,
	covers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past
	her. JOEY smiles.
	
	JOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table.
	
	               JAKE
	     Do you see her yet?
	
	               JOEY
	     Give me a chance. Let me look.
	
	MOVING SHOTS
	
	JAKE tries to find her -- Camera pans until we find her. JOEY
	points out a distant table. He spots VICKIE with a couple of
	other GIRLS . VICKIE locks beautiful and is obviously having
	a good time.
	
	               JOEY (CONT'D)
	     THERE she is over there on the
	     other side. What did I tell you?
	     Oh, ain't she nice? Ain't she a
	     fuckin' doll?
	
	As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV:
	
	SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They
	are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are
	obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood
	dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with
	them. They get up to leave.
	
	               JAKE
	     Be right back.
	
	SALVY, FRANKIE, JUNIOR, VTCKIE and the other TWO GIRLS leave
	the dance hall. JAKE, unseen, follows them to the entrance
	way, as they go out onto the sidewalk.
	
	EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
	
	JAKE watches as SALVY ushers everyone into his Cadillac, and
	then drives off.
	
	JAKE stares after the car for a moment, then goes back
	inside.
	
	EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
	
	JAKE and JOEY get out of their Packard convertible and walk
	over to the fence surrounding the pool. VICKIE is by the
	pool.
	
	               JOEY
	          (calling out to Vickie)
	     Hey, Vickie, c'mere. Don't be
	     afraid. C'mere. Just say hello.
	     This is my brother.
	
	VICKIE comes over to the fence.
	
	               JOEY (CONT'D)
	     Vickie, I want you to meet my
	     brother, Jake. He's gonna be the
	     next champ.
	
	JAKE puts his fingers through the fence.
	
	               JAKE
	     Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is
	     that right? You wanted to meet me?
	
	               VICKIE
	          (to Joey)
	     I just wanted to say hello.
	
	               JAKE
	     You wanted to say hello, eh? I
	     can't believe it. When did you fall
	     outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you
	     you're the most beautiful one here,
	     princess of the pool. You got a
	     baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha
	     wanna meet me for?
	
	               VICKIE
	     I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
	
	               JAKE
	          (to Joey)
	     Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face
	     is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now?
	     You wanna go for a ride?
	
	PAN to car.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Sure. Gimme a few minutes.
	
	She starts to go.
	
	               JAKE
	     Hey...
	
	She turns. JAKE kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence
	by her lips.
	
	EXT. SHORE ROAD - DAY
	
	JAKE drives his Packard convertible down Shore Road. VICKIE
	sits in the passenger seat, her blonde hair blowing in the
	wind. VICKIE feels JAKE's eyes all over her, and loves it.
	
	On the radio, Bing Crosby sings "Just One More Charce."
	
	EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY
	
	JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf
	course on Shore Road. The Shore Road course is one of the
	best. The first green features a pink windmill.
	
	JAKE and VICKIE get out to cross the street.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You don't talk very much.
	
	               JAKE
	     I ain't ever talked to a movie star
	     before.
	
	               VICKIE
	          (giggles)
	     I ain't no movie star. I'm just in
	     high school.
	
	               JAKE
	     Oh no? I thought you was a movie
	     star.
	
	A bus heads toward them.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake! The bus!
	
	JAKE holds up his hand.
	
	               JAKE
	     Any bus gives you trouble, I knock
	     it out for ya.
	
	The bus stops for them as they cross the street.
	
	EXT. THE FIRST GREEN - DAY
	
	JAKE sets VICKIE's ball on the tee facing the windmill.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You go first. Let me watch how to
	     do this.
	
	               JAKE
	     You don't get nothin' done by
	     watchin'. You just gotta do it.
	     Here, I'll help you.
	
	JAKE hands VICKIE the putter, then moves behind her and puts
	her hand on the club.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     That's it. Just grip up a little
	     tighter. That's it. You're gonna be
	     real good at this. How does that
	     feel?
	
	               VICKIE
	     It feels real good.
	
	               JAKE
	     Just keep your eye on the ball.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Should I hit it?
	
	               JAKE
	     Just give it a nice little tap.
	
	VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the
	windmill. VICKIE breaks free and follows her ball. JAKE
	follows.
	
	               VICKIE
	     I can't find my ball.
	
	               JAKE
	     Can you see it?
	
	VICKIE bends and looks under the windmill.
	
	               VICKIE
	     No.
	
	JAKE bends and looks.
	
	               VICKIE (CONT'D)
	     Can you see it?
	
	               JAKE
	     No.
	
	               VICKIE
	     What does that mean?
	
	JAKE takes VICKIE by the arm.
	
	               JAKE
	     It means the game is over.
	
	JAKE throws his putter on the next green.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Let's get outa here.
	
	EXT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING - BRONX - DAY
	
	JAKE and VICKIE pull up to a tenement.
	
	JAKE dashes around the car to open the door for VICKIE.
	
	They enter the building.
	
	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY
	
	JOSEPH LAMOTTA, SR. is finishing his Sunday dinner with a
	glass of wine as JAKE and VICKIE enter.
	
	               JAKE
	     Hi Pop. This is my new girlfriend,
	     Vickie. V for victory. How do you
	     like that Pop?
	
	               JOE LAMOTTA
	     V for victory.
	
	               VICKIE
	          (nervous)
	     It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.
	     LaMotta.
	
	               JOE LAMOTTA
	          (in Italian)
	     Sit down. Eat something.
	
	JAKE is anxious. VICKIE is scared.
	
	               JAKE
	     C'mon, Pop. You've been in America
	     so many years. Speak English.
	
	               JOE LAMOTTA
	          (joking)
	     You want me to speak English --
	     Fuck you. That's English.
	
	               JAKE
	     Pop, don't curse. There's a girl
	     here. I'm gonna show her around the
	     house. Why don't you just finish
	     your wine?
	
	JOE stares at him. JAKE grasps VICKIE's arm firmly.
	
	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
	
	The bedroom is a few rooms away from the kitchen. JAKE closes
	the door. (There is a warm light in the bedroom.)
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake, this is your father's
	     bedroom.
	
	               JAKE
	     That's all right. He don't mind.
	
	The room is sparsely furnished. On the bureau, there is a
	large framed photo of the boxing brothers: JAKE and JOEY
	LAMOTTA. (JOEY wears a suit in the picture.)
	
	JAKE puts VICKIE on the bed and removes his jacket and tie.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake...
	
	               JAKE
	     It's OK.
	
	He pushes her against the bed and gently undresses her. They
	make love.
	
	INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 5, 1943)
	
	JAKE is fighting SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. (It's their 2nd match.)
	WE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously,
	but SUGAR RAY is a formidable opponent. AN ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	gives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of
	punishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE
	nails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and
	pounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right
	cross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a
	left to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the
	ropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.
	SUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,
	while the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.
	
	TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the winner.
	JAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.
	
	INT. GLEASON'S - DAY (1943)
	
	JAKE's press conference.
	
	FIVE REPORTERS meander around the gym, waiting for JAKE to
	finish sparring. They are not thrilled with their assignment.
	JAKE is not thrilled with having them there.
	
	The gallery is spotted with the usual BRONX TYPES. The lone
	exception is VICKIE, dressed very well, very sensual, and
	quite content to watch JAKE make his SPARRING PARTNERS' lives
	miserable, despite their head and belly protectors.
	
	JOEY is off in one of the corners arguing with ONE of the
	REPORTERS:
	
	               JOEY
	     The fuckin' papers are full of
	     Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and
	     Jake knocked him clear outa the
	     ring in Detroit. He's the only guy
	     ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa
	     matter with you? I thought we had
	     an arrangement.
	
	               REPORTER
	     We do Joey. You know we do.
	
	               JOEY
	     You holding me up for more cash or
	     what?
	
	The bell sounds, ending the sparring round.
	
	               REPORTER
	     I can't print nothing if Jake won't
	     give me nothing.
	
	JOEY walks over to the ring. The REPORTER follows not far
	behind.
	
	               JOEY
	     C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look
	     stupid. I brought these guys up
	     here, now you don't wanna talk to
	     them? What are ya doin'? Open your
	     mouth, for Christsake.
	
	JAKE nods his head, steps out of the ring, and goes directly
	over to the REPORTER, who is about to say: "Hi, Jake."
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     I'm tallin' you now, when I read
	     this, it better not make me look
	     bad.
	
	               REPORTER
	     Jake, did I ever make you look bad
	     before?
	
	               JAKE
	     Maybe it wasn't you, but you know
	     what I'm talkin' about.
	
	               JOEY
	          (interrupting)
	     Don't worry. Don't worry. It's
	     gonna be all right.
	          (to reporter)
	     Ask him your questions.
	
	               REPORTER
	     All right, Jake, you're being
	     talked about as the top
	     middleweight contender. Do you
	     think another victory over Sugar
	     Ray will get you a shot at the
	     title?
	
	               JAKE
	     Why not? There's nobody else around
	     who wants to fight me; they're all
	     afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't
	     have a shot at the title right now.
	
	               REPORTER
	     Well, the word is to get a title
	     shot you have to cooperate with the
	     people who control boxing, in New
	     York. And they're saying that you
	     don't cooperate.
	
	               JAKE
	     You guys know more about that than
	     I do. I just fight...
	
	               JOEY
	          (interrupting)
	     He fights the toughest guys around
	     that everybody else is afraid to
	     fight...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar
	     Ray, and I still don't have a shot
	     at the title.
	
	               REPORTER
	     You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks
	     ago and you're training like this
	     right now... Are you afraid Sugar
	     Ray might beat you this time?
	
	               JAKE
	     I tell you what. You hit me here.
	          (points to his right
	          cheek)
	     Sugar Ray hits me here.
	          (points to his left cheek)
	     I can't tell the difference. I just
	     fight.
	
	JAKE turns to VICKIE, smiles, and prepares for his next
	SPARRING PARTNER.
	
	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB. 1943)
	
	JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the
	bed examining his muscle tone.
	
	He studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his
	wrists. Clenches. Unclenches.
	
	VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and
	panties.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Are you sure we should be doing
	     this?
	
	               JAKE
	     Come over here.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You said never to touch you before
	     a fight.
	
	               JAKE
	          (lovingly)
	     If you let me do it, I'll murder
	     you. Come here.
	
	               VICKIE
	     You said I couldn't. You've been
	     good for two weeks...
	
	               JAKE
	     Come here.
	
	JAKE watches VICKIE approach him. He respects her as he would
	a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.
	
	His round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised
	knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.
	
	She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised
	face.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Take off my pants.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake...
	
	               JAKE
	     Do what I say.
	
	He touches her breasts as she removes his trousers.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Now take the rest off.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake, you made me promise not to
	     get you excited.
	
	               JAKE
	     Go 'head. Do it.
	
	She pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She
	kisses his chest and licks it.
	
	               VICKIE
	     I like the gym smell.
	
	               JAKE
	     Now take your panties off.
	
	She does.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	     Now, touch me...
	          (takes her hand)
	     ... here.
	
	               VICKIE
	     Oh, Jake.
	
	She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his
	erection.
	
	JAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on
	VICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold
	water.
	
	VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold
	water. She is shocked and surprised.
	
	               JAKE
	     I can't do it. I can't fool around.
	     This Robinson, I gotta beat him
	     again. I can't fool around. Don't
	     come near me.
	
	JAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly,
	he turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again,
	and he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes
	the door.
	
	INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 26, 1943)
	
	This is JAKE's rematch with SUGAR RAY (their 3rd fight). AN
	ANNOUNCER's VOICE gives a blow by blow description.
	
	THE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY
	knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and
	lefts. JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays
	in there.
	
	THE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY
	into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin.
	SUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however,
	the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY;
	instead, he comes back and outboxes JAKE.
	
	TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision: SUGAR RAY is
	the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for
	so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the
	fighters in the next bout.
	
	INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	JOEY and TONY are in the dressing room. JAKE sits on the
	table, dejected. His hand is being examined by a DOCTOR. TWO
	HANGERS-ON are also present.
	
	               JOEY
	          (angry)
	     They robbed us! Those fuckin'
	     judges -- What the fuck fight were
	     they watching? If I see them on the
	     street, I'll break their heads.
	     Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!
	     Those judges give him the decision
	     'cause he's goin in the army next
	     week! How else could this have
	     happened?... What do you think they
	     gave him the decision for, that's
	     why.
	
	               JAKE
	          (almost to himself)
	     Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked
	     him down. What did I do wrong? I
	     don't understand.
	
	               JOEY
	     You won and was robbed! You didn't
	     do nothin' wrong.
	
	               JAKE
	     I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to
	     win. I've done a lot of bad things.
	     I dunno...
	
	TONY goes to the door.
	
	               JOYE
	     Fuck that. This was the fight. This
	     coulda done it. This was our shot.
	     They out and out robbed us.
	
	MARIO comes back from the door.
	
	               MARIO
	     Vickie is here, Jake.
	
	               JAKE
	     I don't wanna see nobody.
	
	               JOEY
	     You want us to wait for you?
	
	               JAKE
	     No, take her home. I wanna be alone
	     for a while. Everybody go.
	
	They exit.
	
	                                   DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT. BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM
	
	JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the
	bathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly
	acquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.
	
	We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This
	song carries over onto the following MONTAGE.
	
	MONTAGE
	
	This MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947.
	It shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he
	can. Each of the fights will be introduced by the
	corresponding title card from the "Big Fights" film showing a
	boxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the
	fights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be
	black and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to
	simulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about
	to land a punch on an OPPONENT.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	Still #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's
	face, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects
	accompany these stills.
	
	The fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home
	movies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black
	and white).
	
	It'll go something like this:
	
	A) JAKE VS. FRITZIE ZIVIC at the Detroit Olympia (January 14,
	1944)
	
	B) JAKE, VICKIE, and JOEY, wearing sunglasses, pose in front
	of a Cadillac. (1944)
	
	C) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Madison Square Garden
	(February 23, 1945)
	
	D) JAKE and VICKIE getting married. (This will be a black and
	white still photo, posed especially for the occasion.) (1945,
	
	New Jersey courthouse)
	
	E) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Comiskey Park, Chicago
	(September 26, 1945)
	
	F) JAKE and VICKIE on vacation -- very loving. They are
	dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool. Then,
	JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside. She opens the
	box and takes out a white garment and turban. She kisses
	JAKE.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	VICKIE dressed in the outfit. She looks very much like Lana
	Turner in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." She kisses JAKE.
	(1946)
	
	G) JAKE VS. JIMMY EDGAR at Detroit (The University of Detroit
	Stadium) (June 12, 1946)
	
	H) JOEY's marriage. JAKE and VICKIE are there as witnesses.
	(Could also be a still photo as D was.) (1946)
	
	I) JAKE VS. BOB SATTERFIELD at Wrigley Field, Chicago
	(September 12, 1946)
	
	J) JAKE and VICKIE in front of their new Pelham Parkway
	house. It is an affluent, split-level house, an idyllic scene
	-- stone terrace, freshly cut lawn, etc. JAKE carries VICKIE
	inside.
	
	                                   CUT TO:
	
	JAKE and VICKIE with their two boys JACK, age 2, and JOEY,
	age 1 in the backyard of the Pelham Parkway house; they are
	having a cookout. JOEY and his WIFE and their two children (a
	BOY and a GIRL about the same ages as JAKE's) are there also.
	(1947)
	
	K) JAKE VS. TOMMY BELL at Madison Square Garden (March 14,
	1947)
	
	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE (1947)
	
	WE SEE an early model, round screen television. Nearby an old
	radio. On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the
	preceding montage.
	
	JAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE
	JAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.
	
	JOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is
	near the television. There are some remnants of a snack on
	the table. JAKE's TWO BOYS are playing nearby.
	
	               JAKE
	          (to Joey as he turns down
	          the radio)
	     I just weighed myself - I'm 161. No
	     more deals like this Janiro
	     bullshit. I didn't tell you to do
	     it in the first place.
	
	               JOEY
	     Jake, you're the one who said you
	     could get down to 155! What did I
	     do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
	
	               JAKE
	          (angry)
	     Well, sometimes you shouldn't
	     listen to me! Now I don't know if I
	     can make it down to 155. I'm having
	     trouble making 160, and without
	     telling me, you sign me for a fight
	     at 155 pounds, and if I don't make
	     155, I forfeit $15,000! You're
	     supposed to know what you're doin'.
	     You're supposed to be a manager!
	
	               JOEY
	     You want the title shot?
	
	               JAKE
	     Say what you're gonna say.
	
	               JOEY
	     You want the title shot or not?
	
	               JAKE
	     Say what you gotta say. Don't be a
	     smart ass.
	
	               JOEY
	          (yelling)
	     This Janiro's an up-and-coming
	     fighter, this kid you gotta knock
	     out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm
	     telling you, this is your step
	     towards getting a shot at the
	     title. Listen to me: I'm telling
	     you. You been killin' yourself for
	     three years. There's nobody left --
	     they're afraid to fight you.
	     This Janiro's up-and-coming. He
	     don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,
	     wipe him out! What are you worried
	     about? Your weight? Look, even if
	     you lose they're gonna think you're
	     weak; they're gonna think you're
	     not the fighter you used to be.
	     They'll match you with guys they
	     were afraid to match you with
	     before, and then you'll kill them
	     and you'll get your title shot. And
	     if you beat this kid Janiro, they
	     gotta give you a shot at the title
	     because there's nobody else. Either
	     way you win and you do it on your
	     own -- just like you want it. All
	     right?
	
	               VICKIE
	     Joey's right. Janiro's up-and
	     coming, he's good looking...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     What do you mean, "good looking?"
	
	               VICKIE
	     Well, he's popular. A lotta people
	     like Janiro. You beat him and it
	     only figures they'll wanna see you
	     get a title shot. But, what do I
	     know? I should keep my mouth shut,
	     I should...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
	
	               VICKIE
	     But, Jake, I was just...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
	
	               VICKIE
	     I was just...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
	
	VICKIE, amazed, gets up to leave.
	
	JAKE glares at her.
	
	VICKIE rounds up the kids and takes them into the kitchen.
	(MOVING SHOT).
	
	WE SEE VICKIE in the kitchen angrily throwing things around.
	We clearly see the tension as she cleans up, muttering to
	herself.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	          (turns to Joey)
	     All right, manager. Everybody had
	     their say around here. Now this is
	     what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna get
	     down to 155, and I'm gonna destroy
	     this kid -- get my title shot. And
	     don't ever bet 15 thousand without
	     my sayso again.
	
	JAKE comes into the kitchen. He tries to make up with VICKIE.
	She plays hard-to-get. They begin to tease each other.
	
	INT. COPACABANA LOUNGE - NIGHT (1947)
	
	A COMEDIAN is in the middle of his act. JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY,
	and JANET sit at a nearby table. JANET, an attractive blonde,
	is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her,
	you know this is not his wife.
	
	The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his
	routine to point out that JAKE LAMOTTA is in the audience,
	and even tries a little harmless joking at JAKE's expense.
	
	               COMEDIAN
	     Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
	     point out a special guest we have
	     with us tonight -- The Raging Bull,
	     The Bronx Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.
	
	There is applause. JAKE smiles, and gives a hesitant wave.
	
	               COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
	     Stand up, Jake, c'mon. Oh, you are
	     standing. Sorry.
	          (laughs)
	     Just kiddin', Jake.
	
	JAKE waves a fist at the COMEDIAN, good-naturedly playing
	along with the joke -- even though he hates it.
	
	               JAKE
	          (to Joey)
	     Look at this abuse I gotta take.
	
	JOEY, VICKIE, and JANET are amused.
	
	               JAKE (CONT'D)
	          (joking)
	     What's so funny?
	          (lifting his glass)
	     Cheers! Post-time. Joey, Vickie,
	     and...
	          (to Janet)
	     What's your name again, darling?
	
	               JANET
	     Janet.
	
	JAKE Smiles. They all drink.
	
	SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed
	even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.),
	comes over to their table. He walks around like he owns the
	fucking place. JAKE hates it.
	
	               SALVY
	     Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'?
	     Vickie...
	
	They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.
	
	SALVY goes on his way to COMO's table.
	
	As SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE.
	
	               JAKE
	     What're you lookin' at? You lookin'
	     at him?
	
	               VICKIE
	     No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
	
	               JAKE
	     Don't tell me "No." I saw you
	     lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
	
	               VICKIE
	     I'm not interested in him.
	
	               JAKE
	     You're not interested in him?
	
	               VICKIE
	     No, I'm not.
	
	               JAKE
	     In other words, you're not
	     interested in him but you'd be
	     interested in somebody else, right?
	
	               VICKIE
	     Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
	
	               JAKE
	          (turns to Joey, referring
	          to Salvy)
	     Look at this, all of a sudden
	     everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around
	     here. Did you see the way she was
	     lookin' at him?
	
	               JOEY
	     Nah, she would never...
	
	               JAKE
	          (interrupting)
	     Didn't you just see her lookin' at
	      him? She told me no, but I don't
	      believe her.
	
	                JOEY
	           (uncomfortable)
	      C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy
	      about you.
	
	JAKE gives him a suspicious look. JOEY feels uneasy.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'd just love to catch her. Oooooh,
	      I'd just love to catch her once.
	
	Drinks arrive at their table.
	
	                WAITER
	      These are from Tommy Como.
	
	JAKE looks up but can't see where COMO is. JOEY gets up.
	
	                JOEY
	           (to Jake)
	      Excuse me for a minute. Be right
	      back.
	
	                JAKE
	           (sarcastic)
	      Don't be long. I'm afraid with all
	      these tough guys here.
	
	JOEY goes to COMO's table in the rear of the lounge. JAKE
	slides over and watches. JOEY shakes hands with COMO. SALVY
	is there at COMO's table. JOEY comes right back.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jake, come over for a few minutes.
	      Tommy wants to say hello to you.
	      C'mon, just come and say hello.
	
	JAKE doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway.
	
	ANOTHER ANGLE: COMO's table. JAKE comes over.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hi, Tommy. How are you?
	
	                TOMMY
	      Jake, sit down for a minute.
	
	JAKE sits. SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE. JAKE barely nods
	back.
	
	                TOMMY (CONT'D)
	           (his arm around Jake)
	      Fuckin' kid! You're the best
	      fuckin' fighter around. Loved what
	      you did to Satterfield. Them
	      "moulan yans" -- forget about it.
	      They're all afraid to fight you.
	
	                JAKE
	           (a little embarrassed)
	      C'mon, Tommy --
	
	                TOMMY
	      How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin'
	      good?
	
	                JAKE
	      Never felt better.
	
	                TOMMY
	      Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
	
	                JAKE
	      He should.
	
	                TOMMY
	           (to Salvy)
	      This Janiro's a good fiahter,
	      pretty good-lookin' kid.
	
	                SALVY
	      Bet on him three times. Always come
	      through for me.
	
	JAKE just stares, holding his anger in.
	
	There is a pause.
	
	                TOMMY
	      How's the weight? Ok?
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah, the weight's Ok.
	
	Another pause. TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.
	
	                TOMMY
	      All right, lemme ask you something.
	      Let's say I was a good friend of
	      yours. And I was telling you I was
	      gonna bet a lot of money on you in
	      this Janiro fight. What would you
	      tell me?
	
	                JAKE
	      I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
	
	TOMMY sips his drink.
	
	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	VICKIE is in bed trying to sleep. JAKE comes out of the
	bathroom half-dressed, and sits on the edge of the bed
	(preoccupied). Silence.
	
	                JAKE
	      Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
	
	                VICKIE
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      You asleep?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Yeah.
	
	                JAKE
	      Huh?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Yeah, what?
	
	                JAKE
	      Tell me, you think of anybody else
	      when I'm making love to you?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Nobody. I love you, remember?
	
	                JAKE
	      Then why'd you say that thing about
	      Tony Janiro?
	
	                VICKIE
	      What did I say?
	
	                JAKE
	      That he's got a pretty face.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I never noticed his face.
	
	                JAKE
	      You sure you're not thinking of him
	      right now?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Positive.
	
	                JAKE
	      You're the one who said he was good
	      looking. You think he's good
	      looking 'cause I know you think
	      he's good-looking. I'll smash his
	      face inside out. I'll make him into
	      dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's
	      good-looking when I get through
	      with him. So you just go ahead and
	      think about who you want.
	
	VICKIE freezes.
	
	INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY
	
	TONY JANIRO, wearing boxer trunks, steps off the scale.
	Commissioner COL. EDDIE EAGAN, a white-haired, heavyset man
	in his mid-forties, calls out the weight.
	
	The basement of the New York Boxing Commission on Worth
	Street is a sparse room, crowded with REPORTERS, TRAINERS and
	MANAGERS.
	
	                EAGAN
	      Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half.
	
	JAKE steps on the scale. He looks weak and woozy. After the
	customary adjustments, EAGAN calls out:
	
	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
	      Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one
	      fourth.
	
	There's a commotion in JAKE's camp. JANIRO smiles.
	
	                JAKE
	      Just a minute.
	
	JAKE, JOEY, and TONY confer.
	
	JAKE gets off the scale and enters the men's room. An
	OFFICIAL follows him.
	
	INT. THE MEN'S ROOM
	
	JAKE forces himself to urinate.
	
	INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT
	
	JAKE comes out of the bathroom, and gets back on the scale.
	
	                EAGAN
	      Ok. This is official.
	
	LAMOTTA stares at JANIRO.
	
	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
	      LaMotta, 155 lbs. on the nose.
	
	JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss.
	
	INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
	
	It's the last round and JAKE is pouring it on a beaten and
	virtually helpless JANIRO.
	
	The CROWD chants:
	
	                CROWD
	      LaMotta.
	
	HALF THE AUDIENCE is already on its feet. The kill is
	imminent -- and they love it.
	
	JAKE lands one blow after another. He is relentless.
	
	Several rows back, TOMMY COMO, SALVY and SEVERAL OTHER "MADE"
	GUYS sit with sober looks on their faces.
	
	JAKE moves in fast, and with a powerful barrage, smashes
	JANIRO's nose -- plastering it against his left cheek.
	
	The final bell rings. JANIRO, his legs all rubber, staggers
	back to his corner.
	
	JAKE prances about, kissing his fists and throwing them to
	the CROWD. JOEY rushes out, throws JAKE's leopard skin robe
	over him and embraces him. TONY follows. JAKE looks right at
	COMO and SALVY.
	
	AN ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring:
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      The winner, by unanimous decision,
	      in ten rounds, Jake LaMotta!
	
	                JOEY
	      I love you.
	
	JAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight,
	still manages to prance around the ring victoriously.
	
	VICKIE, now near the ring, throws kisses to JAKE.
	
	                JAKE
	           (shouts to Vickie)
	      This is my night! Listen to them!
	      I'm gonna be champ!
	
	He bends down and gives her a kiss through the ropes.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      I'm making everything up to you.
	
	INT. COPACABANA - NIGHT (1947)
	
	JOEY is at the bar with a DETROIT PROMOTER and JACKIE CURTIE.

	      When we gonna get Jake back in
	      Detroit? Jesus, he really did a job
	      on Janiro. Who you after next,
	      Joey?
	
	                JOEY
	           (evasive)
	      I dunno. We're working on it. He's
	      training at the camp now.
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      After what I seen, they gotta give
	      him a shot at the title.
	
	                JOEY
	      We're gonna get our shot.
	
	The DETROIT PROMOTER introduces JOEY to JACKIE CURTIE.
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Oh Joey, this is Jackie Curtie. He
	      handles a lot of business in South
	      Ohio.
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      I like your brother. Made a lot of
	      money on him.
	
	                JOEY
	      Betcha more than he has.
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      Made a little cabbage on the Tommy
	      Bell fight too. Whatever happened
	      to him?
	
	                JOEY
	      Ain't he dead?
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Nah. He's got a job downtown. Runs
	      an elevator in some building.
	
	                JOEY
	      Yeah?
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Went down to see him the other day.
	      I says, "Tommy, take me up to the
	      fifth floor." And you know, he took
	      me right up there. 
	
	                JACKIE CURTIE
	      Yeah, Tommy always was a stand-up
	      guy.
	
	SALVY and PATSY arrive with VERA, SANDY (two neighborhood
	girls), and VICKIE. They go to a nearby table.
	
	The bar area: JOEY sees this.
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      Joey, let me get you another drink.
	
	                JOEY
	           (distracted)
	      Just a minute. Excuse me. I'll be
	      right back.
	
	The table area: JOEY arrives at SALVY's table. VICKIE is
	nervous. There is a cold exchange of'"hellos."
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	           (to Vickie)
	      C'mere, let me talk to you for a
	      minute.
	
	There is an awkward silence as he grabs VICKIE by the arm and
	takes her over to the hat-check area.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      What're you doin' with Salvy? You
	      shouldn't be here with him. Jake's
	      away killin' himself. Suppose he
	      found out.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What the hell am I doing wrong?
	      Just because Jake is training, I
	      can't go out? What am I, a goddamn
	      prisoner?
	
	                JOEY
	      No, you're his wife.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I'm not doing anythina wrong. I'm
	      just trying to have a good time. Do
	      I have to be cooped up in the house
	      all the time?
	
	                JOEY
	      It don't look right.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's
	      gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter
	      of time.
	
	                JOEY
	      I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but
	      if he finds out, he will kill you.
	      What's the matter with you? Aren't
	      you happy? You got everything you
	      want.
	
	                VICKIE
	      You don't sleep with him. I do. I
	      don't get to breathe without
	      tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage.
	      If he thinks I'm lookin' at
	      somebody the wrong way, I get used
	      as a punching bag. He don't trust
	      nobody. If he saw the two of us
	      talking together right now, you'd
	      be in trouble too -- believe me.
	      Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old.
	      I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake,
	      but you don't know. He gets crazy
	      sometimes. I'm scared.
	
	                JOEY
	      Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's
	      got a lotta aggravation. He's been
	      a top contender too long.
	
	                VICKIE
	      That's right, take his part. You're
	      his brother. He's never gonna be
	      champ. Too many people are against
	      him.
	
	                JOEY
	      And you're drinking with them right
	      now.
	
	                VICKIE
	      And I'm gonna finish my drink. And,
	      I'm gonna have a good time, because
	      I ain't doing nothing wrong.
	
	She starts to go back to the table.
	
	                JOEY
	           (grabbing her)
	      You're wrong to be here. Let's go.
	
	VICKIE pulls away from JOEY, and goes back to the table.
	
	The table area: JOEY arrives at the table. He grabs VICKIE.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      I said, let's go.
	
	                SALVY
	      Joey, relax. You're taking this the
	      wrong way. Why don't you sit down
	      and have a drink?
	
	                JOEY
	      Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister
	      in-law.
	
	                SALVY
	      Excuse me for living.
	
	                JOEY
	      What do you think, I'm blind? My
	      brother's breaking his ass in a
	      ring, and you're here with his
	      wife.
	
	                SALVY
	      Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and
	      Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just
	      happened to come along. We're just
	      trying to have a good time. What do
	      you want from me? So, why don't you
	      just take it easy before this gets
	      out of hand.
	
	As the conversation gets louder, PEOPLE begin to notice.
	PAUL, the owner (a tough-looking, well-dressed guy), and some
	BOUNCERS also become aware of the argument.
	
	                JOEY
	      Get the fuck outa here. What did
	      you do, take your gangster pills
	      today? I'll tear your fuckin' head
	      off your shoulders!
	
	JOEY goes for SALVY. PEOPLE react.
	
	The GIRLS begin to scream. VICKIE exits. JOEY notices her
	leave, and calls after her.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Hey, wait --
	
	PAUL comes over and stops the fight.
	
	                PAUL
	      Ain't you forgettin' something?
	      Ain't there never supposed to be no
	      trouble in this joint?
	
	SALVY and JOEY give each other looks. JOEY goes out after
	VICKIE.
	
	EXT. COPACABANA - NIGHT
	
	JOEY looks up the street for VICKIE. She is gone.
	
	SALVY and PATSY come out of the entrance.
	
	                SALVY
	      Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die
	      young?
	
	                JOEY
	           (as he turns and lashes
	           into Salvy and Patsy)
	      I'll suck your eyes out! I'll
	      fuckin' take the two of you.
	
	After a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come
	out. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY
	and JOEY, but can't.
	
	JOEY savagely beats SALVY on the Copa steps and in the street
	against the parked cars.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Fuckin' low-life, cocksucker, etc.
	      ...
	
	SALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him.
	SALVY hits the pavement. JOEY kicks him.
	
	PAUL, PATSY, and the BOUNCERS finally pull JOEY away. PATSY
	tries to go after JOEY again, but PAUL stops him.
	
	                PATSY
	           (to Paul)
	      Don't fuckin' put your hands on me!
	      You're gonna near about this, Paul.
	
	                PAUL
	           (to Patsy)
	      Get the fuck outa here. Don't come
	      in my place and start fuckin'
	      trouble -- I don't care who you
	      are!
	           (to Joey)
	      Get outa here. Go on.
	
	JOEY looks back at him, and then walks away.
	
	INT. THE BACK ROOM OF THE DEBONAIR SOCIAL CLUB
	
	The room is furnished with a few round tables and some
	chairs; it is somewhat reminiscent of an old-fashioned candy
	store.
	
	TOMMY COMO, SALVY, PATSY and JOEY are present. SALVY's face
	is bruised from the beating JOEY gave him.
	
	                COMO
	      All rightg I don't have to hear any
	      more. I think I understand what
	      happened. I understand it was your
	      brother's wife and there was
	      probably a misunderstanding. I'm
	      not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have
	      acted the way he did. But, Joey,
	      you don't raise your hands. You
	      don't do that kind of thing. This
	      time we forget about it but no more
	      after this. You understand?
	
	                JOEY
	      Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
	
	                COMO
	      All right, you guys, shake hands.
	
	SALVY, JOEY, and PATSY shake hands.
	
	                COMO (CONT'D)
	      Go 'head. Be friends. That's it.
	           (to Salvy and Patsy)
	      All right, lemme be alone with him
	      for a minute.
	
	SALVY and PATSY exit.
	
	There is a pause.
	
	                COMO (CONT'D)
	      Aside from everything else, your
	      family all right?
	
	                JOEY
	      Yeah, they're good. They're good,
	      Tommy.
	
	                COMO
	      What is it with you? Can't you
	      talk? You got like a funny
	      attitude. I can't figure you out,
	      Joey. What's with you and the quick
	      answers? You wanna get outa here
	      fast?
	
	                JOEY
	      Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
	
	                COMO
	      Look Joey, I wanna tell you
	      something.
	      Your brother ain't gonna get
	      nowhere without us -- nowhere. And
	      I'm tellin' you between the two of
	      us, it's gettin' to the point where
	      it's gettin' to be a real
	      embarrassment to me, a real
	      embarrassment.
	
	                JOEY
	      How can he embarrass you?
	
	                COMO
	      He's an embarrassment because
	      Frankie and the other guys are
	      expectin' me to do something about
	      it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I
	      can't deliver a kid from my own
	      neighborhood. Why's he make it so
	      hard on himself? He comes to me, I
	      can make it easier for him.
	
	                JOEY
	      Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't
	      even say hello to anybody else --
	      you know that. But you know when
	      Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus
	      Christ Almighty could get off the
	      fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna
	      talk him out of it. I'm his kid
	      brother. I got no say with Jake on
	      this. He thinks he can buck
	      everybody and make it on his own.
	
	                COMO
	      Make it on his own? Does he know
	      the kind of money involved? I mean
	      the real money. He thinks he's
	      gonna become champ on his own?
	      We're gonna sit by and see some nut
	      come in there and hold one of the
	      most important titles in the world?
	      A nut who don't listen to nobody or
	      respect nobody? Is he really crazy?
	      Listen, Joey, you understand, you
	      tell him. I don't care how great he
	      is or how colorful. He could beat
	      all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all
	      the Janiros he wants to. He ain't
	      gonna get a shot at the title
	      without us. I'm not askin' you to
	      do another thing except get that
	      message into that thick head!
	
	EXT. SHORERAVEN POOL - DAY
	
	Another day. JOEY, fully clothed, opens the gate and looks
	around.
	
	JAKE is sitting alone near the deep end. JOEY walks over to
	him.
	
	                JOEY
	      Whatcha doin'?
	
	                JAKE
	      I remember the first time I met
	      Vickie... I know there's somethin'
	      up. I know she's doin' somethin',
	      but I can't catch her...
	
	                JOEY
	      Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit
	      her so she can't talk to you the
	      way she wants to.
	
	                JAKE
	      What do you mean?
	
	                JOEY
	      Try talkin' to her. She's your wife
	      -- ask her what's the matter.
	
	                JAKE
	      When I'm away, did you ever notice
	      anythin' funny with her? Tell me
	      the truth.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jack, if there was anything funny,
	      I would tell you.
	
	                JAKE
	      I want you to keep an eye on her
	      when I'm not here. Understand?
	
	                JOEY
	      Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
	
	                JAKE
	      What did Tommy say?
	
	                JOEY
	      I got good news, and I got bad
	      news. The good news is you got your
	      shot at the title. The bad news
	      is...
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting, resigned)
	      Yeah, I know.
	
	INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY
	
	As BILLY FOX steps off the scales, EDDIE EAGAN calls out:
	
	                EAGAN
	      Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds.
	
	JOEY removes JAKE's leopard-skin robe as he steps on the
	scale. The REPORTERS crowd around.
	
	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
	      Jake LaMotta, 167 pounds.
	
	JAKE'S HANDLERS urge him with words of encouragement as they
	walk toward his dressing room.
	
	INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
	
	EAGAN walks over.
	
	                JAKE
	      What's up, Colonel?
	
	                EAGAN
	      I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
	
	                JOEY
	      Sure.
	
	                EAGAN
	      I suppose you heard what
	      everybody's been saying, Jake.
	
	                JAKE
	      What who's been sayin'?
	
	                EAGAN
	      You were a big favorite in this
	      fight. Then two days ago the odds
	      start jumping all over the place
	      until you're a 12-5 underdog.
	
	                JAKE
	      I don't follow no gamblin'
	      Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
	
	                EAGAN
	      Now the fight's off the books
	      altogether.
	      Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet
	      down on this fight. Some people are
	      saying you're going into the tank.
	
	                JAKE
	      Believe what you want.
	
	                EAGAN
	      I want to believe you, LaMotta.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin'
	      jig's gonna wish he never came outa
	      the jungle. You got any money?
	
	                EACAN
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      You got any money you want to bet
	      on Billy Fox, you can put it right
	      here...
	           (extends his hand)
	      'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down
	      for nobody.
	
	EAGAN taps JAKE on the shoulder.
	
	                EAGAN
	      That's all I wanted to hear.
	
	JAKE glares at EAGAN as the COMMISSIONER walks away.
	
	INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT (NOV. 14, 1947)
	
	The old Garden is packed. The EX-CHAMPS, the PRESS, the
	OFFICIALS, the MOB GUYS, the FANS -- they're all here.
	
	The FIGHTERS are announced. BILLY FOX and JAKE touch gloves
	and return to their corners.
	
	FOX is taller and has a longer reach than JAKE.
	
	The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS come out. FOX goes to the
	head; JAKE goes to the body.
	
	FOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.
	FOX is surprised. In the past, his opponents have gone down
	when he connected.
	
	In the audience, COMO, SALVY, and some other BOYS watch with
	interest.
	
	JAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows.
	All of a sudden, FOX is wobbly. JAKE goes for the head, then
	cuts his punch short. FOX is about to go down.
	
	JAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesn't fall.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Fox)
	      Stand up! What the fuck are you
	      doin'?
	
	The REFEREE breaks them apart and FOX remounts his attack.
	JAKE bicycles into a corner and lets FOX work him over.
	
	FOX connects: once, twice, three times. JAKE barely defends
	himself -- but he doesn't go down either.
	
	The CROWD starts to smell a fix. There are calls from the
	AUDIENCE.
	
	                CROWD
	      Got your swimming trunks on, Jake?
	      I hope they're paying you enough.
	      Fake, fake.
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	JAKE's corner. JAKE is acting stunned. TONY, not aware of
	what's going on, is slapping JAKE.
	
	                TONY
	      What's the matter with you? What's
	      the matter with you?
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	The sign reads "Round Four." JAKE is in the center of the
	ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX. JAKE's arms hang
	at waist level... FOX lands one blow after another. The stink
	of a fix permeates the arena.
	
	JAKE is furious that FOX can't deck him. He curses through
	his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):
	
	                JAKE
	      Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter
	      with you, you motherfucker? Hit me!
	
	Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden. This is not even a
	fight. The REFEREE, realizing this, steps in between FOX and
	LAMOTTA, waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by
	a technical knockout.
	
	As he does, JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and
	struts back to his corner.
	
	JAKE, JOEY, and TONY are already on their way out of the
	arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner.
	
	COMO and the OTHERS, satisfied, get up to leave.
	
	INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
	
	As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door, WE
	SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. They rush
	in, look, and stop by the door. There is silence -- except
	for JAKE'S uncontrollable sobbing. The atmosphere is like
	that of funeral.
	
	JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table. He is still in his
	leopard-skin robe. His head hangs low as he sobs.
	
	The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. The HANDLER motions to him
	to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. The REPORTER
	still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the
	scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to
	scribble away on his pad.
	
	JOEY, standing near JAKE, has his back to everyone; his
	shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. He cries
	soundlessly. TONY is pacing nearby.
	
	                TONY
	      Don't fight anymore!
	           (pause)
	      It's a free country, don't fight
	      anymore!
	
	                JAKE
	           (between sobs)
	      Why did they have to stop it? Why
	      did they have to stop it?
	
	The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers.
	
	                REPORTER
	      What happened?
	
	                HANDLER
	           (quietly)
	      He must've been really hurt in the
	      2nd. He didn't answer me when I
	      tried to tell him something in the
	      corner.
	
	JAKE, still buried in his robe, becomes aware of the hum of
	voices and shouts out:
	
	                JAKE
	      Get everyone out of here!
	
	The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave. JAKE continues to
	sob.
	
	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	INSERT: CLOSE UP of a Daily News Headline from November 22,
	1947: "Board Suspends LaMotta."
	
	JAKE, dejected, sits on the couch. In front of him, on the
	coffee table are scattered several newspapers -- including
	the one with the headline we have just seen.
	
	JOEY paces in front of JAKE.
	
	                JOEY
	           (yelling)
	      It woulda been so easy, Jack. So
	      easy...
	
	JOEY goes into a boxing stance.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Stick out your hands, Jake.
	
	                JAKE
	      C'mon, Joey.
	
	                JOEY
	      G'wan, do it.
	           (jabs at him)
	      Protect yourself, rummy.
	
	JAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY
	feigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- "out cold." JAKE
	looks down at him.
	
	JOEY pops to his feet.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      See? That's all there was to it.
	
	                JAKE
	      What the fuck they want? I took the
	      dive. They want me to fall down
	      too? I don't fall down for nobody.
	      I never went down in my life. Joey,
	      what do I gotta do?
	      Crawl on my hands and knees? I made
	      an asshole of myself in the fuckin'
	      Garden! All the newspaper writers
	      make fun of me. I'm the bum of the
	      year. All I want is a shot. Just a
	      fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do?
	      I'll do anything.
	
	                JOEY
	      Except fall down like a normal
	      person.
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah, except fall down. That's
	      right.
	
	                JOEY
	      All right, you don't wanna fall
	      down, so now you gotta take a rest.
	      So, you enjoy the suspension.
	      'Cause there's nothin' you can do
	      about it. Let the Commissioner and
	      the D.A. jerk you around. So you
	      wait.
	
	                JAKE
	      Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am
	      I gonna do for seven months? I'm
	      gonna go crazy. How do I keep my
	      strength? By that time I'll be too
	      weak to win the title. And my
	      weight? Forget about it -- I'm
	      gonna blow up like a balloon. I
	      ain't never gonna hold my weight
	      down. Seven months! I don't know...
	
	                JOEY
	      We did what we had to do. Tommy
	      don't forget. Sooner or later
	      you'll get your shot -- if Tommy
	      don't die.
	
	EXT. BOOK-CADILLAC HOTEL, DETROIT - DAY (1949)
	
	It's raining outside the stately Book-Cadillac.
	
	A banner above the door proclaims.
	              The Book-Cadillac Welcomes
	                    Marcel Cerdan
	          Middleweight Champion of the World
	                  and the Challenger
	                     Jake LaMotta
	
	INT. BOOK-CADILLAC LOBBY - DAY
	
	The lobby is chaotic: FIGHT PEOPLE and SPORTSWRITERS mill
	anxiously about. Something's in the air.
	
	The BELL CAPTAIN pages:
	
	                BELL CAPTAIN
	      Mr. Williams.
	
	MR. WILLIAMS, THE DETROIT PROMOTER last seen in the
	Copacabana Lounge, answers the page.
	
	WILLIAMS listens on the phone a moment, then hands it back to
	the BELL CAPTAIN and announces:
	
	                DETROIT PROMOTER
	      It's official. The fight's been
	      postponed twenty-four hours.
	
	A groan goes up from the lobby.
	
	INT. LAMOTTA'S SUITE - DAY
	
	JAKE's suite is modestly decorated and consists of a living
	room and two bedrooms.
	
	DR. PINTO is there sewing up a pork chop.
	
	JAKE, shadow-boxing in sportswear, paces back and forth.
	
	TONY watches him. VICKIE sits quietly on the sofa, sipping
	some wine.
	
	JOEY is on the phone.
	
	                JOEY
	      That's right. "No comment."
	           (listens)
	      You like that? Good, 'cause I got a
	      lot more "No comments" where that
	      one came from.
	
	JOEY cuts the line off, then leaves the receiver off the
	hook.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have
	      a steak.
	
	                JAKE
	      I can't eat a steak. If I eat a
	      steak, I'm gonna have trouble
	      making the weigh-in.
	
	                JOEY
	      So eat just a little. You gotta eat
	      something.
	
	                JARS
	      What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I
	      can't even eat!
	
	JAKE goes into the bedroom.
	
	JOEY goes over to the DOCTOR.
	
	                DOCTOR
	           (shows him the pork chop)
	      How's that?
	
	                JOEY
	      How long did it take you?
	
	                DOCTOR
	      45 seconds.
	
	                JOEY
	      No good. Try to get it down. It's
	      gotta be no more than 30 seconds to
	      be on the safe side if we gotta
	      stitch him up.
	
	INT. THE BEDROOM
	
	JAKE is alone. There is a knock at the door. JOEY opens it
	and pokes his head in.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jake, somebody wants to say hello
	      to you.
	
	JOEY opens the door wider. TOMMY COMO is at the door with
	JOEY. JAKE goes over to the door.
	
	                COMO
	      Hey champ!
	
	                JAKE
	      Tommy, thanks for coming over.
	
	                COMO
	      You just take it easy, now. You'll
	      do all right. Feelin' Ok?
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm Ok.
	
	                COMO
	      Just come by to wish you luck.
	           (shakes his hand)
	      Need anything?
	
	                JAKE
	      No, we're all right. Thanks anyway,
	      Tommy.
	
	                COMO
	      Ok, champ.
	
	COMO turns to go. He says goodbye to everyone in the living
	room. He goes over and kisses VICKIE. JAKE watches this from
	the bedroom doorway.
	
	                COMO (CONT'D)
	           (as he kisses Vickie)
	      Look at her. As beautiful as
	      always. Take care of that guy, will
	      ya?
	
	                VICKIE
	           (going to the door with
	           him)
	      I'll take care of him. Thanks,
	      Tommy. Bye.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Vickie)
	      C'mere.
	
	She goes to the bedroom doorway. JAKE grabs her arm, pulls
	her in, and slams the door.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	           (pushing her toward the
	           bed area)
	      Hey, you don't say goodbye to him
	      like that.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What did I do?
	
	                JAKE
	           (pushing her)
	      You don't kiss like that. Hello and
	      goodbye, that's all you do.
	
	                VICKIE
	      All I did...
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      You know what I'm talking about.
	      Don't ever make me look bad on the
	      night of my big fight.
	
	                VICKIE
	      You're hurting my arm.
	
	JAKE has her by the night table now. They are edging their
	way to the wall.
	
	                JAKE
	      Shut up. You just say hello and
	      goodbye to him. You don't kiss him
	      the way you did. That's out of
	      line.
	
	JAKE pushes her against the wall. The lamp falls. There is a
	loud crash. She tries to move away. He grabs her by the
	throat and pins her against the wall. She's gagging.
	
	                VICKIE
	      But Jake... I didn't say
	      anything...
	
	                JAKE
	      Don't ever do that again. You don't
	           (he pushes her against the
	           wall)
	      do it!
	
	                VICKIE
	           (gagging)
	      Jake...
	
	JOEY looks in and then starts to come over.
	
	                JAKE
	      You hear what I said? You don't do
	      it.
	
	He pushes her again. VICKIE tries to get away, but can't
	move.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	           (pushing her again)
	      You don't do it.
	
	JOEY has his hand on JAKE's arm, trying to pry it away from
	VICKIE's throat.
	
	                JOEY
	      Jake, Jake...
	
	TONY and the DOCTOR watch from the doorway.
	
	VICKIE's eyes close. JAKE releases his grip. JOEY helps
	VICKIE. JAKE watches this.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to himself)
	      She ain't gonna ruin this fight for
	      me.
	
	EXT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT (JUNE 16, 1949)
	
	Bright floodlights illuminate the arena. The weather's clear
	and the stadium is filled with cheering fight FANS.
	
	An ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring and begins ti
	introduce the many CELEBRITIES that have gathered for the
	fight.
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      And here is the young man who has
	      inherited Marcel Cerdan's European
	      championship - Laurent Dauthuille.
	
	DAUTHUILLE jumps into the ring.
	
	While WE HEAR him introduce the boxers and celebrities, WE
	SEE a rapid MONTAGE: JAKE preparing for the title bout:
	
	PRE-FIGHT MONTAGE
	
	A) JAKE and GROUP arrive in the dressing room.
	
	B) In his bathrobe, JAKE puts on his boxing shoes.
	
	C) We see a pan with raw steak in it. JOEY drains the blood
	(juice) into a glass and JAKE takes a long, slow swallow.
	
	D) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION) - NEW
	ANGLE.
	
	TOMMY COMO shakes JAKE's hand in the bathroom doorway. VICKIE
	kisses COMO. Jake watches.
	
	                ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	      And our very special guest tonight
	      needs no introduction. The only man
	      to defend the heavyweight crown a
	      remarkable twenty-five times, the
	      king of all heavyweights, the Brown
	      Bomber, Joe Louis. Come into the
	      ring, Joe.
	
	                JOE LOUIS (V.O.)
	      Thank you, Johnny. Let's bring the
	      middleweight crown back to the old
	      U.S.A. where it belongs.
	
	Many cheers.
	
	E) DR. PINTO injects a hypodermic needle filled with
	novocaine into each of JAKE's fists.
	
	F) JOEY massages JAKE's neck.
	
	G) JAKE's hands are bandaged
	
	H) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION - NEW
	ANGLE)
	
	JAKE strangles VICKIE in the bedroom, then releases her.
	
	JOEY looks after her, but the IMAGE makes them look as if
	they're making love. Jake watches.
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      And in this corner, the
	      middleweight champion of the world,
	      from Casablanca, Morocco, the
	      Casablanca Clouter, Marcel Cerdan!
	
	I) JAKE puts on his cup and trunks.
	
	J) MARIO laces up JAKE's gloves.
	
	K) JAKE, ready to fight, a towel draped around his head,
	bounces on the balls of his feet. He starts walking down the
	corridor from his dressing room, surrounded by MARIO, JOEY,
	DR. PINTO and his HANDLERS. He enters the stadium.
	
	INT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	JAKE, wearing his leopard-skin robe, is pushed through the
	CROWD by JOEY, MARIO and his HANDLERS. He's still shadow
	boxing.
	
	JAKE steps into the ring to both cheers and boos (many still
	remember the Fox fight). JAKE raises his gloves.
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      And in the opposite corner, from
	      New York, New York, the challenger,
	      the Bronx Bull, Jake LaMotta!
	
	JAKE shakes hands with the assembled CELEBRITIES and EX
	CHAMPIONS.
	
	                JAYE
	      I only wish it was you, Joe.
	
	                JOE LOUIS
	      Win the belt back for us, Jake.
	      Good luck.
	
	JAKE glances at VICKIE who is sitting in the third row. She
	is nervous.
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	The opening bell sounds. CERDAN and LAMOTTA touch gloves and
	begin to fight.
	
	JAKE is hot: there's no stopping him tonight. He fights like
	a man possessed.
	
	CERDAN clinches JAKE to avoid his brutal body blows. JAKE
	pushes him out of the clinch in disgust.
	
	There are no more boos. JAKE has won over the crowd.
	
	                                    TIME CUT:
	
	END OF ROUND NINE. JAKE is working over a bloody CERDAN.
	Punches to the body, then to the head, then back to the body.
	The bell sounds.
	
	JAKE walks back to his corner and sits down. JOEY is
	ecstatic:
	
	                JOEY
	      Look at him, Jackie! You got at!
	      The fuckin' championship! He's
	      yours! Finish him off.
	
	JAKE doesn't have the chance. The REFEREE, standing in
	CERDAN's corner, waves his hands signaling the end of the
	fight.
	
	The REFEREE holds up JAKE's hands as THE ANNOUNCER takes the
	mike:
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      The new middleweight champion of
	      the world by a knockout after nine
	      rounds, the Bronx Bull, Jake
	      LaMotta!
	
	JOEY is all over him. TONY helps VICKIE through the MOB.
	
	In his corner, CERDAN holds his head in his hands and says,
	"My title, my title!"
	
	The OFFICIALS clear a circle as they bring over the jewel
	studded championship belt. JOE LOUIS fastens the belt around
	JAKE's waist.
	
	JAKE touches the oversized belt with his bloody gloves. Tears
	fall across JAKE's huge grin as he holds his hands high in
	the air. It is the most glorious night in his life.
	
	EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)
	
	The name "Jake LaMotta's Lounge" is emblazoned in neon across
	a lounge/liquor store on Collins Avenue, Miami's main drag.
	JAKE's bar is across from The Rooney Plaza, one of Miami's
	more prestigious hotels.
	
	Fifties cars are parked outside the club.
	
	INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT
	
	JAKE LAMOTTA, 34 years old, wearing a tux, steps in front of
	a large painted wall mural of the Cerdan fight as he enters
	his club.
	
	The Lounge is dominated by a large circular bar. Featured
	entertainers perform on a raised platform in the center of
	the bar.
	
	The club is half filled with SPORTS, ENTERTAINMENT and MOB
	TYPES.
	
	The small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the
	platform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the
	BAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:
	
	                JAKE
	      Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	      It's a thrill to be standin' here
	      talking to you wonderful people. In
	      fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.
	      I haven't seen so many people since
	      my last fight at Madison Square
	      Garden. After that fight a reporter
	      asked me, "Jake, where do you go
	      from here?" I said, "To a
	      hospital."
	
	About HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are
	laughing, SOME a little too loud.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      I fought one hundred and six
	      professional fights and none of
	      them bums figured out how to fight
	      me -- they kept hitting me in the
	      head!
	           (calls to the bar)
	      Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? 
	      - get me a drink. I figure if I'm
	      gonna work to drunks I might as
	      well be one of 'em! I like this
	      place. It's a family type club...
	      every night I see a lot of fathers
	      sitting out there with their young
	      daughters! That's nice.
	
	LINDA hands him a drink.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.
	      The kinda girl you wanta take home
	      to meet your father. Especially if
	      your old man's a degenerate! --
	      Here's a toast! "To your health!
	      You only live once. But if you play
	      it right, once is enough." I
	      shouldn't be drinkin' like this
	      'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.
	      I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm
	      allowed to eat anything I want. As
	      long as I don't swallow it! Well, I
	      never had much luck with my weight.
	      In fact, -- I never had much luck
	      with anything -- until about a few
	      years ago, when this happened --
	
	He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,
	of which there is some.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      ... thanks, I'm glad to see you
	      remember. For those of you that
	      don't... that's me takin' the title
	      from Cerdan.
	      You know, the tough thing about
	      winnin' the title... the next thing
	      you gotta do is have a rematch...
	      just to show it wasn't no fluke. So
	      what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a
	      really great champ, after I beat
	      him... he gets himself killed in
	      that airplane crash... a pretty
	      rotten break for him. That's why I
	      don't like to fly. People say to
	      me, "Look, Jake, when your time is
	      up, your time is up." And I say,
	      "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane
	      and the pilot's time is up?" As
	      good as Cerdan was, I could've
	      taken him again. But I never got
	      the chance to prove it wasn't no
	      fluke. He got killed but he got to
	      be what they call a legend. I don't
	      know what's worse -- bein' a fluke
	      or bein' a legend. -- That's the
	      kinda luck I got. That's why I quit
	      the ring and moved down here from
	      New York. My wife said, "You gotta
	      get outa this town, Jake." Come to
	      think of it... the boxing
	      commission said the same thing! But
	      I don't miss New York. Give me
	      Miami any day.
	
	The AUDIENCE applauds.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Miami's a great place. I get along
	      with everybody in this town... even
	      the police force... They got the
	      best cops here money can buy! --
	      Only kiddin'. By the way... me and
	      my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to
	      celibrate our eleventh wedding
	      anniversary.
	
	More applause.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      We get along real great. We fight a
	      little but I never really belted
	      her on purpose. Once  in a while
	      I'm standin' there doin' little
	      shadow-boxin' and she happens to
	      walk right into the shadow... I
	      can't help that.
	      She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"
	      I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a
	      love tap." She says, "It's a good
	      thing you're not crazy about me!" --
	      I am crazy about her. I heard her
	      talkin' to a friend on the phone
	      and she was sayin', "After eleven
	      years, I'm still in love with the
	      same guy." -- If I ever find out
	      who the bum is, I'll kill him!
	      Women. You can't live with 'em, you
	      can't live without 'em.
	
	Then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's
	speech in Othello.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.
	      It is the green-eyed monster, which
	      doth mock the meat it feeds on.
	      That cuckold lives in bliss who,
	      certain of his fate, loves not his
	      woronger; But O, what damned
	      minutes tells he o'er who dotes,
	      yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly
	      loves!" -- That's from somethin'
	      called "Othello" --
	
	OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
	      cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
	      Kissing with inside lip? Stopping
	      the career of laughter with a sign?
	      -- A note infallible of breaking
	      honesty -- horsing foot on foot?
	      Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks
	      more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
	      midnight? and all eyes blind with
	      the pin and web but theirs, theirs
	      only, that would unseen be wicked?
	      Is this nothing? Why, then the
	      world and all that's in't is
	      nothing; The covering sky is
	      nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
	      is nothing; nor nothing have these
	      nothings, if this be nothing." --
	      That's from something called "The
	      Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
	      all remember Shakespeare.
	      He wrote all them famous plays one
	      after the other, then he went into
	      a big slump and he ain't done
	      anything good in years. That speech
	      is about jealousy -- jealousy's a
	      bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot
	      of guys... take me... I almost
	      killed my brother... I love him...
	      he's my family... I mean, there's
	      nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And
	      that's the way we been goin' thru
	      life -- doin' nothin' for each
	      other! Anytime he got in trouble
	      when we was kids, I got him out of
	      it. You know, he used to steal
	      little things when we was growin'
	      up. But he was particular... only
	      stole things that begin with an 'a'
	      -- a watch, a car, a suit, a
	      ring... But I was wrong... I
	      shoulda never hit my brother.
	      Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every
	      time I need somethin' I gotta go
	      shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
	      once told me, "When you hit your
	      brother you're really hittin' your
	      mother, but you can't admit it to
	      yourself." He's really crazy. I
	      woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
	      only in self-defense!
	
	INT. JAKE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY (1950)
	
	JAKE is struggling with his later model ten-inch RCA TV. He
	fools with the dials, then slaps the side. The bluish video
	image comes and goes. JOEY watches JAKE fix the TV.
	
	JAKE has a half-eaten sandwich in his hand.
	
	VICKIE enters the house, surprised to find JAKE home.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake, you're home.
	
	JAKE looks up at her. (She goes over to him and kisses him.)
	MOVING SHOT.
	
	JOEY gives VICKIE a polite peck on the mouth. MOVING SHOT.
	
	                JOEY
	      Hi, Vickie.
	
	JAKE watches JOEY kiss VICKIE. VICKIE notices JAKE'S
	reaction.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What's the matter with you?
	
	                JAKE
	      Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to
	      work. Paid all this money for it
	      and still can't get a station a
	      mile away. And Mr. Wizard here
	      ain't no help.
	
	                JOEY
	      Screw you, Jack.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Vickie)
	      Where you been?
	
	VICKIE goes into the bedroom to take off her coat. On the
	stairs, MOVING SHOT:
	
	                VICKIE
	      I went out.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Joey)
	      What's that kissing on the mouth
	      shit?
	
	                JOEY
	      What? I just said hello. Since when
	      I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
	
	                JAKE
	      Ain't a cheek ever good enough for
	      you? I never even kissed Mama on
	      the mouth.
	
	                JOEY
	      Well, you're not supposed to kiss
	      your mother on the mouth.
	
	                JAKE
	      Well, that's what I mean.
	
	JAKE leans over the TV.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      How's that?
	
	                JOEY
	      I can't tell. You're stomach's in
	      the way.
	
	JAKE stares at JOEY.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Don't give me those looks. I'm just
	      your manager. The minute you start
	      to be champ, you start eating like
	      there's no tomorrow. And you giving
	      me looks. All I know is that I
	      don't have to defend my title next
	      month.
	
	JAKE looks up at JOEY.
	
	                JAKE
	      Answer me somethin'. What happened
	      at the Copa with Salvy when I was
	      out of town?
	
	                JOEY
	      When?
	
	                JAKE
	      You know, when you gave him a
	      beatin'.
	
	                JOEY
	           (being as vague as
	           possible)
	      Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He
	      was drunk or somethin', I dunno.
	      Anyway, the windup was I gave him a
	      beatin'. Tommy called me down, and
	      we straightened it out. It's all
	      forgotten about.
	
	                JAKE
	      Why didn't you tell me about it?
	
	                JOEY
	      It didn't have nothin' to do with
	      you.
	
	                JAKE
	      Didn't it have nothin' to do with
	      me?
	
	                JOEY
	      No, I just told you what happened.
	
	                JAKE
	           (he obviously knows)
	      Who did it have anything to do
	      with... Vickie?
	
	                JOEY
	      Jack, no. I just explained the
	      whole thing to you. It was just
	      between me and Salvy, if it had
	      anything to do with you and Vickie,
	      I woulda told you about it.
	
	                JAKE
	      Well, I heard some things.
	
	MOVING in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.
	
	                JOEY
	      "You heard some things." Will you
	      stop worryin' about that shit?
	      Forget about it. You know you got a
	      title fight comin' up.
	
	PAUSE.
	
	                JOEY
	           (refering to the TV)
	      Whatever you touched, that's good
	      now.
	
	                JAKE
	      Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
	
	                JOEY
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      You're supposed to keep an eye on
	      her for me. I'm askin'...
	
	                JOEY
	           (interrupting)
	      I did keep an eye...
	
	                JAKE
	      Then why did you give him a beatin'
	      if he didn't do anything? You and
	      him been friends a long time.
	
	                JOEY
	      Some things changed between us.
	      Now, he thinks who the fuck he is.
	      He's been passing certain remarks
	      that I don't like.
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't
	      tellin' me the truth.
	
	                JOEY
	      What bullshit? Hey, I'm your
	      brother. You wanna believe me - you
	      trust me?
	
	                JAKE
	      When it comes to her, I don't trust
	      nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
	
	                JOEY
	      Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm
	      tellin" you what happened. He got
	      outta line, we had a fight, and
	      it's staightened out now.
	
	There is a pause. (Move in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.)
	
	                JAKE
	           (suspicious)
	      You givin' me that look. I gotta
	      accept your word, but if I find out
	      anythin', I'm gonna kill
	      somebody...
	
	                JOEY
	           (yelling)
	      So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill
	      Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy
	      Como, kill me while you're at it.
	      What do I care? You're killing
	      yourself the way you're eating, the
	      way you worry about things you
	      don't have to worry about.
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      What do you mean, "you"?
	
	                JOEY
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting, catching
	           Joey)
	      What do you mean, "you"?
	
	                JOEY
	           (caught)
	      I meant, kill everybody. You or me
	      or anybody. You're a big shot.
	      Kill, kill... g'head.
	
	                JAKE
	      But you said "you."
	
	                JOEY
	      So what?
	
	                JAKE
	      Eh, Joey, even you don't know what
	      you meant. You mentioned Salvy,
	      Tommy Como, you -- that means
	      somethin'. Why'd you say them? You
	      coulda said anybody.
	
	                JOEY
	      You're worried about this girl,
	      you're gonna let this girl ruin
	      you're life for you... You wanna
	      worry, worry about your fuckin'
	      stomach that you can't bend over --
	      that you gotta step in the ring in
	      a month.
	
	                JAKE
	      Did you ever fuck my wife?
	
	                JOEY
	      What?
	
	                JAKE
	      I don't mean now. I mean before --
	      before we met.
	
	                JOEY
	      Whadda ya mean?
	
	                JAKE
	      Did you ever fuck my wife?
	
	                JOEY
	      Whatsa matter with you?
	
	                JAKE
	      You're very smart, Joey, very
	      smart. Nobody gives me a straight
	      answer around here.
	      You're givin' me these answers, but
	      you still didn't answer my
	      question. Did you fuck Vickie?
	
	                JOEY
	           (fed up, he starts to
	           leave)
	      I gotta go. I gotta get outta here.
	      I can't take this shit. Lenore is
	      waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're
	      a definite wacko. You're fuckin'
	      crazy, you know that, crazy.

	INT. THE BEDROOM
	
	JAKE walks over to VICKIE. (MOVE in on VICKIE - JAKE'S P.O.V.

	                JAKE
	      Where you been all day?
	
	                VICKIE
	      I took the kids to my sister's.
	
	                JAKE
	      I called. You weren't there.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I got bored so I went to the
	      movies.
	
	                JAKE
	      What'd you see?
	
	                VICKIE
	      I went to the movies.
	
	                JAKE
	      What'd you see?
	
	                VICKIE
	      "Father of the Bride."
	
	                JAKE
	      What was it about?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I
	      have to tell you everything?
	
	                JAKE
	      Did you ever go to the Copa when I
	      was away?
	
	                VICKIE
	      What're you talking about?
	
	                JAKE
	      Answer me when I talk to you. What
	      happened that night?
	
	                VICKIE
	           (interrupting, yelling)
	      I am answering...
	
	                JAKE
	           (hits her)
	      What do I have to do to get a
	      straight answer around here.
	
	JAKE holds onto her, but she gets away.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake, no --
	
	                JAKE
	           (as he chases her around
	           the room)
	      Do I have to kill you, eh?
	           (hits her)
	      Do I have to kill somebody to get
	      an answer?
	           (hits her)
	      I know about you at the Copa. I
	      know all about it.
	
	JAKE catches her.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I didn't do anything wrong. I

	      I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy
	      was there.
	           (gets hit)
	      Stop it. I just had a drink, that's
	      all. I didn't do anything wrong.

	      Come out of there! Did you fuck
	      Salvy?
	           (punches door)
	      Answer me. Open this fuckin' door,
	      you fuckin' cunt!

	           (hits her)
	      I can't trust nobody.

	She finally manages to push him away.

	      All right, I fucked everybody! Go
	      ahead, kill me, kill me.
	
	VICKIE takes JAKE's hand and hits herself. JAKE is stunned.
	
	                VICKIE (CONT'D)
	      I'll say anything you want me to
	      say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked
	      Tommy. I fucked your brother. I
	      fucked everybody! What do you want
	      to hear? I sucked your brother's
	      fuckin' cock!
	
	                JAKE
	      You did?
	
	                VICKIE
	      Yeah, I sucked his cock.

	JOEY is at the kitchen table eating lunch with his family.
	His wife, LENORE, her hair done up in pin curls, sits next to
	him. JOEY's TWO KIDS sit across the table from them,
	bickering.
	
	                JOEY
	           (to kids)
	      Don't hit your brother! Be nice.
	
	Suddenly, JAKE comes through the front door, goes directly to
	the table, grabs JOEY, lifts him into the air, and starts
	hitting him.
	
	                JOEY (CONT'D)
	      Jake, stop it.
	
	JAKE keeps hitting JOEY. The KIDS start to cry. LENORE wants
	to stop the fight, but is afraid to get too close.
	
	                JAKE
	      Was Vickie part of the deal with
	      Tommy? Was my wife part of the
	      deal? Tell me, was that it?
	
	                JOEY
	      Stop it. What're you, crazy?
	
	JAKE drags JOEY into the living room, and pushes him onto the
	floor.
	
	                JAKE
	           (kneeling over Joey and
	           hitting him)
	      You didn't tell me. You didn't tell
	      me. You let me marry her. You let
	      me marry her.
	
	VICKIE rushes into the house, past LENORE and the TWO KIDS
	who are screaming even louder now.
	
	                VICKIE
	           (hitting Jake on his back
	           as he hits Joey)
	      You're killing him. You're killing
	      him for nothing. Stop it.
	
	                JAKE
	           (hits her)
	      Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you
	      mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
	
	                VICKIE
	           (still hitting Jake)
	      Nothing is what I said! Go on, kull
	      me.
	           (hits him)
	      Kill me.
	           (hits him)
	      I'm not afraid of you anymore. I
	      don't care if you kill me like
	      you're killing him. You're a sick
	      animal.
	
	JOEY is knocked out. LENORE goes over to him and holds him.
	
	                JAKE
	           (to Vickie)
	      You're the fuckin' animal! You ran
	      around with every guy I knew while
	      I was breakin' my ass for you.
	
	                VICKIE
	           (as she pushes and hits
	           Jake to the front door)
	      You're not only an animal, you're a
	      stupid animal.
	           (pushes and hits him out
	           the front door)
	      You're rotten.
	           (hits him)
	      Rotten.
	           (hits him)
	      Rotten.

	      Well, he ain't dead in case you're
	      interested.
	           (pause)
	      I'm leaving you. And I don't care

	           (pause)
	      I'm leaving tonight. I must have

	      Aw, Vickie, aw Vickie, please no.
	      Vickie, no... don't leave me.
	      Christ, I'm pleading... I know, I
	      know all the bad things, but I need

	The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told
	through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER. JAKE is
	not doing well.
	
	                RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER
	      ... Ladies and gentlemen, I've sat
	      in front of these microphones for
	      over twenty years but this is the
	      strangest championship bout I've
	      ever seen. With two minutes to go
	      in the final round, the champion,
	      the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is
	      just simply taking punch after
	      punch from the challenger.
	      Dauthuille scores a combination,
	      then backpedals. LaMotta pursues
	      him. One minute to go. Laurent
	      DauthuiLlle, who has already beat
	      Lamotta in a non-title bout, is
	      about to fulfill a dream -- to
	      bring the middleweight crown back
	      to France.
	
	In the ring, JAKE looks like he's on queer street. Bouncing
	off the ropes, opening his jaw to DAUTHUILLE. But
	DAUTHUILLE's punches lack strength. JAKM is playing possum.
	
	                RINGSIDE'ANNOUNCER
	      Thirty seconds to go. The Bull
	      starts to swing. LaMotta comes in
	      for a brutal body combinaticn: one,
	      two, three, four punches. LaMotta
	      has landed a solid left hook to the
	      Frenchman's jaw! Dauthuille seems
	      confused. LaMotta is swinging
	      wildly now: right, left, right,
	      left! Dauthuille is backing off!
	      Everyone is on their feet! I can
	      hardly see, ladies and gentlemen.
	      Dauthuille is on the ropes. LaMotta
	      hits a right -- Dauthuille is down!
	      Dauthuille is down! Referee Lou
	      Handler is counting him out --
	      three, four, five -- if Dauthuille
	      can stand, he'll win the decision --
	      eight, nine --  Dauthuille is on
	      one knee -- ten! It's all over!
	      With thirteen seconds left on the
	      clock, Jake LaMotta has retained
	      his middleweight championship in
	      one of the most remarkable combacks
	      in boxing! Dauthuille is standing
	      now, confused. But the fight is
	      over.
	
	AN ANNOUNCER holds up JAKE's victorious hand. He seems as
	surprised as everyone else.
	
	TONY throws JAKE'S robe around his shoulders as THE ANNOUNCER
	calls out:
	
	                ANNOUNCER
	      The middleweight champion, and
	      still champion by a knockout in
	      fifteen rounds, the Bronx Bull, the
	      Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta!

	           (continuing his monologue)
	      I shoulda never hit my brother.
	      Afterwards I was sorry. Now every
	      time I need somethin' I gotta go
	      shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
	      once told me, "When you hit your
	      brother you're really hittin' your
	      mother but you can't admit it to
	      yourself." He's really crazy. I
	      woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
	      only in self-defense! A lot of
	      people wanta know who was the best
	      guy I ever fought. Let's see...
	      there was that one I fought
	      twice... the other Frenchman... you
	      know who I mean...
	           (having trouble
	           pronouncing the name)
	      ... Dauthuille! He was tough, but I
	      beat him... I had to! I mean, how
	      would it sound losin' to a guy
	      whose name you can't even
	      pronounce? But... Robinson. I can
	      say that alright. I fought Sugar
	      Ray so many times it's a wonder I
	      don't have diabetes! Linda... get
	      me another drink! Linda's the most
	      popular waitress here... you can

	ROBINSON makes his move. His arms are a blur, swinging
	rapidly but accurately.
	
	JOEY and LENORE are suddenly silent.
	
	                TV ANNOUNCER
	      LaMotta's on queer street, but he's
	      still standing. Robinson throws a
	      right, a left, a right, a right and
	      a right again! How can LaMotta stay
	      on his feet?
	
	On the TV, WE SEE that ROBINSON has JAKE up against the
	ropes. He's giving JAKE a pier six beating. It's the Fox
	fight for real.
	
	JAKE's face is so soaked in blood that it's impossible to
	pinpoint the cuts.
	
	                TV ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
	      No man can take this kind of
	      punishment. LaMotta is just a rag
	      doll now. God knows what's holding
	      him up. This is an historic
	      beating. Sugar Rav staggers LaMotta
	      with a left and comes across with a
	      blackjack punch to the champion's
	      head. The referee is stepping in,
	      Robinson has LaMotta on the ropes.
	      That's it! Sugar Ray Robinson,
	      former welterweight champion, has
	      taken the middleweight crown from
	      Jake LaMota.
	
	As the REFEREE stops the fight, JOEY sighs with relief.
	
	INT. CHICAGO STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	LAMOTTA, a bloody and beaten fighter, walks over to the
	victorious ROBINSON and puts his arm on his shoulder.
	
	                JAKE
	      You never knocked me down. You
	      could never knock me down.
	
	ROBINSON, receiving congratulations from every direction,
	takes time to turn to JAKE and say:
	
	                ROBINSON
	      So what?
	
	EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY (JUNE 2, 1954)
	
	ESTABLISHING SHOT. The house is quite large, and has
	beautiful landscaping and a swimming pool.
	
	INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
	
	JAKE, wearing sportclothes that can't hide his paunch, and
	VICKIE, wearing a dress and looking her best, sit in the
	living room with their THREE CHILDREN (the TWO BOYS, and also
	a GIRL, about two years old).
	
	A still PHOTOGRAPHER clicks pictures of JAKE and VICKIE as
	TWO REPORTERS talk with JAKE.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's
	      TV bout 'cause I can't make the
	      weight. I'm fighting at light
	      heavyweight, and I still can't make
	      the weight.
	
	                REPORTER
	      Does that mean...
	
	                JAKE
	      It means I'm through with boxing.
	      I'm tired with tryin' to make the
	      weight anymore. I'm sick of
	      thinkin' about weight, weight,
	      weight.
	
	                REPORTER
	      You sound bitter.
	
	                JAKE
	      Why should I be bitter? Boxing's
	      been good to me. I got a nice
	      house, three kids, a beautiful wife
	      -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
	
	VICKIE poses dutifully.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been
	      Mrs. America if I didn't pull her
	      outa the contest. Didn't want her
	      wearing a swimsuit for nobody but
	      me.
	
	                REPORTER
	      What do you think of Jake's
	      retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
	
	JAKE cuts in:
	
	                JAKE
	      I also bought a club on Collins
	      Avenue, and I'm gonna open it real
	      soon. Know what I'm gonna call it?
	      "Jake LaMotta's."
	
	INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)
	
	JAKE, an empty glass in his hand, stands on the bar platform.
	He's wearing a white tuxedo jacket with a red rose in the
	lapel. His tuxedo shirt is stained. He continues his
	monologue.
	
	                JAKE
	      Valentine's Day. The anniversary of
	      the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
	      Robinsin didn't use a machine gun
	      but it was still a massacre...
	           (takes another drink)
	      Actually, I was doin' okay at
	      first. In fact, by the end of the
	      fifth round I really had him
	      worried --- he thought he killed
	      me. You know, I could keep tellin'
	      you this brilliant material all
	      night -- but you'd only laugh. Now
	      I'm gonna sing. -- Any requests? I
	      mean, besides "don't"!
	           (then to piano player)
	      -- In the key of H.
	           (then to audience)
	      You're laughin'. Give me the right
	      key and I'll play in anybody's
	      flat! I sing for a reason. When I
	      finish, you'll be so sobered up,
	      we'll sell a lot of booze.
	
	JAKE's onstage version of "That's Entertainment" differs from
	the backstage version. It's not just that he's a little drunk
	-- no, his voice is defiant, sadly defiant. He is singing at
	the PATRONS rather than to them.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      "When the fighter's not engaged in
	      his employment, his employment,
	      although he was Champ and quite the
	      rage, he must go somewhere else to
	      seek employment, seek employment.
	      So what does he do? He goes upon
	      the stage and meets his true
	      adversaries, all you members of the
	      human race. But a fighter's life is
	      not a bowl of cherries, still I'd
	      rather have an egg than a fist upon
	      my face... That's Entertainment!
	
	JAKE brings the BAND to a crescendo with a wave of his hand,
	then silences it. The spotlight goes out and there is a
	hearty round of applause.
	
	JAKE receives the kisses, glad handshakes and congratulations
	of the PATRONS as he works his way around the club.
	
	JAKE's new friends love him. They are PARTY GIRLS, SPORTS
	FIGURES, COLUMNISTS, MOBSTERS, B ACTORS, and OTHER
	"CELEBRITIES."
	
	JAKE poses for a still with TWO BUXOM YOUNG LOVELIES. ONE
	GIRL giggles as he fondles her. After the flash goes off, the
	GIRLS admire his "small, delicate" hands.
	
	JAKE steps over to a table and greets J.R., a newspaper
	columnist, and his COMPANIONS.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      J.R., glad you could make it.
	
	                J.R.
	      You were great, Jake. Just like old
	      times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't
	      here tonight. Oh Jake, this is
	      State's Attorney Bronson and his
	      wife.
	
	JAKE shakes his hand, then holds it up -- showing an empty
	palm.
	
	                JAKE
	           (joking)
	      Sorry, empty! Heh, heh! Oh, I
	      didn't mean that. If I don't give
	      your husband no money, he won't
	      have enough to buy you a drink. To
	      show you I'm a nice guy, this one's
	      on me. The last one was your
	      payment for this month.
	
	BRONSON is embarrassed. He doesn't think the joke is funny,
	but he manages a smile. His WIFE gives a nervous laugh. JAKE
	leans over and kisses her.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      You're a good sport, lady.
	
	                J.R.
	      I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in
	      '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were
	      great.
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
	
	                J.R.
	      Where's your wife, Jake?
	
	                JAKE
	      Do you think I'd let her in a place
	      like this with guys like you
	      hangin' around?
	
	JAKE feigns a few jabs, and they all laugh. He walks off.
	
	As JAKE leaves, J.R. whispers to his FRIEND:
	
	                J. R.
	      You ought to see his wife.
	
	JAKE steps over to a table where some of the "BOYS" are
	sitting. RICKY is the Miami 1956 version of Salvy.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, Ricky, glad you came.
	
	                RICKY
	      Wouldn't miss it, Jake.
	
	JAKE calls a WAITRESS over.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, honey, give these fellas a
	      round on me. I can tell they're
	      gonna be regular customers.
	
	The WAITRESS says to a clearly underaged GIRL:
	
	                WAITRESS
	      I'll have to ask for your I.D.
	
	JAKE leans over and gives the young GIRL a long kiss on the
	lips. She enthusiastically reciprocates.
	
	                JAKE
	      Whew! Any girl that can kiss like
	      that can drink in my club any time!
	
	They all laugh as JAKE moves on. The life of the party.
	
	EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - DAY
	
	JAKE, hungover, his tux wrinkled, walks out of the club to
	the adjacent parking lot.
	
	VICKIE is sitting in her yellow Cadillac outside the Club.
	The curbside window is halfway up. She calls to him:
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake.
	
	JAKE, chagrined, steps over to the car.
	
	                JAKE
	      I'm sorry. I had to work late last
	      night. Slept at the club.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I'm leaving your Jake.
	
	                JAKE
	      Sure, what else is new?
	
	                VICKIE
	      No. This time it's true. I didn't
	      bother to tell you until I had
	      everything worked out.
	
	JAKE tries to open the door. It's locked.
	
	                JAKE
	      Open the door, Vickie.
	
	                VICKIE
	      No. I won't talk to you where you
	      can use your hands on me.
	
	                JAKE
	      Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
	
	                VICKIE
	      I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting
	      a divorce. I'm getting custody of
	      the kids.
	
	                JAKE
	      Aw, c'mon, Vick --
	
	                VICKIE
	      I'm sick of it. I can't watch you
	      this way. You're too drunk all the
	      time. There's too many girls. I
	      can't... I don't wanna talk about
	      it. I made up my mind.
	
	JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power
	switch, closing it and catching his hand. She now has to yell
	to him:
	
	                VICKIE (CONT'D)
	      You got three days to get your
	      stuff out of the house. After that,
	      the cops will be there. I have the
	      kids with me. I never want to see
	      you again.
	
	VICKIE turns her face and drives away.
	
	JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger
	than him.
	
	JAKE is left alone in the parking lot. The car is gone.
	
	INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - DAY (JAN. 9, 1957)
	
	JAKE has an office above the lounge. Ever since VICKIE left,
	it's also been his apartment.
	
	The place is a mess. JAKE sends his laundry out when he runs
	out of clean clothes. Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are
	scattered randomly. Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty
	beer cans in the wastebasket.
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	      Let's go, Jake, wake up!
	
	                JAKE
	      Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?

	      We're from...
	
	                JAKE
	           (interrupting)
	      I know where you're from. You guys
	      look the same every place.
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	      They wanna talk to you.
	
	                JAKE
	      About what?
	
	                1ST DEPUTY
	      I don't run the joint. They just
	      told me to bring you in.
	
	                JAKE
	      For what?
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      C'mon, get dressed.
	
	JAKE hunts for his clothes.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, I'm a big tax payer down here.
	      Don't that entitle me to some
	      information what this is all about?
	
	The SECOND DEPUTY shows JAKE a photo.
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      You recognize this girl? She been
	      in the club?
	
	                JAKE
	      I dunno.
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      She says you introduced her to men.
	
	                JAKE
	      I introduced a lot of people to
	      men. So what? What does that mean?
	
	                2ND DEPUTY
	      She's fourteen.
	
	CLOSE UP of picture.
	
	EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
	
	JAKE, wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the
	bell.
	
	VICKIE opens the door and looks at him over the chain.
	
	                JAKE
	      Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Are you drunk?
	
	                JAKE
	      No. Open the door.
	
	JAKE tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but
	she steps back.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Please, Vick. I won't bother you.
	      I'm out on bail. You can send the
	      kids next door. I just gotta pick
	      one thing up, then I'll get outa
	      here.
	
	VICKIE thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets JAKE in.
	
	                VICKIE
	      The kids are sleeping.
	
	                JAKE
	      I promise I just gotta pick up one
	      thing.
	
	                VICKIE
	      All right, just don't make any
	      noise.
	
	INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
	
	JAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE
	watches from a safe distance.
	
	JAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the
	glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.
	
	In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a
	drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts
	digging the jewels out of it.
	
	VICKIE appears in the doorway.
	
	                VICKIE
	      What are you doing?
	
	                JAKE
	      I need ten thousand dollars. My
	      lawyer says if we can spread ten
	      thousand bucks around, we can get
	      the case dropped.
	
	                VICKIE
	      But they don't have a case against
	      you.
	
	                JAKE
	           (digging at the belt)
	      Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a
	      14-year-old testify in court? Did
	      you see the papers? "LaMotta on
	      Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot
	      at the Champ.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Jake, be careful! What're you doing
	      to the belt?!
	
	                JAKE
	      Don't make no difference no more.
	
	                VICKIE
	      Can't you get the money from your
	      friends?
	
	                JAKE
	      What friends?
	
	JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers
	at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.
	JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.
	
	INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY
	
	JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The
	JEWELER examines the stones.
	
	                JEWELER
	      Didn't you also wish to sell the
	      Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?
	
	                JAKE
	      That's it. Those are the jewels
	      that were in the belt.
	
	                JEWELER
	      But where's the belt?
	
	                JAKE
	      You want the jewels or the belt?
	
	                JEWELER
	      Both. These stones are worth about
	      fifteen hudred dollars, but the
	      belt of a champion is a very rare
	      item. The belt with the stones
	      untouched would have been worth
	      near five thousand dollars.
	
	JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the
	attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.
	
	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
	
	JAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.
	
	                JAKE
	           (on phone)
	      I can't raise the ten thousand.
	      Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.
	
	INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Same as Scene 1.
	
	JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated
	across from a mirror.
	
	                JAKE
	      So there I am in the can... and not
	      the one that says "gentlemen" on
	      the door. I'm talkin' about jail!
	      Down south!
	      I mean, jail up north is gotta be
	      like summer camp compared to jail
	      down in cracker country. And if
	      you're a guy like me, you ain't got
	      a chance in a place like that.
	      Especially if you're Italian... you
	      come from the Bronx... and you're
	      an ex-champ. As soon as they saw
	      me... soon as they heard me... I
	      know I'm in trouble. To me, they
	      got an accent, and to them, I got
	      an accent! You gotta get the
	      picture -- I'm big, I got small
	      hands, I walk like I'm still in the
	      ring... the balls of my feet pop up
	      and down, you know... and whenever
	      I get the chance, I read a lot. So
	      naturally, takin' all this into
	                                      co
	      sideration, they figure it adds up
	      to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I
	      didn't mind too much when they
	      called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough
	      Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one
	      day these screws got to me... I was
	      workin' on the work gang, pickin'
	      up some trees that were knocked
	      down by a storm or somethin' and
	      puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a
	      sudden... one of the trees slipped
	      and fell on me and pinned me to the
	      ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree
	      across my chest! This screw walks
	      over, takin' his time, he looks
	      down at me and says, "Well, Champ
	      Pimp... you lyin' down on the job
	      again?"! They got a great sense of
	      humor when they're standin' there
	      with a gun in their arms and you
	      got a tree on your chest! So I look
	      up at him and say, "Oh, this
	      tree... it fell on me." And he
	      says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have
	      known, I would've yelled 'timber'"
	      I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I
	      think maybe I broke somethin'!" He
	      says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ
	      PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then
	      I got as stupid as him. I said, "If
	      I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'
	      me the money you made last night?"!
	      Then another screw comes over and
	      says, "This Yankee creep givin' you
	      trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?
	      What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with
	      the tree? Now anybody else in their
	      right mind would've said, "No sir,
	      I wouldn't think of giving any of
	      you gentlemen trouble... I just
	      want to serve my time and get the
	      hell out of here as soon as I can."
	      That's anybody else. When I said
	      it... it was a little different.
	      "You stupid cracker... take your
	      hands off me or I'll get up and
	      kick your brains out -- but first
	      you gotta bend over so I can find
	      'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the
	      hole. Solitary confinement. All my
	      life I had guys in my corner
	      yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill
	      'em! You're the greatest." Now
	      there's nobody rootin' for me. But
	      it wasn't so bad. I learned things
	      there. I learned how to scratch a
	      calendar on the wall. I never knew
	      how to do that before. Now I know.
	      Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is
	      two scratches. Wednesday is three
	      scratches. And so on. Except for
	      Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.
	      Sundays rested.
	
	INT. DADE COUNTY STOCKADE - DAY
	
	The CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade
	County Prison. Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.
	
	JAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and
	legs are manacled and chained.
	
	The GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in
	working JAKE over.
	
	They take JAKE to the "Hole" -- solitary confinement.
	
	ONE of the GUARDS unmanacles JAKE.
	
	Both GUARDS push JAKE into the cell and slam the door.
	
	INT. THE HOLE - DAY OR NIGHT
	
	A thin slit provides the only light in JAKE's cell.
	
	The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti. The
	8x8x8 room features only a cot and a toilet.
	
	The room is mostly darkness. Sounds are more tangible here
	than sights.
	
	WE SEE JAKE's body as it passes through the slit of light.
	
	JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light. As WE SEE
	JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear.
	
	(There will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the
	images: for example, the image of JAKE hitting VICKIE might
	be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.)
	
	A) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men
	and women engaged in explicit sex acts.
	
	B) Boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. A
	body building ad: Charles Atlas raises his muscled biceps.
	
	C) Li'l Abner comics; Daisy Mae's tits seem about to fall
	free.
	
	D) Reprise from earlier scene: Back in JAKE and IRMA's old
	apartment, JOEY, using a towel as a glove, punches JAKE in
	the face.
	
	E) A 1934 "OLDER GIRL" sashays into the candy store in
	flickering 8mm black and white footage. WE SEE ohter Bronx
	PRETEEN GIRLS walking, smiling.
	
	F) At Shorehaven pool, JAKE and JOEY, in bathing suits, are
	sleeping in the sun next to each other. OTHER BATHERS are
	around, also taking in the sun.
	
	G) Reprise from earlier scene: As in D, JOEY hits JAKE in the
	face again.
	
	WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
	
	The MONTAGE continues:
	
	H) JANIRO's face at the weigh-in.
	
	I) JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss at the weigh-in.
	
	J) JAKE punches in JANIRO's face.
	
	K) A naked GIRL stands in the doorway of a bedroom.
	
	L) JAKE lies in bed with IRMA staring at the ceiling.
	
	M) VICKIE's pretty young face DOUBLE EXPOSES with SUGAR RAY
	ROBINSON's.
	
	N) DR. PINTO injects novacaine into JAKE's fists.
	
	O) Sitting in his corner of the ring, JAKE spits blood into a
	pail...
	
	P) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY wipes off his brother's
	bloody face.
	
	Q) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's
	eye. JOEY, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the
	wound as DR. PINTO begins to examine it.
	
	R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's
	mouth. (SLOW MOTION)
	
	S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE
	on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a
	quick look, but JOEY just embraces him.
	
	T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and
	looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club.
	JAKE stares.
	
	U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face.
	
	V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to
	break it.
	
	W) JAKE hits LINDA again. She cries.
	
	X) Repeat image N: DR. PINTO injects novocaine into JAKE's
	fists.
	
	WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
	
	The MONTAGE continues:
	
	Y) VICKIE is in her underwear in a bedroom. A pair of black
	arms come in and embrace her body.
	
	Z) CLOSE UP of JAKE; he reacts to this. He's in the ring with
	SUGAR RAY. He knocks SUGAR RAY out of the ring.
	
	AA) VICKIE again. JAKE approaches her from behind, pulls her
	head back by her hair, and slaps her.
	
	BB) THE ANNOUNCER points to SUGAR RAY as the winner.
	(Different fight.) CAMERA PANS to RAY, victorious, his arms
	up.
	
	CC) A bloodied JAKE comes over to SUGAR RAY and embraces him.
	
	WE ARE BACK WITH JAKE in the cell. He slowly starts to bang
	his head against the wall.
	
	                JAKE
	           (murmuring)
	      Why, why, why?
	           (with each bang of his
	           head)
	      I'm a man, I'm a man. I'm no
	      faggot. I'm not a faggot. Ma, why?
	      What do they want? My cock's not
	      enough. What do they want from me?
	      Why? Ma? Why?
	
	JAKE is now smashing the wall with all his strength --
	vicious body punches.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Why, why, why me? You took it away
	      from me. They took everything away.
	      What do they want from me? What the
	      fuck do they want from me? I ain't
	      bad. I ain't bad. I'm not that guy.
	      I'm not that guy. I'm not a
	      monster. I'm not an animal.
	
	JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.
	
	JAKE collapses to the concrete floor. His hands are smashed.
	He cries, then sobs.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      I'm not like that. Please. I'm not
	      like that. Please. Please. Please.
	
	Then silence.
	
	We begin to hear: JAKE doing a monologue.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      And so, as Shakespeare said, I've
	      been down so low there's nowhere
	      else to go.
	
	INT. METROPOLE - NIGHT (1958)
	
	The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square.
	
	JAKE LAMOTTA, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit,
	continues his monologue.
	
	                JAKE
	      Except here, gentlemen, with you
	      bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but
	      you know what you really are! You
	      know, this place used to be pretty
	      exclusive... now they got bouncers
	      outside to throw the drunks in! My
	      first night here I said to the
	      boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He
	      said, "You're in it!" By the way,
	      this engagement is just a stepping
	      stone for me. If I do good here,
	      I'm ready to get out of the
	      business!
	
	The CROWD starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage!"
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      OK, OK, I know what you're waitin'
	      for -- and from the looks of you,
	      you been waitin' for it for a long
	      time. I had my own joint in Miami
	      Beach once... it was too high-class
	      for you guys... we had a 50-cent
	      minimum charge just to keep out the
	      riff-raff!
	
	The CROWD continues to shout, as before, also shouting:
	"Bring out the girls!"
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Hey, sorry. Here's your girls.
	           (grabs his crotch)
	      Yeah, she's here... just like it's
	      advertised out front. She's come
	      back. A girl who's seen the Lower
	      Depths... who's been as far as I
	      have in that direction. She's on
	      her way back up now... give you an
	      idea how low she was! Let's give
	      her a warm welcome... make her glad
	      she's back, boys. -- Miss Emma
	      48's!
	
	JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her
	dance. He goes over to the bar and gets a drink. SEVERAL
	OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at
	the bar.
	
	EXT. METROPOLE - NIGHT
	
	The Club is closing. JAKE and EMMA, the stripper, come out
	and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot.
	
	JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen.
	
	                JAKE
	      Look, sweetie, be a good girl.
	      Here's some money. Take a cab. Go
	      home by yourself. Just wanna walk
	      around a little, sort of unwind.
	      OK?
	
	                EMMA
	      Will I see you later?
	
	                JAKE
	      Yeah. I dunno... I'll call you.
	
	JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a
	cab.
	
	                                    DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	
	It's about twenty minutes later.
	
	DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.
	He looks at the delicatessen.
	
	JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing
	JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near
	the rear of the outdoor lot.
	
	                JAKE
	      Hey, Joey --
	
	JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.
	
	JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts
	to get into his car.
	
	JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,
	      please --
	
	JOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his
	shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Aw, Joey --
	
	JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand
	on JOEY's shoulder again.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      You're right. You're perfectly
	      right. You got every right in the
	      world to hate my guts.
	
	JOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper
	bag into the front seat of the car.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      No, please. I know I was a
	      cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda
	      never raised my hands to you.
	
	JOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car
	again.
	
	JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      No, Joey, listen to me --
	
	JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to
	his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
	open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
	
	JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he
	belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken
	by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.
	
	JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      Go ahead.
	           (gets punched)
	      Hit me again.
	           (gets punched)
	      I deserve it...
	           (gets punched)
	      Pay me back...
	           (gets punched)
	      More...
	           (gets punched)
	
	JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure
	it out.
	
	JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.
	
	                JAKE (CONT'D)
	      More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.
	
	JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's
	shoulder.
	He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and
	finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to
	fill his eyes.
	
	JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
	
	They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.
	
	EXT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)
	
	The theater lights are flashing.
	
	This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the
	Metropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the
	corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.
	
	A stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An
	Evening with Jake LaMotta." The billboard also lists the
	authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod
	Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.
	
	INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Same as Scenes One and Eighty-One.
	
	JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.
	
	                JAKE
	      You know, I'm not a philosopher or
	      anything like that but I been
	      around a little and the way I look
	      at it is -- We're, all of us,
	      lookin' for the same thing: a shot
	      at the title. No matter what you
	      wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'
	      the best. Well, I had mine and
	      it'll always be in the record
	      books... it don't make no
	      difference what happens to me from
	      here on in -- I got my shot and
	      that's a fact. Some guys weren't
	      that lucky... like the one Marlon
	      Brando played in "On the
	      Waterfront" -- an up and comer
	      who's now a down and outer. You
	      remember... there was this scene in
	      the back of the car with his
	      brother Charlie, a small-time
	      racket guy, and it went somethin'
	      like this -- "It wasn't him,
	      Charlie. It was you. You 'member
	      that night in the Garden you came
	      down my dressing room and said.
	      'Kid, this ain't your night.
	      We're going for the price on
	      Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This
	      ain't your night!' My night -- I
	      coulda taken Wilson apart! So what
	      happens? He gets the title shot
	      outdoors on the ballpark, and what
	      do I get? A one-way ticket to
	      Palookaville. I never was no good
	      after that night. It was like a
	      peak you reach. Then it went
	      downhill. It was you, Charlie. You
	      was my brother, Charlie. You
	      shoulda looked out for me a little
	      bit. You shoulda taken care of me
	      just a little bit so I wouldn't
	      have to take them dives for the
	      short end money... You don't
	      understand! I coulda had class. I
	      coulda been a contender. I coulda
	      been somebody -- instead of a bum,
	      which is what I am. Let's face it.
	      It was you, Charlie."
	
	A shadow goes by the frame; it's a STAGEHAND.
	
	                STAGEHAND (O.S.)
	      Hey Jake, how you doing?
	
	The shadow exits.
	
	                JAKE
	      How long do I have?
	
	The shadow pops in again.
	
	                STAGEHAND (O.S.)
	      About five minutes
	
	The shadow exits.
	
	                JAKE
	      OK.
	
	JAKE pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room.
	
	His breath comes in quick gasps. His feet pop up and down
	like they were on canvas. His tiny fists jerk forward with
	short bursts of light.
	
	Still alive. Still a contender. A 42-year-old man fighting
	for his shot.
	
	The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit
	the empty air -- in and out of the frame.
	
	This quote appears: (Music in)
	  		
	"Verily, verily I say unto thee,
	  Except a man be born again,
	  He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven..."
	
	                                                 John 3-3
	
	The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS.
	
	The END CREDITS roll up.
	
	                       THE END
Rambling Rose - by Calder Willingham

 

FADE IN:

EXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.
A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.

CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is
WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and
the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,
ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like
everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,
trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as
he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his
ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks
to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his
aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to
them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive.
We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track --
it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but
now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if
slightly annoyed by something.

CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man
at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and
looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE,
erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not
been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness,
he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very
unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline
representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily.
He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat.
We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the
track.

CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with
a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't
place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns
back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously
saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl,
turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance
away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the
tall, gaunt man at the next counter.

CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than
the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline
representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his
head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is
saying: "I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist.
What's the matter with this friggin' airline?"

CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he
rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the
man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry
Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place
the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on
Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at
this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a
distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played
with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong
in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC
becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost
to know the man.

MAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): "RAMBLING ROSE"

The MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard.

OTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action.

VARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to
recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug,
turns and walks away with his travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY

We see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the
plane.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive
young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He
is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face
when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real
affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry
and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit
in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley
sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,
then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make
corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.

Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight
frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and
enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the
dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I
will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do
not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will
be obvious from the acting.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(not on track)
	Buddd-dee! My God, if it ain't
	Buddy! Well, if this ain't the
	darnest thing!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an
idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained
embarrassed smile.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(not on track)
	Excuse me... your voice is familiar
	and I'm sure I know you from
	somewhere...

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(not on track, with
		 delighted injury)
	Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know
	me!

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(not on track)
	Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(not on track)
	It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie,
	don't you remember me?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(not on track)
	Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how
	are you?

The men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so.
We see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to
Hillyer.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she
fixes drinks.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives
them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees
the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an
aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to
her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be
polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Well, I am in the construction
	business, Buddy, and without
	braggin' I have done real good at
	it. 
		(with a meaningful
		 bitterness)
	There are those who wouldn't have
	expected that out of me. 
		(pauses as if waiting for
		 a reaction, but Hillyer
		 is very silent)
	Right now I'm buildin' a giant
	motel unit near Alexandria, outside
	Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm
	on the construction side.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(making polite talk)
	Well, that's interesting, Dave. I
	always liked Washington, it's a
	pretty town.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York.
	But the niggers have took it over,
	just like every other city we got,
	only worse.

Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but
Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self
satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	But I have done real good in the
	construction field. What I don't
	know about buildin' ain't worth
	knowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight
	thousand smackeroos last year,
	how's that for an old country boy?

Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down
with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant
smile.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	Ha ha, course you make a lot more. 
		(points at the galleys)
	What's that you got there, Buddy?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(reluctantly)
	Galley proof.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Galley what?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Page proof of a book I'm working
	on.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	How about that. Well, you always
	were a screwball.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(lifts an eyebrow in mild
		 irony)
	Oh, yeah?

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(unfazed)
	I don't mean that the way it
	sounds. 
		(stares at galleys as if
		 rattlesnake)
	Imagine it, a book. And I used to
	know you personal way back when.
		(pauses, then earnestly)
	Tell me something, Buddy, how do
	you dream up all that stuff?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(absolutely straight)
	Well, actually, we have a little
	black boy named Her---t who lives
	in the garage. He does it for me.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(for a moment half
		 believes it, then a slow,
		 stupid grin)
	Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy,
	always jokin' around. Almost as
	much of a joker as your Daddy. 
		(drains his drink,
		 grimaces; a heavy
		 drinker, Dave)
	I saw your Daddy a coupla years
	ago, I was up in Glenville lookin'
	at a motel site. I guess that's
	where you're headed, huh, to see
	him?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(stares out of plane
		 window)
	That's right, Dave, I'm headed for
	Glenville on a whisperin' jet.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(suddenly calls out)
	Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us
	another drink! 
		(to Hillyer, sullenly)
	Dumb little bitch, supposed to give
	us two in the first place.

Willcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at
his temple.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	This friggin' airline's out of its
	mind. 
		(a martyr)
	The sons of bitches tried to put me
	in tourist.
		(portentuously
		 philosophical)
	But our whole civilization is
	screwed up, Buddy. The heebies and
	the coconuts have took it over and
	ruined it.

Willcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says
nothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie
gives him a headache.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings
two more drinks. Dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by
her charm.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Took your time gettin' here.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	She has other things to do, Dave.

Willcox smiles apologetically at girl.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Supposed to get two drinks in the
	first place. This friggin' airline
	can't do nothin' right.

The stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his
drink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl
as if to say, "Don't blame me because of this damned idiot,"
and she half smiles at him.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(obviously getting him off
		 subject)
	Tell me about that job in
	Alexandria, Dave, the big motel
	you're building.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(with pedantic exactitude,
		 the man is a complete
		 pain in the ass)
	Near Alexandria. It isn't in
	Alexandria, it is outside it.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	I see. Outside it.

			DAVE WILKIE
	That's correct -- outside it, not
	in it. As for the job, well, the
	Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of
	grief and we use a pile of niggers
	to haul and tote and they ain't
	worth a sorry-ass damn. 
		(takes big swallow of
		 drink)
	But I can build anything, Buddy.
	Give me the plans and I can build a
	goddamn staircase to the moon. It's
	a fact, I can build anything... 
		(pauses, then bitterly)
	... but she never believed that.
	Oh, hell, no, she never believed in
	me.

This is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown
"she." Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately
unresponsive.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	Um-m, well...

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(broodingly)
	Doubted my ability all along, the
	little bitch. I never remarried,
	Buddy, you know that, don't you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Well, no, I didn't actually.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	She's te reason -- cured me of
	women once and for all. Oh, I got
	rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste
	no time kickin' that bitch out.
	Hell, she was screwin' everybody in
	Savannah. I caught her in a motel
	with this long tall son of a bitch
	and boy did I beat the everlastin'
	piss out of him!

Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it
and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the
man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a
dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade
continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and
pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and
he is struggling to control himself.

Dave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the
hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	She didn't marry him, though, later
	she married another guy and went to
	Winston-Salem. It didn't last
	That girl couldn't have no lastin'
	marriage, she left him and married
	another dumb sucker and went out
	west. Little bitch left him, too,
	and you know what she's married to
	right now?
		(puts a big finger on
		 Hillyer's chest)
	A kike. That's right, some kind of
	kike horse doctor named Schapiro
	out in Seattle, who's got the nerve
	to have the same first name I got.
	Wouldn't you know it, Rose would
	wind up married to a goddamn kike?
	She was always out of her friggin'
	head and I'll tell you why.
		(his eyes narrow and again
		 he puts a finger on
		 Hillyer's chest)
	Buddy, she was sick in her mind and
	between her legs, too. She was
	a nymphomaniac.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
		(he has had enough; with a
		 pale trembling anger and
		 in even tone)
	Dave, you are as full of shit as a
	Christmas turkey and you know it.
	Now if you want to start a fight on
	this plane and get yourself in
	jail, go right ahead. But I am
	telling you, you are full of shit
	right up to your eyeballs.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(with surprising mildness;
		 a little smile almost as
		 if he is pleased)
	I don't want to start no fight with
	you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full
	of shit?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor
	and Rose has been a good wife to
	him for a long time. To call her a
	nymphomaniac is the most stupid
	thing I ever heard in my life.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(again surprisingly mild)
	You loved her, didn't you. Well, so
	did I. 
		(a little shrug)
	You'll have to admit she had four
	husbands.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Yeah, it took her a while to grow
	up and find Mr. Right, but she did
	it. She found him.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(another little smile)
	She used to call me Mr. Right.
	Remember that, Buddy?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(he is pale with anger)
	Yeah, I remember it.

Willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Well, I tell you, I don't know what
	the world's come to these days.
	Things used to be better. We didn't
	have any money, but things were
	better. 
		(grimaces in anger)
	Goddamn niggers and kikes burning
	the flag, rioting, raising hell --
	they ought to shoot their asses
	off. I tell you, Buddy, where this
	country made its mistake was
	allowing people without property to
	vote.

During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says
nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave
shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..

INT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY

A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta
airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of
the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is
politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(holds out hand)
	Well, got to get a plane to
	Savannah. Great running into you,
	Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(sweating, tense, under
		 some kind of awful
		 emotional strain)
	Ah-h, if you happen to run into
	Rose sometime... do me a favor,
	give her a message for me, will
	you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a trifle wearily)
	Dave, I haven't seen Rose for
	years.

Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ
GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.
In desperation, Dave takes his arm.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a
	heart attack last year, I wasn't
	expected to live.

Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly
explains.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	You might see her. She writes your
	Daddy, and she and that doctor came
	to see him, didn't they? I wish
	you'd tell her something... I never
	could write letters.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in a different tone,
		 interested, curious)
	What do you want me to tell her,
	Dave?

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(a painful inward
		 struggle; the man is
		 tormented, miserable)
	Oh, to hell with it, never mind.
	Don't tell her anything. Don't even
	tell her you saw me. 
		(half turns his back, his
		 face twisted with strong
		 emotion)
	Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my
	plane.

Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after
Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer
seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half
to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	He still loves her. The poor damn
	fool still loves her.

			HERTZ GIRL 
	Who was she?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	A girl named Rose.
		(pulls himself back into
		 the world of reality)
	Still take R75 to Glenville?

			HERTZ GIRL 
	Yes, sir.

Willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.

INT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY

CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the

is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with
amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on
the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or
music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.
Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the
titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY

A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a
house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is
BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he
shades his eyes to look at something far away.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl
walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE
takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase
tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are
dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and
seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her
primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and
sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with
the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she
stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to
her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened
and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted
from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She
blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces
herself to walk on.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,
unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an
even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his
hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a
mannerism of his father's.
Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always
with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands
there, waiting.

EXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A
tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she
is nervous and frightened.

			ROSE 
	Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to
	live with you and your family.

Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,
Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another
little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the
steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.
He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his
expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

			ROSE (CONT'D)
	What's your name? What do they call
	you?

Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child
after all.

			BUDDY 
	Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.

			ROSE 
		(greatly reassured, a real
		 smile now)
	Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice
	name, I like it. I am real pleased
	to meet you. 
		(solemnly holds out her
		 hand, they shake)
	Hey, look, do you think you got a
	cold drink of ice water somewhere?

			BUDDY
	Sure. Let me take your suitcase.

A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little
twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are
not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes
boys and men.

			ROSE 
	You're sweet.

INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris
chair in her bedroom study.

MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly
eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a
Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment
Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history
books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She
is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a
bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room.
The CAMERA pulls back to include him.

			BUDDY 
	The new girl is here.

			MOTHER 
	Wonderful. What's she like,
	Brother? What is your impression of
	her?

			BUDDY 
	She talks a great deal and smiles a
	lot. She's very pretty, she has a
	real good figure. She's very
	girlish or womanish, if you know
	what I mean. She wouldn't hurt
	anybody, this girl. She couldn't.

Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as
perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.

			MOTHER 
	Your impression is very reassuring,
	Brother. Of course she's had
	troubles, poor thing, but I sensed
	that was that the girl was like and
	I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

			BUDDY 
	You mean confirmed, Mother. I
	didn't confirm it before. I would
	have had to confirm it previously,
	in order for it to be reconfirmed.

			MOTHER 
	All right, all right. Doll and
	Waski are upstairs taking their
	nap, you go get them and bring them
	down to the living room. Where is
	the girl?

			BUDDY 
	In the kitchen drinking all the ice
	water in Glenville. She walked out
	here, she didn't go by the hotel.

			MOTHER 
	Walked, in all that heat? It's a
	wonder she hasn't got sunstroke.
	I'll phone Daddy and you go get
	Doll Baby and Waski.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM

A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living
room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl
of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle,
very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own
children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than
offensive.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, this is Waski. His real name
	is Warren but we call him Waski. He
	doesn't like it much and I suppose
	someday we'll have to stop calling
	him that.

			WASKI
	You can stop it right now.

			MOTHER 
	When he was baby we called him "Wa
	Wa," a baby name, you know. You
	will find him a very good boy. His
	brother can be bad and so can his
	sister, but Waski is a very good
	boy. And as you can see he's
	beautiful.

			WASKI 
	Oh, Mother, cut it out.

			MOTHER 
		(serenely)
	There are plenty of girls who would
	give thousands of dollars to have
	your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty
	and that's all there is to it.
	Beauty is there and we have to
	recognize it. Now Rose, the little
	girl sitting across from you with
	the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She
	looks like an angel and she is an
	angel, but she can be a naughty
	angel sometimes, although her
	father won't believe it. Her real
	name is Frances, but we call her
	Dolly or Doll.

			DOLL 
	I don't like that, either, it's
	worse than Waski. I want to be
	called Fran.

			MOTHER 
	Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the
	redhaired boy you see sitting
	there, of course you have met him,
	he is my oldest son and my most
	brilliant child. All children have
	great creative powers, but I don't
	want to rattle on about my
	children, they say I brag too much
	about them, especially about
	Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?

Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is
staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.

			ROSE 
		(feebly)
	Oh, no, ma'am.

			MOTHER 
	Well, it's rather interesting about
	Brother, actually. I realized the
	remarkable thing he had when he was
	six weeks old. He looked at me and
	understood me, he knew exactly who
	I was. I know it sounds crazy but
	it's true. He's very remarkable, he
	was born for the ministry and could
	move millions, but he doesn't know
	that yet. I have to warn you about
	him, he can be very dangerous,
	there is an evil streak in him, a
	streak of pure sheer meanness. But
	at heart Brother is saintly and
	that is why he was born for the
	ministry even if he doesn't know
	it.

Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with
reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and
very, very gentle and kind.
Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her
long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in
speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.

The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips,
swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous.
Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine
VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer,
Buddy's father.

			DADDY'S VOICE 
	Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out
	of the girl going into the fourth
	dimension like that.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He
is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner
all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and
funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern
dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a
comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the
characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where
Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on
the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the
back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his
hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what
seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude
really is inscrutable.

			MOTHER 
	It isn't the fourth dimension. To
	you it's the fourth dimension,
	maybe, to me it's simply the truth.

			DADDY 
		(staring fiercely at Rose)
	Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud
	has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all
	assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un
	hmmm.

Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious
he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually
as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her
knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she
has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of
him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair
beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins
a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no
clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	Well, Rosebud, now you are here,
	darling, and I swear to God
	graceful as the capital letter S.
	You will adorn our house, Rosebud,
	you will give a glow and a shine to
	these old walls. If there's one
	thing I like to have around, it's a
	frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume
	Mrs. Hillyer and the children have
	introduced themselves and made your
	acquaintance, and so forth and so
	on?

Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on
him, a half whisper.

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

			DADDY 
	All right. Now as head of this
	household I have a couple of
	remarks to make. It is my dear
	wife's belief, which I accept
	although I do not totally grasp it,
	that to hire a person to do
	household work is a criminal
	practice. Therefore, you are here
	not as a servant, you are here as a
	friend, as a guest and hopefully as
	a member of this family. You will
	eat your meals with us, you will
	share life itself with us -- in
	love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in
	love and harmony. Do you understand
	me?

			ROSE
		(a half whisper)
	Yes, sir.

Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness
and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes
begin to well with tears.

			DADDY 
	Now, I know you've had some
	troubles in your life, those...
	scoundrels in Birmingham and so
	forth trying to... lead you astray.
	I hope you find a safe haven here,
	honey, I know you've had a hard
	time. Life can be cruel to a young
	girl all alone. We welcome you to
	our home, Rosebud, we all welcome
	you from the heart and hope you are
	happy here.

Rose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an
inaudible whisper.

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

INT. HILLYER HOME

VARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the
floor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work,
smiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she
is happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is
apparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new
home.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose is washing the dishes while the children finish
breakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a
slightly sly expression.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, who were those scoundrels in
	Birmingham?

			ROSE 
	Nobody.

			BUDDY 
	But who were they?

			ROSE 
	They were just bad men, that's all.

			BUDDY 
	In what sense were they bad?

			ROSE 
	Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no
	sense to it.

			BUDDY 
	Did they try to induce you to
	become a prostitute?

Rose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the
dishcloth.

			ROSE 
	I don't answer talk like that,
	Buddy. I just don't hear it, I turn
	my back and look away.

Rose turns her back on him.

			BUDDY 
	Was that what they tried to do? Was
	that why Daddy gave you the job, to
	save you from those scoundrels?

			ROSE 
	Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll
	say that. He's the best and most
	kind-hearted man in the world.

			BUDDY 
	Hey, Rose, did you hear about that
	terrible thing down in Cave
	Springs?

			ROSE 
	What terrible thing in Cave
	Springs?

			BUDDY 
	There was this old man that ate his
	niece.

Rose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips
together.

			ROSE 
	I didn't hear you. I didn't hear
	that.

			BUDDY 
	He really did, he ate his little
	niece. He made pork chops out of
	her.

			ROSE 
	I don't hear you. I just turn my
	back on that kind of talk and look
	away.

			BUDDY 
	Well, it's only the truth. There
	are horrible things in the world,
	Rose.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, you are in one of your evil
	moods, I don't want to talk to you.
	I'm going out and sweep the patio.

Rose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski.

			BUDDY 
	Rose is almost as sentimental as
	Mother. If there's one thing I
	can't stand it's sentimentality. In
	Chattanooga this man committed an
	almost perfect murder. He killed
	his wife with a black widow spider.

			DOLL 
	Oh, shut up, Buddy.

			WASKI 
	Yeah, shut up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer
house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and
crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The
CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,
Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the
patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down
curiously at her.

			ROSE 
	What are you studying now, Mrs.
	Hillyer?

			MOTHER 
	More history, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Are you going to get your degree
	soon?

			MOTHER 
	Well, I am working on my thesis.

			ROSE 
		(as she busily sweeps)
	It must be wonderful to be so
	smart. I don't see how you do it,
	reading all those books, learning
	all that stuff.

			MOTHER 
		(looks up, and gently)
	Rose, you work too hard. Why don't
	you go sit down somewhere and drink
	a Co-Cola?

			ROSE 
		(smiles, trusts and knows
		 Mother now, not at all
		 afraid of her)
	You're so sweet.

Rose again busily sweeps.

			MOTHER 
	Really, why don't you go sit down
	somewhere?

			ROSE 
	I like to work. I don't mind work.
	It's the least I can do after all
	you and Mr. Hillyer have done for
	me. 
		(stares worshipfully at
		 Mother)
	You're so sweet. There never was
	nobody like you.

			MOTHER 
		(gently)
	Well, you run on now.

			ROSE 
	Yes, Ma'am.

Exit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of
a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound
of an approaching CAR and she glances up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a slightly worn-out 1932 Model-A Ford as it
rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the
wheel.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has
his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio.

			DADDY 
	Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful
	day.

			MOTHER 
	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd
	work outside.

			DADDY 
	How goes it, darlin'?

			MOTHER 
	Slow, hon. But at least I can
	concentrate now that Rose is here.

			DADDY 
	What do you think of her, honey?

Mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her
notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and
hear from it a faint BUZZ.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	Turn up your hearing aid.

			MOTHER 
	What?

			DADDY 
	Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at
	me like a snake.

			MOTHER
		(adjusts hearing aid)
	Oh. Did you say something?

			DADDY 
	I asked you what you think of
	Rosebud, now that she's been here a
	while.

			MOTHER 
	Honey, she's perfect. She works all
	the time and she's wonderful with
	the children. And they love her,
	even Brother likes her though he
	won't admit it. I think she's just
	perfect.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

			MOTHER 
	And she's such a good-hearted
	thing, there isn't an ounce of harm
	or malice in her.

			DADDY 
	Well, I'll admit I don't see any
	flies on her yet.

			MOTHER 
	There are no flies on Rose, I don't
	know what you're talking about.

			DADDY 
	Well, she must have done something
	to encourage those scoundrels in
	Birmingham, even if she did run
	away from them.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the window of the kitchen. He is
propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the
talk on the patio. We hear the VOICES of his parents OVER the
shot.

			MOTHER'S VOICE 
	If you mean... boys and men, I
	don't think so. Rose seems very
	calm about all of that.

			DADDY'S VOICE 
	Well, so far I have to agree. She
	seems calm as lettuce.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he draws back into the kitchen.
We see Doll and Waski playing a game on the kitchen table.

			BUDDY 
	Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce.
	Do you believe that, Doll?

			DOLL 
	No.

			WASKI 
	Neither do I.

			BUDDY 
	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what
	we're talking about.

			WASKI
	I do, too.

Buddy turns, looks back out the window.

EXT. HILLYER SOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy on the patio. Daddy stands up.

			DADDY 
	Well, let's hope for the best,
	darlin'.

			MOTHER 
	Hope for the best? I don't
	understand all this skepticism. I
	thought you liked Rose.

			DADDY 
	I love Rosebud, I am wild about
	Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't
	turn out to be a hidden hotcha
	character, that's all. We have
	growing children in the house.

			MOTHER 
	Hotcha character. If I had to live
	with your cynicism, I wouldn't want
	to live at all. What you can't
	understand is that the creative
	forces of the universe are
	positive, not negative.

			DADDY
		(gently, his irony is
		 mild)
	All right, darlin', don't go off
	into the fourth dimension.

			MOTHER 
	I'm not in the fourth dimension --
		(points a finger at him)
	-- you are in the fourth dimension,
	when you allow skepticism and doubt
	to take control. As Blake said, if
	God had doubt the sun would go out.

			DADDY 
		(again gentle irony,
		 always courtly toward
		 her)
	Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I
	don't understand these deeper
	things the way you do.

			MOTHER 
		(reaches up, takes his
		 hand)
	Be nice to Rose. She's never had a
	real home.

			DADDY 
	You're a wonderful woman, darlin'.
	As long as you're around, I'm sure
	the sun wouldn't dare go out.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the kitchen.
Doll and Waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table.
Buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls
across the kitchen, hands in his khaki pants.

			BUDDY 
	It's pitiful. Neither one of them
	know.

			DOLL 
		(as she shakes dice)
	I think Daddy suspects.

			BUDDY 
	No, he doesn't. Not really.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he goes to the hall door,
carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose busy dusting hall furniture,
humming as she works. We hear on the track the SOUND of the
Model-A starting, and Rose freezes. Then, quickly, Rose
hurries down the hall toward the front door.

ON Buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. He
has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his face is
expressionless.

ANOTHER ANGLE, POV of Buddy but CLOSER on Rose at the end of
the hall. She is staring soulfully through the glass of the
front door as we hear the Model-A go down the driveway. Rose
lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. A lovesick
expression is on her face.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

ON Buddy, as he comes back into the kitchen sadly shaking his
head.

			BUDDY
	It's really pitiful. She's in bad
	shape.

			DOLL
	She's watching the car again?

			BUDDY
	Yeah.

			DOLL
	I get so irritated with Daddy. He's
	so dumb sometimes.

			WASKI
	Yeah, I know.

			BUDDY
	Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.

			WASKI
	I do, too!

			BUDDY
	All right, what do you know?

			WASKI
	Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

			DOLL
		(pauses, then solemnly)
	Well, don't tell Mother.

			WASKI
	Do you think I'm crazy?

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night.
Daddy is at the head of the table, Mother is at the other
end.

Buddy, Doll and Waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes,
hands washed and hair combed. Rose is serving, but a place is
set for her. She wears an attractive little apron and is
smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her.

			DADDY
	(in a good humor) 
	Rosebaby Blossom, these are the
	most delicious candied yams I ever
	ate! Why, they just melt in my
	mouth. And this fried chicken is
	fit for a king. How do you do it,
	Peachbird? What is the secret of
	your art, Plum Blossom, huh?

			ROSE
		(blushing, smiling)
	Oh, I don't know, I... I...

			DADDY 
	Rosebird Baby, you are the light of
	my life, darlin'. How did we ever
	get by without you?

			ROSE 
		(stares at him, stricken)
	I... I'll get the grits.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Rose as she exits, and STOPS on Buddy and
Doll. Buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his
gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. The CAMERA
MOVES on to Mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything
going on between Rose and Daddy.

			MOTHER 
	Rose does have a gift for cooking.
	She learns so fast, but mainly I
	think it's that she tries so hard.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is
seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her
food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly
unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the
children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a
biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

			MOTHER
		(gently, suspects
		 absolutely nothing)
	Rose, you're in an awful dither
	tonight. What's the matter with
	you, honey, are you sick or
	something?

			ROSE
		(in a feeble voice)
	No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

			MOTHER 
	You look sick if you ask me. I hate
	to leave you with the dishes and
	all, but I'm supposed to go to a
	meeting of the Garden Club this
	evening.
		(to Daddy)
	I'll need the car keys.

			DADDY 
	I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got
	no business behind the wheel of an
	automobile. You don't think about
	what you're doing and you'll run
	into a telephone pole.

			MOTHER 
	I think about what I'm doing all
	the time, and I've got as much
	business behind the wheel of an
	automobile as anybody. Besides, I
	want you to stay and help Rose with
	the dishes, the poor girl isn't
	feeling well.

			DADDY 
	All right, darlin'.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

A shot of Daddy alone in the dining room, reading a newspaper
and drinking coffee. Rose comes INTO THE PICTURE, gets dishes
as she clears the table. She stares with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is absorbed in paper.

			DADDY
		(to himself, mostly)
	Hmmp. Did you realize there are a
	thousand Coca-Cola millionaires in
	Atlanta?

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll tiptoeing down the darkened
hall toward the front door. We hear the MODEL-A going down
the drive. They peer out of the glass of the front door. They
whisper.

			BUDDY
	There goes Mother.

			DOLL
	Yeah.

			BUDDY 
	Let's go peep from the living room.

			DOLL
	Okay.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe into the darkened
living room. They go over to the sliding doors and silently
struggle for the best peeping spot. Buddy gets up high, Doll
down low, at the crack in the doors through which light
shines.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of the dining room, as seen by children.
Daddy sits absorbed in his paper, oblivious of Rose. She is
staring down at him with a pale look of love.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE-UP of Buddy and Doll, their heads together.
They whisper.

			DOLL
	I think she's gonna kiss him.

			BUDDY
	At least.

INT. HILLYER HOME DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as seen by children. The
table now is cleared and Rose stands half behind Daddy,
staring down at him with a stricken expression.

			DADDY 
		(half to himself)
	Ehh, Lord, should have bought that
	stock when we had some money. A
	thousand millionaires.

Rose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his
shoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm
around his neck.

			ROSE 
	Oh, oh! Oh, Mr. Hillyer, I love
	you, I love you so much! I've
	tried, but I can't help it! Please
	kiss me -- will you kiss me?

For a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half
frown as if he can't believe it. In order to stare at her, he
must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he
looks a bit like a startled rooster. Her breasts are pressed
against him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.

			DADDY 
		(finally clears his
		 throat)
	Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap.
	What are you doing, girl? Are you
	crazy?

			ROSE
	Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr.
	Hillyer!

			DADDY 
	Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you
	crazy girl. Now I'm telling you
	again, get off my lap. Come on,
	Rose, get up. Now you get up, I
	say, and stop this!

			ROSE 
	No, no! You don't understand, I
	love you! It's real love and I
	can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr.
	Hillyer, I love you, I love you so
	much...

Rose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder.
She has her arms wound tight around him and Daddy seems at a
loss what to do.

			DADDY
		(in a shaken voice)
	All right, all right. Now calm
	down, Rose, the children will hear
	you. Calm down, let's talk... about
	this thing, let's discuss it.

	They're discussing it.

			DOLL 
	I can't see, let me see...

Doll tries to rise up and Buddy puts a hand on her head and
shoves her down.

			BUDDY 
	This is my place and you can't have
	it.

			DOLL
		(a whispered moan of
		 frustration)
	Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?

	He's trying to get up -- good God,

	Let me see!

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as he struggles to rise
from the chair. They are half falling to the floor and now
they fall, Rose still on his lap. One of her breasts has come
out of her dress, which is very loose and low-cut. She has no
bra, the breast is bare. Daddy is staring groggily at the
breast as if slightly dazed.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO Buddy and Doll. Buddy is frustrated now.

			BUDDY 
	Now I can't see. What are they
	doing?

		 crack)
	Boy! Wow!

Buddy groans and peers intently through crack.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	What are they doing, Doll?

	He kissed her.

			BUDDY
	Is that all?

	He had his hand on her titty.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

DOWN LOW, we can see under the dining room table now. Daddy
has his hands on Rose's shoulders and is firmly pushing her
away.

			DADDY
	All right, that is enough of this
	nonsense, and I mean enough! Get up
	off this floor, Rose, and put your
	damned tit back in your dress! Do
	you hear me, girl, get up off of

Rose, on all fours, blonde hair over her face, making little
whimpering noises of dismay:

	Ohh-hhh... ohh...

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll.

			BUDDY

Doll forces her way in and they both peep through crack in
door.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose and Daddy. Rose stands sheepishly
by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her
dress. Daddy sits in his dining room chair. Daddy is glaring
at her.

	Goddamn you, girl! You've made me
	make a fool out of myself, damn
	your hide, but let me tell you I am
	standing at the pass of Thermopylae
	and I won't budge! The very idea,
	my own home with children in the
	house, to say nothing of my wife --
	oh-h, you had better believe I am
	standing at Thermopylae, you little
	nut, you had better believe it!
	What are you, crazy? A man is
	supposed to be a fool like this,
	but a woman is supposed to have
	some control and sense! Are you a
	nitwit? What's the matter with you?

			ROSE 
		(weeping)
	Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr.
	Hillyer... I just... couldn't help
	myself. I'm sorry...

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they peep at the door.
Doll whispers angrily at him.

			DOLL 
	Buddy, that was pretty snotty of
	you, pushing me away like that just
	when it was interesting.

			BUDDY 
	You shouldn't watch such things,
	Doll.

They continue to peep with interest through the crack in the
doors.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Daddy. Now Rose is sitting penitent
and crying in one of Daddy's handkerchiefs. Daddy's anger is
gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now
in a different tone.

He sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly
way.

			DADDY 
	Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor
	miserable little child, don't you
	know I love you? Do I have to put
	my hand on your body or kiss your
	pretty lips to prove it? You are
	beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved
	you since you first came here,
	darlin'. And don't you know Mrs.
	Hillyer loves you, too, that she's
	already taken you into her heart,
	and that that woman's heart is as
	wide as the blue sky itself and as
	deep as the stars?

			ROSE 
		(weeping in handkerchief)
	Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's
	been so good to me...

			DADDY 
	Do you know what a friend you have
	got there? Do you know she would
	fight for you like a tiger, that
	she would fly to your defense in an
	instant with all the courage in her
	soul if anyone tried to hurt you?
	Is this any way to repay her trust
	and love? Are you ashamed as I am
	ashamed? 
		(pauses as Rose sobs in
		 handkerchief)
	Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But
	let me warn you, damn your hide,
	this is Thermopylae and I am
	standing here. Do you hear me, damn
	you. I am standing at Thermopylae
	and the Persians shall not pass!
	Now get your tail out of here and
	go wash those dishes, and stop
	crying!

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

gestures that they'd better leave, and they do. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe out of the living room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STAIRS - NIGHT

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy and Doll as they tiptoe up the front
stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT

ON Buddy and Doll at the top of the stairs. They pause to
talk and now they don't have to whisper. Doll is happy,
pleased.

			DOLL 
	Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted
	to kiss her some more and play with
	her, but he didn't, because he
	loves Mother and all of us, and he
	loves Rose, too. Isn't he
	wonderful, isn't he great?

			BUDDY 
		(dryly, aloof; he doesn't
		 mean this really)
	Wonderful? He kissed her and played
	with her titty, and I don't see
	anything so great about that. He
	was probably afraid Mother would
	come back early and catch him.

			DOLL 
	You know, Buddy, sometimes you make
	me sick.

Doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. The CAMERA
STAYS on Buddy as he stares after her with a thin little
smile. Be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.
After a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of
downstairs and his face changes. His smile fades, then slowly
returns as he thinks of what has happened.

			BUDDY 
		(quietly, to himself)
	Thermopylae. The Persians shall not
	pass.

It is obvious that secretly Buddy admires very much his
father's behavior.

A shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.

He wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes
midway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is
finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old
fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He
looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his
bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a
small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.

CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall
title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND
DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers
Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the
shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a
glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing
maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth
going, "Tee-Hee!"

ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the
Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to
the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the
bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the
flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a
faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the
covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and
throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on
pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his
room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The
shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over
his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half
crying.

			ROSE 
	Buddy... are you asleep?

ANOTHER ANGLE, on both of them. Buddy stares at her in
surprise. It is dim in the room, but we can see them in the
moonlight.

			BUDDY
	No, I'm awake. What's the matter?

			ROSE 
	Buddy, I am wandering in a
	wilderness, lost. 
		(sits glumly on edge of
		 bed)
	I just feel awful. Do you mind if I
	get in bed with you for a little
	while?

			BUDDY 
	Well, all right.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed in the moonlight.
It is all innocent enough, Buddy is a child and Rose
obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. She
lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a
cigarette.

			ROSE 
	I thought I'd go crazy back there
	in that room all by myself with
	nobody to talk to. As a child, I
	never had no room all to myself, we
	were awful poor. Buddy... I have
	got a confession to make.

			BUDDY 
	What is it, Rose?

			ROSE 
	It's so terrible I can't tell you.
	Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it
	hurts to have a broken heart, what
	a terrible feeling it is, and I've
	had a broken heart so many times.
	Men, I don't understand them, I
	can't figure them out and they
	break my heart, that's all. I can't
	find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find
	him no matter how hard I look, all
	I find is a whole pile of Mr.
	Wrongs. But this is the worst ever
	because it wasn't his fault. It was
	my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was
	bad -- oh God, I was bad, you
	wouldn't believe how bad I was.

			BUDDY 
		(a little smile)
	What'd you do, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell
	you who it was, but do you know
	what I did? I sat on his lap and
	got ahold of him and wiggled and
	wiggled my ass on him and was
	worse'n you could know, a child
	like you. Why, I let one of my tits
	fall out deliberate on purpose and
	practically smack him in the face
	with it and I let my dern skirt
	come up so he could see my
	drawers... 
		(pauses, realizes this
		 isn't too dignified)
	But to get back serious to what I
	was sayin', it is not only, Buddy,
	the loss of him but my own bad
	behavior what bothers me so...

			BUDDY 
	You were pretty bad, huh?

			ROSE 
	Why, it has just made me ill,
	Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to
	eat nothin', I don't, and me I got
	a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral
	for me. I'm ill.

			BUDDY
		(slyly, pretends he
		 doesn't know)
	But, Rose, what is the cause of it
	all?

			ROSE
	Promise not to tell Doll? -- or
	nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm
	so much in love with him I am out
	of my mind!

			BUDDY
	But, Rose, how could such a thing
	as that happen?

			ROSE
	I fell madly in love with him when
	he called me Rosebud. You know that
	first day when I come and he said I
	looked graceful like a capital
	letter S and called me Rosebud? I
	fell madly in love with that man
	right then.
		(sighs tragically)
	But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a
	good man and won't have nothin' to
	do with me.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has
propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the
moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the
open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself
conscious with him.

			BUDDY 
		(casually)
	Can I touch you here?

Before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger
through her nightgown.

			BUDDY (CONT'D)
	Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

			ROSE 
		(casually, doesn't object)
	What did you expect?

			BUDDY 
	Well, I thought they were more like
	a cantaloupe.

			ROSE 
	Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a
	cantaloupe.

			BUDDY 
		(touches her breast more
		 boldly, his hand outside
		 the nightgown)
	There's some kind of gristle in it,
	though.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, quit that, you're just a
	child, you're not supposed to be
	interested in such things.

			BUDDY 
	Actually, I am, though.

			ROSE 
		(dreamily, thinking of
		 Daddy as she smokes
		 cigarette and stares up
		 at the ceiling)
	You know, that Daddy of yours is
	the funniest man, the things he
	says, you never know what's going
	to come out of his mouth next.

			BUDDY
	Can I put my hand inside your
	nightgown, Rose?

			ROSE 
	No, you can't. And I'll tell you
	this -- he scares me. As kind as he
	is, he scares me. You can't fool
	around with him, not with that man.
	And, boy, I sure better not try
	nothin' like that with him again,
	he'll fire me.

			BUDDY
	Rose, can't I see what the nipple
	on it is like?

			ROSE
		(frowns)
	Buddy, what's come over you? A
	child like you, askin' such things.

			BUDDY
	But I'm curious, Rose.

Puts his hand in her nightgown.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit
	it, get you hand away...

Takes his wrist.

			BUDDY 
	Just for a second. Please, Rose,
	what's the harm?

			ROSE 
		(gently)
	Buddy, you don't realize it but
	what you're doing isn't nice.

			BUDDY 
	Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see
	what the nipple on it is like.

			ROSE 
	You don' t need to know that. It's
	none of your business.

			BUDDY 
	Aw, be a good sport, Rose. 
		(sweetly, almost sugarily)
	You like me, don't you? I like you
	a lot.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We
see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly
out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in
the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in
the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet
talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in
her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on
Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.
Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

			ROSE 
	Well, are you satisfied now? Can we
	just lie and talk, huh?

			BUDDY 
	Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

			ROSE 
	'Course it does.

			BUDDY 
	First I couldn't feel it, but now I
	feel it easily, it's like a little
	acorn.

			ROSE 
		(moistens her lips,
		 swallows; it is affecting
		 her; she frowns)
	All right, that's enough. 
		(firmly pushes his hand
		 away)
	You're just a child and wouldn't
	understand it, but that type of
	thing can stir a girl up. Now lie
	back and we'll talk.

			BUDDY 
	That was very interesting. Thank
	you, Rose.

			ROSE 
		(lighting cigarette)
	Don't mention it.

			BUDDY
		(pensively, with the
		 solemn pedanticness of a
		 precocious child)
	It was softer'n I thought, that was
	my main impression. You know, if
	you hit a girl there it would hurt
	her a lot.

			ROSE 
	Who would want to do such a thing
	as that?

			BUDDY 
	Well, some fiend might.

			ROSE 
		(stares wonderingly at
		 him)
	You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't
	figure you out at all. You can be
	very nice, but like your mother
	said there's an evil streak in you.

			BUDDY 
	There's an evil streak in
	everybody, Rose.

			ROSE 
	There ain't none in your Daddy. You
	know, what happened has just made
	me love him all the more. I not
	only love him, I respect him, I
	admire him.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, I have a serious favor to ask
	you.

			ROSE 
	Most men wouldn't do what he done.
	If they can get a girl they go
	right ahead and get her -- I guess
	to hell they do, just like a dern
	rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell
	her she's no good when they done
	the same thing their selves.
	They're a bunch of monkeys. I like
	'em, but they're a bunch of
	monkeys.

			BUDDY 
		(trying to be casual)
	Rose, since you're here in bed with
	me and everything and I've already
	touched your titty...

Can't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we
don't hear what he says.

			ROSE 
		(her eyes open wide as he
		 whispers)
	Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What
	an awful thing to say, and where
	did you get any such idea as that,
	anyhow?

			BUDDY 
	I'm curious to see what it's like.
	I'm very curious, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Well, now that is just too bad!
	Curiosity killed the cat.

			BUDDY 
	Yeah, but satisfaction brought him
	back. Can I?

			ROSE 
	No! You ought to be ashamed of
	yourself astin' such a nasty things
	a child your age!

			BUDDY
	Can't I touch it a little, Rose --
	not a lot, just a little?

			ROSE 
	Of course you can't! I'm... I'm
	shocked at you, Buddy, real
	shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm
	going back to my own bed!

			BUDDY
	Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's
	all, I have a natural curiosity,
	it's only human. You're my friend,
	aren't you? Don't you like me? 
		(again sweetly, almost
		 sugarily)
	I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact,
	I love you.

			ROSE 
		(softens despite herself)
	Well, you're sweet, but you don't
	really love me.

			BUDDY 
	Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good
	sport.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, you're just a child.

			BUDDY 
	I'm thirteen. And I have a natural
	curiosity. It's only nature, Rose,
	that's all. Now what's wrong with
	nature, huh?

			ROSE 
	Well, nothin'.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in
pajamas. He looks frowzle-haired and glum. The CAMERA FOLLOWS
him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the
moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau. Be
glances over his shoulder as we hear Mother.

			MOTHER 
	What's the matter, hon? Is anything
	wrong?

			DADDY 
	No, darlin'. Just that damnable
	insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a
	baby for an hour then I'm wide
	awake. You go back to sleep.

Daddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares
out at the moonlit night.

The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER on his face and we see a weariness
and strain he has not shown before.

			DADDY 
	The Depression has got me. That
	miserable hotel, no money anywhere,
	strong men out of work, children
	hungry. It's a great life if you
	don't weaken.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has
weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can
only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders
and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A
different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she
is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely
haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble
voice.

			ROSE 
	You better quit that.

			BUDDY 
	But Rose...

			ROSE 
	I must be outta my mind. Buddy,
	quit it.

			BUDDY 
	Am I hurting you?

			ROSE 
		(pauses, stares off as if
		 listening, then in an
		 even feebler tone, a half
		 whisper)
	No. No, you're not hurting me. 
		(moistens her lips,
		 swallows)
	But I think you better quit it.

			BUDDY 
	But why, if I'm not hurting you?

			ROSE 
	You wouldn't understand.
		(puts a hand on his
		 shoulder as if to push
		 him away, but can't; puts
		 her other hand over her
		 eyes)
	Oh, God, I must be outta my mind.
	What would your Momma think?

The hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head
to the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there
as the boy fiddles with her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a
bathrobe and slippers. He looks very frowzled and sleepy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

ON Daddy as he walks into the kitchen, turns on the light. He
goes to the ice box, an old-fashioned type made of wood that
takes cakes of ice. Be pours out a glass of milk.

INT. HILLYER ROME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a very CLOSE SHOT on Rose's face. The light is dim but
we see perspiration on her forehead. Her breathing is not
normal. Her eyes are shut tight, her teeth are clenched.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy. We do not see what he is doing,
but evidently he is fiddling with her. He seems quite
interested in the proceedings.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, beyond a doubt this is the
	most fascinating experience of my
	life.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather
gloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass Of milk.

			DADDY 
		(to himself)
	Ehh-hh, Lord, man born of woman
	hath few days and they are full of
	trouble.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot close on Rose ai Buddy in the bed. The shot is
of their heads and shoulders.
She has an arm very tight around his shoulders and her eyes
are shut tight. The moment of truth is at hand.

			ROSE 
	Ohh-hh! Ohhh-hh! 
		(it's all over; she twists
		 sideways, puts both arms
		 around him)
	Oh, Buddy, you're so sweet. I love
	you a lot.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy as he washes out the glass in the
sink.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy in the bed. The extremity of
her crime has dawned on Rose and she is sitting up in the bed
with a look of horror on her face. Buddy is staring worriedly
at her.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, are you all right? Are you
	sick or something?

			ROSE 
		(staring off in space,
		 lost in horror)
	No. No, I'm all right. 
		(turns, stares at him,
		 puts a hand in woe on her
		 forehead)
	Oh, God, what have I done? I have
	robbed a cradle and fallen into
	hell!
		(fumbles desperately on
		 bed for cigarettes)
	I must be crazy, a child like you.
	Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful,
	this is terrible, I gotta get outta
	here!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out
of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward
the door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought
occurs to her.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,
	would you?

			BUDDY 
		(a trifle too piously)
	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a
	soul.

			ROSE 
	I sure hope you don't.
		(still in a panic)
	I gotta get outta here, good night.

			BUDDY 
		(sweetly)
	Good night, Rose.

INT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in
his bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the
upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks
and he looks up and sees her.

			DADDY 
	Rose, what are you doing up?

			ROSE 
	Nothin', just goin' to the
	bathroom.

			DADDY 
	Is anything wrong?

			ROSE 
	No, sir.

			DADDY 
	Well, good night.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for
her the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the
nightgown, she looks as if she might faint.

			ROSE 
	Good night.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the
hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom.
Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind
her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.
The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With
trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty
pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.
Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has
not turned on the light in her room and her considerable
charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.
Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own
reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible
realization.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is
blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The
shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy
and an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark
recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,
murky, cobwebby.

			BUDDY 
	Wait till you hear what happened!
	Now you wont believe this, Doll,
	but Rose came in my room and got in
	my bed last night...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his
child's face a sinister look. Now he has "Dracula" teeth and
evil arched eyebrows.

			BUDDY (CONT'D)
	... and she sweated and snorted
	like a horse and had a horrible
	fit, her eyebrows were all
	scrunched up and she groaned like
	she was eying and foamed at the
	mouth!

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose standing horrified before the mirror.
The match is still burning in her fingers.

							QUICK CUT TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY

A shot of Mother in her study, a worried Doll stands before
her. The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash
of fantasy.

			MOTHER 
	Yes, dear, what is it?

			DOLL 
	Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his
	bed last night and he fiddled with
	her and she snorted and had a fit --
	and he says I would too if I was
	grown-up. Is it true, Mother --
	would I sweat and snort and froth
	at the mouth and have a horrible
	fit like he says?

Mother stares in consternation at Doll.

							QUICK CUT TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

A shot of Daddy and Rose on the front porch of the house. The
scene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.
Daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down
the driveway. A weeping, slumped Rose sadly walks down the
steps carrying her cardboard suitcase. Fantasy.

			DADDY 
	Out! Out, you viper in the grass!
	Out! Never darken our doorstep, you
	immoral, terrible girl!

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Rose standing before the mirror, sick with
horror. A feeble whimper-like groan comes from her.

			ROSE
	Ohh-hh, ohhh-hh... 
		(match burns her fingers,
		 she shakes it out)
	Ouch! Oh-hh... ohh...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she turns from the bureau and stares
off into space, a very badly frightened girl. Half-crying,
she speaks to herself.

			ROSE (CONT'D)
	He'll tell 'em for sure, he will.
	Oh, Lord, what can I do?

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the
lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The
CAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing
by his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.

			ROSE 
	I hate to turn on this light, you
	Daddy's awake downstairs, but I
	have to take the chance.
		(sits by him on bed)
	Buddy, please don't tell on me.

			BUDDY
		(rather coolly)
	I said I wouldn't. 

			ROSE
		(her lip trembles)
	Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as
	I've been please have pity on me
	and don't ruin me by telling them
	what I did. I know it was bad, it
	was bad and dumb. But mostly it was
	dumb, I didn't mean you no harm,
	I'd never want to hurt a hair on
	your head and that's the truth. I
	love you. But they'd think I did,
	they'd think I was awful, they'd
	despise me and hate me...

Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose
weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's
heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it
yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool"
and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips,
swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene
with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at
Thermopylae, he shrugs.

			BUDDY 
	Well, I don't know what you're
	worried about. It was my idea, I
	was the one who thought of it, not
	you.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the
boy with hopeless despair.

			ROSE 
	You don't understand. They'd blame
	me, not you. And they'd think I was
	awful, a disgustin' girl, which I
	am, but Buddy, please don't tell
	them. Please don't. Ill have to go
	and I love it here, I love your
	whole fam'ly, your Daddy, your
	Mother... 
		(pauses, then makes her
		 final and ultimate plea
		 in a shaking voice as
		 tears run down)
	Buddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a
	bad girl but I can't help it,
	please have pity on me and don't
	tell! Please don't, please...

Too much for Buddy, he loses his "cool." He swallows and
blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and
squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy
style.

			BUDDY 
		(very solemnly)
	Rose, they could stick splinters
	under my fingernails, and I will
	never say a word! I will never tell
	them, because... I love you!

			ROSE 
		(sees that he means it,
		 smiles in relief and
		 throws her arms around
		 him)
	Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew
	you did, knew it all the time...

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, lying in bed and staring up
sleeplessly at the ceiling. Insomnia in reverse has got him.

			DADDY 
		(a half whisper to
		 himself)
	Ehh-hh, Lord... great life if you
	don't weaken.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy. Rose is sitting on the bed
beside him and she has dried her tears and got herself in
hand.

			ROSE 
	Well, Ill tell you this. I have
	learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't
	gonna run around, but when I start
	botherin' your Daddy and worse
	robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the
	facts of life. 
		(pauses, then with firm
		 resolution)
	Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get
	myself up and go out.

			BUDDY 
		(a wee mite puzzled)
	You're going to get yourself up and
	go out?

			ROSE 
	Buddy, Mr. Right is out there
	somewhere and I'm gonna find him!

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late
morning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a
sheepish Buddy standing "on the carpet before her. The other
children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table
having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with
schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.

			MOTHER 
	Brother, when I have to wake you up
	at eleven o'clock in the morning
	you're either sick or you were up
	very late last night. 
		(points a finger at him)
	And you weren't reading Huckleberry
	Finn. I looked and its not in your
	room. Now what were you doing?

			BUDDY 
		(sheepish)
	Mother, I have to tell the truth. I
	wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I
	was reading one of those Little
	Dirty Comic Books.

			MOTHER 
		(sadly)
	Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed
	in you. You mustn't look at those
	horrible things, they degrade the
	human image.

			BROTHER 
		(hangs head)
	They're filthy, Mother.

			MOTHER 
	Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the
	most beautiful things in life, the
	creative power of the universe is
	behind it.

			BROTHER 
	I know, Mother.

			MOTHER 
	But we must respect that power, we
	must be in awe of it.

			BROTHER 
	I am in awe of it, Mother.

			MOTHER 
	I don't think you are sufficiently
	in awe of it. Get the castor oil.

			BROTHER 
		(winces, as Doll and Waski
		 happily smile)
	Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.

			MOTHER
	This isn't punishment, I don't
	believe in punishment. It's for
	your health. Obviously you're sick
	if you can act like that.

As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil
and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling
Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He
makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a
tablespoon of castor oil.

			BUDDY
		(wanly)
	Mother, cant you make it calomel
	instead of castor oil?

			MOTHER
	This is for your own good. When you
	look at negative, destructive
	things like those little filthy
	comic books, you are sick. Here,
	take this.

			BUDDY
		(he is resigned, there's
		 no way out; he makes a
		 face, swallows the castor
		 oil)
	Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!

			MOTHER 
	Stop gagging like that and putting
	on a show, and swallow it. 

			BUDDY 
	Uhhh, gahdam stuff! 

			MOTHER 
	What did you say, Brother? 

			BUDDY 
	I said ahhh-dam stuff. 

			MOTHER
	No, you didn't say that, Brother.

			BUDDY 
	Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing
	aid isn't working right. I said
	ahhh-dam stuff.

			DOLL 
	No, Mother, he's lying...

			BUDDY
	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts

			WASKI
		(happily excited,
		 stammering)
	He did lie, and... and... and
	Mother, yesterday he stole money
	out of your pocketbook!

			BUDDY
	Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat,
	or Ill kill you!

			MOTHER
	Children, children! Be quiet, all
	of you! 
		(the children at once
		 simmer down)
	The vibrations in this house are
	strange today. Where's Rose,
	anyhow?

			BUDDY
	She's getting herself up to go out.

			MOTHER 
		(frowns, adjusts hearing
		 aid)
	What'd you say, Brother?

			BUDDY 
	She's getting herself up to go out.
	I think she's coming down the hall
	now.

			MOTHER
	Oh, yes, it's Thursday. 
		(glances around at sound
		 of an opening door)
	Hello, Rose, dear... 
		(her eyes open wide as she
		 stares at Rose,
		 disconcerted; now weakly)
	... my, you're... looking pretty...

CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is
quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink
rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in
some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most
remarkable thing of all.

The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin
material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could
be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the
least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white
sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white
material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her
breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material.
It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear
of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing
suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black
patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent
leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is
on her face.

			ROSE 
	How do you like my outfit? I made
	most of it myself.

Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP
Mother.

			MOTHER 
		(smiling, slightly aghast)
	Well, it's... very gay.

We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.

			BUDDY 
	Here comes Daddy.

			ROSE 
		(staring down admiringly
		 at the outfit)
	I have a knack for designing
	clothes. But I had to buy the shoes
	and the pocketbook.

			MOTHER 
		(makes up her mind to
		 defend Rose)
	Well, I think it's charming, Rose. 
		(tactfully)
	But don't you think... ah, the
	skirt is a little tight?

			ROSE 
	Oh, no, that's the style. It's
	meant to be clinging.

We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances
around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.

CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual,
he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw
hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he
is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.

			DADDY 
	Ye gods and little fishes. What
	have you done to yourself, Rose?

ON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of
attention.

			ROSE 
	Nothin'. I got myself up, that's
	all.

			DADDY 
	Got yourself up?

			ROSE 
	Yeah. I'm goin' out.

Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at
table.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest
	outfit I ever saw in my life. You
	walk down the street like that and
	they'll put you in jail, Rose.

			MOTHER 
	Why, they won't either. She looks
	pretty. And I wish you wouldn't
	pick on the poor girl all the time.
	Don't listen to him, Rose, you look
	pretty, even beautiful.

			ROSE 
		(smiles affectionately at
		 Mother)
	You're so sweet.

			DADDY 
	If you've got time before you go
	"out," get me a half-a-cup of
	coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a
	half-a-cup.

			ROSE 
	Why, sure, always got time to get
	you a half-a-cup, and one of these
	days I'm gonna get you a whole cup
	and see what happens.

			DADDY 
		(a growl, doesn't like
		 jokes about his foibles)
	Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole
	cup, my nerves can't stand the
	caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful
	insomnia in reverse last night. Lay
	there and sweated blood for hours.

			DOLL 
		(sweetly)
	Daddy, Buddy was up late last night
	reading little dirty comic books.
	Mother gave him a dose of castor
	oil and he cursed it, he took the
	Lords name in vain, then claimed he
	hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

			MOTHER 
	You mustn't be a tattletale, dear.
	You mustn't be Delilah-ish and
	Jezebel-ish toward your brother,
	dear.

			DOLL 
	I'm only trying to help him,
	Mother.

			BUDDY 
	Heh, what a hypocrite.

			MOTHER 
		(to Daddy)
	I do wish you'd speak to Brother.
	It's true he's been looking at
	those horrible little books again.

			DADDY 
		(stares sternly at Buddy)
	Lay off of that stuff, son. It
	upsets your mother.

			MOTHER 
		(genuinely worried)
	I'm serious. We forget he's just a
	child. I wish you'd speak to him.

			DADDY 
	I'll take him with me downtown. 
		(glances at Rose as she
		 comes with coffee)
	And you, too, Rose, if you want a
	ride.

			ROSE 
	Sure, love one. Here's your half-a
	cup of coffee.

Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt.
He slowly shakes his head.

			DADDY 
	That's a pretty stylish skirt,
	Rose. The only thing I don't
	understand is how did you ever get
	it on.

			ROSE 
		(happy, pleased by his
		 interest)
	Well, it has buttons.

Points to little buttons on right side of the skirt.

			DADDY 
	How can the buttons stand the
	pressure?

			ROSE 
	There are more on the other side.

Points to buttons on left side.

			DADDY 
	Turn around, darlin'.

Happy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round,
feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin
material. Daddy slowly shakes his head.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	They'll put her in jail. The damn
	little fool might as well be naked.

			MOTHER 
		(a wee mite worried)
	Well, it is a little tight. But it
	isn't as bad as all that. No one
	will notice unless they have such
	thoughts in the first place.

			DADDY 
	Who doesn't have such thoughts? 
		(glances at wristwatch)
	We'd better get going.

			MOTHER 
	You're not having lunch?

			DADDY 
	Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never
	eat, darlin', you know that. Not
	eating and reverse insomnia are my
	curses. Let's go, Rose, you and
	Brother, let's hit the road.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you and Brother wait in the
	car. I want to speak for a moment
	Lo Mr. Hillyer.

			ROSE 
	Yes, Ma'am.

			MOTHER 
	Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy as they walk out onto the
patio of the house. Rose walks down the steps to the flower
garden and Buddy follows.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose and Buddy as Rose picks a red rose and
puts it in her hair.'

			ROSE 
	Did your Momma really give you
	castor oil?

			BUDDY 
	Yeah.

			ROSE 
		(puts an arm around his
		 shoulders)
	You're my sweetheart.

INT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy at the kitchen table.

			MOTHER 
		(earnestly)
	I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose
	and tease her like that. Of course
	her clothes are silly, but she's
	ignorant, naive, she doesn't know
	any better.

			DADDY 
	The girl worries me. If she walks
	down the street like that, an army
	will be following her.

			MOTHER 
	Well, I admit that outfit isn't
	very modest. But she doesn't mean
	any harm, she just wants to
	attract, attention.

			DADDY 
	She will succeed.

			MOTHER 
	I don't think you understand her.
	It isn't sex she wants, it's love
	she wants and this is the only way
	she knows how to get it.

			DADDY
		(musingly)
	That farmer in Gadsden was awful
	eager to get rid of her, and I'm
	beginning to see why.

			MOTHER 
	He and his wife both said she had a
	fine moral character and was
	wonderful with children.

			DADDY 
	Well, she loves children, all
	right.
		(adds dryly)
	She loves everybody.

			MOTHER 
	But that's a wonderful quality, not
	a bad quality.
		(takes his hand)
	Have a little patience with her.
	She's such a good-hearted little
	thing and tries so hard.

			DADDY 
		(stares pensively at her)
	You are the one who's good-hearted.
		(rises)
	As for Rose, let's hope for the
	best.

			MOTHER
		(rises, again takes his
		 hand)
	Be kind to her. She loves you so
	much.
		(Daddy stiffens slightly,
		 and she adds)
	In a perfectly proper way, of
	course.

			DADDY
	Yes, of course.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy waiting in a Model A. Rose is
smiling, happy to be going out. The red rose is prominent in
her hair, Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, gets into the driver's
seat of the car, He glances in a wry manner at the flower in
her hair.

			DADDY 
	What have you got in your hair,
	girl?

			ROSE
	My rose. It's kind of like a motto.
	People will say, there comes Rose
	with her rose.

Daddy gives her another wry stare and starts the Model A.

			DADDY
	You were up late last night,
	Brother.

			BUDDY
	Well, a little.

			DADDY
	Reading dirty comic bocks.
		(glances shrewdly at him)
	And you admitted it?

			BUDDY
		(a trifle uncomfortable)
	Well, yeah.

Both Rose and Buddy begin to look increasingly tense.
Hawkshaw the Detective is on the scent. Daddy stares ahead.

			DADDY 
	You were up late last night, too,
	Rose.

			ROSE 
		(meekly)
	Yes, sir. I had to go to the
	bathroom.

A long pause, as Daddy stares ahead. His expression is
inscrutable.

			DADDY 
		(finally, "casually")
	Sometimes I think I was born to be
	a detective. I get a feeling about
	things. I'm not always right, but
	often I am.

			DADDY 
	Son, was Rose in your room last
	night?

			BUDDY 
		(scared, but a good liar)
	No. Why should Rose be in my room?

Daddy sternly scans them both. They stare back "innocently"
at him. Finally he seems to accept it.

			DADDY 
	I can't imagine why. It was just a
	thought.

Daddy shifts gears and faces front. Buddy glances upward in
relief, as if to say, "Wow, that was close."

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	Where do you want me to let you
	out, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Oh, anywhere downtown.

			DADDY 
	No reason at all, darlin'.

	Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing

			DADDY 
		(throws his napkin on
		 table)
	Rose, my patience is wearing thin.
	First a scruffy man who runs like a
	deer and now a sulky boy who wont
	go away. This is getting to be a
	regular monkey and dog show.

	don't know no boy like that, I

trifle scared.

	boy, but if you know anybody who
	does know him, if you have even a
	faint clue as to who he might be,

	ways, she's awful dumb.

			BUDDY 
		(takes off earphones,
		 gives it a moment of
		 grave consideration, then
		 his opinion)
	It isn't that she hasn't got any
	sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence
	is probably above average, maybe
	quite a bit above average.

			DOLL 
	Then why does she act so dumb?

			BUDDY 
	Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll.
	And neither does smartness. You see
	--

Buddy is interrupted by the SOUND of the distant angry shout
of a man's voice, evidently from somewhere outside in the
woods because Buddy and Doll turn at once toward the window.
In shock they listen.

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	You son of a bitch, what are you
	doing here?!

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	I'd like to ask you the same
	question, you bastard!

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	I told you to stay away from her,
	goddamn you!

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	You got no right to tell me to stay
	away from her, I knew her before
	you did!

			BUDDY 
	Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh boy. Daddy
	isn't going to like this.

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	She told you to leave her alone,
	didn't she?

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	Like hell she did! You're the one
	she wants to get shed of!

			BUDDY 
	Come on!

He and Doll hurry from the room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND STAIRS - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll running down the upstairs
hall and down the stairs. The CAM M FOLLOWS them down the
stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they slow down and creep
cautiously down the back hall to the back porch. We hear the
men yelling somewhere out in the dark bushes.

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	You'll swallow teeth yourself if
	you don't leave her alone, you ugly
	bastard! Go on, throw one, throw
	one!

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	I'll throw one, you son of a bitch!

We hear a great CRASHING in the bushes, a SMACK of a fist, a
GROAN of shock, an OATH, a SHOUT, more CRASHING.

EXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot from the POV of the children, on Daddy on the
back porch as the lights blaze on. He wears his bathrobe and
has a big shotgun in his hands. Now he speaks in a loud,
clear and very angry voice.

			DADDY 
	All right, I have got a Parker
	shotgun here and it is loaded and
	the trigger is cocked and wherever
	you birds are and whatever you are
	doing you had better get the hell
	out of here goddamned quick!

A sudden total silence ensues, then a sudden CRASHING in the
bushes as the "birds" take off.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	And do not come back, you sons of
	bitches! Stay away from my house
	and home and my wife and children
	or I'll blow your goddamned heads
	off!

INT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they cower in awe in the
downstairs hall. Daddy walks up to them carrying the shotgun.
He is grim and furious, but his voice is surprisingly calm.

			DADDY 
	You children go to bed. And
	Brother, stay away from Rose, I'll
	speak to her in the morning.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll in the upstairs hall. Doll
meekly goes to her room.
Buddy hesitates, looks at Rose's door, glances nervously back
at the stairs, then goes to Rose's door, knocks softly, opens
it.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose as he stands in the doorway
of her room. Rose is sitting on the edge of her bed in her
nightgown, a damp cloth held against her jaw which seems a
little swollen. A look of fear and guilt is on her face.

			ROSE 
		(rather feebly, as if it
		 explains something)
	I got an awful toothache.

			BUDDY 
		(quietly)
	Rose, if you don't keep your
	boyfriends away from the house,
	Daddy is going to fire you.

			ROSE 
		(innocently)
	But I don't know who they are.

Buddy makes an exasperated grimace and exits, shutting door.
The CAMERA REMAINS on Rose as she rolls her eyes upward in
dismay.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The
silence is deafening. Everyone looks depressed except Daddy,
who is aloofly calm. Rose's head is bowed meekly over her
plate as we hear the CLATTER of silverware. Finally, Daddy
speaks in an almost pleasant tone.

			DADDY 
	Well, Rose, my sleep was a little
	disturbed last night, and so was
	Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the
	children's. How about you? Was your
	sleep disturbed, too?

			ROSE 
		(solemnly)
	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I
	heard strange voices in the night.

			DADDY 
		(softly strumming fingers,
		 finally)
	Strange voices, Rose?

			ROSE 
		(innocent as an angel)
	Yes, sir.

			DADDY 
		(still aloofly polite)
	Now Rose, stop behaving as if
	you're Bo Peep. Those men had a
	flight last night because of some
	female in this house, and it wasn't
	Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.

			MOTHER 
		(very tense)
	I don't think we ought to discuss
	this in front of the children.

			ROSE
		(weeping, a hand over her
		 eyes)
	Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe...
	one of 'em... was Foster... but I
	don't hardly know him!

			DADDY
	Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth
	and quit crying!

			MOTHER
		(draws herself up)
	I will not sit here and listen to
	you be brutal to this poor girl.

			DADDY
	I am not being brutal to her!

			MOTHER
	You certainly are! She has an awful
	toothache, look at her jaw, it's
	all swollen.

			DADDY
		(trying to restrain
		 himself, aloofly polite
		 to the utmost)
	Darlin', it is not my fault if the
	girl has epizootics --

-- The word means "an animal epidemic," and it's a pet word
of Daddy's; he pronounces it epi-zoo-tics, not epi-zoo-ot
tics, and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady --

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	-- I am not responsible for her
	epizootics and I did not bring
	about her epizootics. Now listen to
	me. When I have to get up in the
	middle of the night and defend my
	home with a shotgun against a
	couple of damned scoundrels
	fistfighting in the bushes --

			MOTHER
	Scoundrels? They weren't
	scoundrels, they were just boys.

			DADDY 
	Boys? You say to me boys?

			MOTHER
	Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they
	were boys! Boy friends of Rose,
	chat's what they were, and why
	shouldn't she have boy friends? Do
	you want her to be unnatural? Don't
	you think she's human the same way
	you are yourself? It's the South,
	that's what it is, the South with
	its horrible traditions, of slavery
	and crime and the oppression of
	women, who are just as good as men
	and just as human!

			DADDY 
		(his eyes are a trifle
		 glazed)
	Now darlin', what has the South got
	to do with this?

			MOTHER 
		(in a real snit, afraid he
		 will fire Rose)
	And when I try to talk to you
	seriously, when I try to explain to
	you the unlimited creative power of
	life, how beautiful it would be if
	we gave up this hopeless struggle
	and simply loved each other from
	our hearts, what do you do -- you
	mock me!

			DADDY 
		(mildly, his eyes are even
		 more glazed)
	I don't intend to mock you, dear. I
	respect your philosophy. It's
	beyond my comprehension, but I
	respect it.

			ROSE
		(head bowed, weeping in a
		 little handkerchief)
	Ohhh-hh, ohhh...

			DADDY 
		(exasperated)
	Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your
	cornflakes!

			ROSE 
		(piteously)
	I'm not hungry.

The word is hongry, not hungry.

			DADDY 
	Now you listen to me, Rose --

			MOTHER 
		(with fire in her eyes)
	Just a moment! You are not going to
	fire this girl for an innocent
	thing like having boy friends, not
	while there is breath in my body!

			DADDY 
	I don't intend to fire her,
	darlin'.

			MOTHER 
	It isn't her fault if she's
	popular... what?

			DADDY 
	I said I don't intend to fire her.
	I just want to ask her to keep her
	boy friends away from my home and
	hearth, that's all.

			MOTHER 
		(simmers down at once, now
		 calmly)
	Well, that's very reasonable. Howe
	I hate to bring it up, but she's
	got an awful toothache, we've got
	to carry her to the dentist.

			ROSE 
	I don't want to go to the dentist.

			MOTHER 
	Be quiet, Rose.

			DADDY 
	Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the
	hotel. You and Brother can handle
	the girl's epizootics. I'll just
	say one more thing. 
		(turns to Rose and, in a
		 grave tone)
	Rose, I told you you had a friend
	in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she
	would fight for you like a tiger?

			ROSE 
		(meekly)
	Yes, sir.

			DADDY 
	All right, thanks to her, and
	thanks to this case of epizootics,
	you are getting another chance. 
		(points a finger at her,
		 and sternly)
	But don't try my patience again. We
	have growing children in this
	house. Do you understand me?

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Mother, Rose and Buddy in a dentist's
waiting room. Rose is holding a rubber ice bag to her jaw,
which is quite swollen. She is groaning and half weeping in
pain.

			MOTHER
	Poor thing. Does the ice help,
	Rose?

			ROSE
	Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't
	never been to no dentist before.
	He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

			MOTHER
	No, Rose, he'll help you.

ANOTHER ANGLE, Rose shrinks in fear as, enter the dentist in
a white coat, DR. WINTON, a kindly-looking, gray-haired man.
We see a nurse behind him. He smiles in a reassuring manner.

			DR. WINTON 
	Nurse says we have a nervous
	patient. Now, young lady, be calm.
	First of all, let me tell you, I am
	not going to hurt you.

			ROSE 
	Yes, you are.

			DR. WINTON 
	No, I am not.

			ROSE 
	Look, you can't kid me.

			MOTHER 
		(rises, takes her by the
		 hand)
	Now, come on, Rose. Stop being so
	childish, come on.

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Mother and Dr. Winton, as they
guide and lead Rose into the dentist's operating room.- She
plants her feet and her eyes open wide with horror as she
sees the chair and other equipment.

			ROSE 
	I'm not goin' in there, I don't
	like the looks of it!

			MOTHER 
		(annoyed)
	Rose, sit down in that chair and be
	quiet! We're trying to help you,
	you silly creature, sit in that
	chair!

			ROSE 
		(very reluctantly sits in
		 chair)
	Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna
	kill me.

			DR. WINTON 
	You and the boy wait outside.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Mother and Buddy in the waiting room. Enter
Dr. Winton with a little frown.

			DR. WINTON 
	Well, she finally let me look in
	her mouth. Is it true she's never
	been to a dentist?

			MOTHER 
	She was raised on a poor dirt farm.
	I'm sure she's never seen a dentist
	or hardly even a doctor.

			DR. WINTON 
	Well, she has one mouth in ten
	thousand, I don't see teeth like
	that once in ten years. Her trouble
	is an impacted wisdom tooth, but
	there isn't a cavity in her head,
	not a single one. She has perfect
	teeth.

			MOTHER 
	But the wisdom tooth will have to
	be pulled?

			DR. WINTON 
	Yes, and it's very bad. It probably
	should be done at the hospital
	under general anesthesia.

			MOTHER 
	That would scare her to death.
	She's terrified of hospitals. To
	her, a hospital is where you go to
	die.

			DR. WINTON 
	I think you're right, it would be
	harder on her. But you'd better
	call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to
	need help to get home.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A shot of Daddy behind the wheel of the model-A. Rose lies
pale and exhausted on Mother's shoulder on the front seat. A
trace of bloody gauze can be seen in her mouth and her eyes
are closed. Buddy is on the back seat.

			ROSE
		(a whisper, muffled by the
		 bloody gauze)
	Never again, never again...

			MOTHER
		(with pity, gently)
	I know it was bad, honey. I'm
	sorry...

			ROSE 
	No more dentists, no more
	dentists...

			MOTHER 
	It'll get better now.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model-A in the driveway of the Hillyer
home. Mother helps Rose out of the car, but Rose can't stand
on her feet. Daddy has to catch her from falling. Daddy picks
her up in his arms and carries her up the steps as Buddy runs
ahead to open the front door.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HILLYER PATIO - DAY

A shot of Mother and Daddy and Buddy on the patio. It is a
beautiful sunny morning. Mother and Daddy are seated at an
outdoor table about to have coffee. Daddy is opening mail and
Buddy, in the b.g., is gluing up a kite. Enter a smiling and
healthy Rose with orange juice, toast, cups and coffee on a
tray.

			DADDY 
	Good morning, Rose. And how do you
	feel today?

			ROSE 
	Wonderful. Except I can touch the
	place back there with my tongue, I
	wouldn't even know I had that tooth
	pulled.

			DADDY 
		(dryly, as he looks at
		 mail)
	Well, I know it, I just got the
	bill for it.

			ROSE 
	Boy, for four or five days there I
	didn't think I'd live. But I'm my
	old self again!

			DADDY 
	Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange
	voices in the night, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Oh, no, sir.

			MOTHER 
	Rose has learned her lesson,
	haven't you, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Yes, ma'am.

INT. HOTEL - MEZZANINE - DAY

A shot of Daddy peering down at an old pool table in the
mezzanine of the family hotel. Buddy stands by with a pool
stick in hand. In the b.g., we see a black bellboy, SHADRACH,
approaching.

			DADDY 
	I see my mother-in-law's face, son.
	Read 'em and weep, boy, I am
	playing a spectacular combination,
	a triple. The nine ball in the
	corner! 
		(takes his stance with cue
		 as Shadrach walks up)
	Read 'em and weep, boy, that's all
	she wrote.

			SHADRACH 
	Mistah Hillyer, the Chief of Police
	wants you on the telephone.

			DADDY 
		(about to make his shot,
		 looks around)
	The Chief of Police?

			SHADRACH 
	Yassuh.

Daddy straightens up, sets his jaw, leans the cue against the
table and marches toward the elevator as Buddy stares after
him. The CAMERA STAYS on Buddy.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy going down the hotel stairs. He holds
onto the banister, sliding with his hands far ahead in order
to take four and even five steps at a time -- it is a
childish trick, the point of the game is to touch as few
stairs as possible.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy as he jumps down the last remaining
five steps and walks into the lobby. Daddy comes from behind
the desk, grim.

			DADDY 
	Rose is in jail. She bit a
	policeman's thumb. Come on, son,
	Shadrach can run the hotel.

EXT. MODEL-A - STREET - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the Model-A. Daddy stares
grimly ahead. Buddy steals a worried glance at him.

INT. LOCAL JAIL - DAY

CUT TO a shot in the local jail. The shot is on Daddy as he
stands before jail bars staring sternly into a cell. His
hands are on his hips, his straw hat is on the back of his
head and a bit to one side. Buddy stands beside him, a little
bit behind, a worried look on his face. The CHIEF OF POLICE,
a fat man, is on the other side of Daddy.

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose in the cell. Her hair is mussed,
her dress is torn. A little innocent, frightened smile is on
her face. The CAMERA PANS to include Daddy and the Chief of
Police.

			CHIEF OF POLICE 
	That was a awful brawl down at the
	Busy Beaver, Mr. Hillyer. You know
	that fat Horton, the bootlegger?

			DADDY 
	Yes, I know the son of a bitch.

			CHIEF OF POLICE 
	Son of a bitch is right, he dern
	near killed a man. And this girl
	was the cause of it all. What's
	more, she bit a police officer's
	thumb right to the bone.

			DADDY 
	Well, Rose, what have you got to
	say for yourself?

			ROSE 
		(coughs, then feebly)
	I got an awful bad cold.

			DADDY 
		(nods slowly, then with
		 aloof politeness)
	That's all you've got to say,
	you've got a bad cold?

			ROSE 
		(coughs again)
	Well, I don't know what happened.
	They were arguin' about baseball,
	then all of 'em started fightin'.
	As for that policeman, I didn't
	bite him, I don't think I bit him.

In dour silence, Daddy and the Chief of Police stare at Rose.
She gives them a little smile, as if to say, "See how
innocent I am?" The Chief turns to Daddy and asks with dry
irony:

			CHIEF OF POLICE 
	Well, she's your girl, Mr. Hillyer.
	You want me to release her in your
	custody?

			DADDY 
	No, not really. But I guess we'll
	have to do that, John. Let her out.
	Let the crazy creature out and I'll
	take her home.

INT./EXT. MODEL-A - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the Model A. Daddy
stares grimly ahead, silent. Buddy looks solemn. Rose is
badly frightened and still coughing. Finally she ventures a
little smile and speaks to Daddy.

			ROSE 
	I got an awful cold, I think I'm
	sick.

Daddy is silent, his eyes fixed ahead.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it turns onto the Hillyer
driveway.

INT./EXT. MODEL A

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. She tries
again.

			ROSE 
	I didn't mean to bite him. He was
	hitting Horton with a blackjack in
	the meanest way and... and I bit
	him accidental.

			DADDY 
		(stops the car, turns to
		 Rose)
	I have to go back to the hotel. I'm
	on duty at the desk and who knows a
	quest might arrive. I will see you
	at suppertime, Rose.

			ROSE 
		(a feeble smile)
	I didn't mean to bite him, I really
	didn't.

			DADDY 
	I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

			ROSE 
		(feebly)
	Yes, air.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a shaky, slumped Rose going up the steps
with Buddy as the Model A drives away. Rose is coughing,
looks miserable.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of Buddy and Doll in the living room of the Hillyer
home at night. Doll is half-heartedly practicing scales on
the piano and Buddy is pacing the floor, hands clasped behind
him in something like the style of his father. As the CAMERA
FOLLOWS Buddy in his pacing we see Waski playing with marbles
on the floor.

			DOLL 
		(turns around on piano
		 stool, to Buddy)
	What is Rose going to do? Where can
	she go?

			BUDDY 
	They've been in there the longest
	kind of time. I can't stand it, I
	gotta find out what's going on.

			DOLL 
	You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill
	you!

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy coming with great furtiveness from the
living room out into the front hall. Very cautiously, he
tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door
of his mother's bedroom-study. He crouches down, peeps
through the keyhole.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY - NIGHT

CUT TO a "keyhole shot" of Daddy and Mother in the bedroom.
Mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes.
Daddy sits in a chair nearby. He looks depressed.

			DADDY 
	I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as
	much as you do.

			MOTHER
		(wanly)
	Well, she does seem to cause a lot
	of trouble, I admit. But she
	doesn't mean any harm and it'll
	break the children's hearts, they
	all love her.

			DADDY 
	It's because of the children she's
	got to go. I don't want to be
	holier-than-thou, but the girl
	doesn't have the same outlook we
	do. Morals don't mean a thing to
	her, not a thing, and we can't have
	a girl like that in this house.

			MOTHER 
	Who is to say our morals are better
	than hers?
		(frowns, sighs)
	But maybe you're right. She
	could... influence Dolly...

			DADDY 
	That is exactly what I'm afraid of. 
		(pauses, and firmly)
	The girl has got to go, darlin'.

			MOTHER 
	But morals come from the heart, not
	from rigid rules and empty laws.
	And in her heart Rose has never
	hurt anyone and she never would.
	Therefore, she's not immoral. Not
	really.

			DADDY 
	Now look, darlin', this is no time
	to go off into the fourth
	dimension.

			MOTHER 
	But what I said is the simple
	truth. And now I see something
	else, I see more deeply into it...

Mother has a slightly "other-worldly" look on her face. Daddy
glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something.

			DADDY 
	Just a moment, darlin'.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy crouched at the keyhole. With great
alacrity, he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts
the living room door just as Daddy whisks open the bedroom
door. Daddy grimaces.

			DADDY 
	Could of sworn that boy was out
	here.

Daddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of
a ballet Buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to
the keyhole.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a Shot of Daddy and Mother. It is another "keyhole
shot."

			MOTHER 
	How could Rose really be a bad
	influence on Dolly? She has a
	loving nature, you ought to want
	someone like that around your
	children. Why do you think those
	boys and men like her?

			DADDY
	Well, I have a pretty good idea.

			MOTHER 
	If you mean sex, you couldn't be
	more wrong. Rose likes those boys
	and men, she has love in her heart,
	and that is what they want. It's
	the most rare and beautiful thing
	in life and that is why they follow
	her.

			DADDY 
	They follow her because she's a -- 
		(he is about to say "piece
		 of tail," but interrupts
		 himself)
	-- no, I won't say that.

			MOTHER 
	What she doesn't understand is that
	her behavior is disturbing to other
	people. She's young, she's got to
	learn to restrain the life force
	that's in her. Its creative, but in
	her case it's too creative.

			DADDY 
	Darlin', Rose has got to go!

			MOTHER 
		(rises)
	I'll talk to her, I'll reason with
	her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the hall. He jumps up and hurries
across the hall into the living room. Again, as the living
room door shuts the bedroom door opens. Mother starts up the
stairs, her mouth determined.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the living room.

			DOLL
	What's happening?

			BUDDY 
	Mother is struggling desperately.
	In fact she's fighting like a
	tiger. But I don't know, it's
	close, it's mighty close.

			DOLL 
		(pauses, then in a low
		 tone, slightly wide-eyed)
	Buddy... does Rose really... "do
	it" with all those boys and men?

			BUDDY 
		(aloofly, like Daddy)
	Doll, don't ask childish questions.

			WASKI 
		(indignantly, to Doll)
	Of course not!

			BUDDY 
	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what
	we're talking about.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother going down the upstairs hall. She
knocks on Roses door and enters.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother as she walks over and stares down in
shock at Rose on the bad. Rose is lying back on a pillow and
staring groggily at her, obviously not quite all there.
Frowning with worry, Mother sits beside her and puts a hand
on her forehead.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you're very sick. You're
	burning up. Rose, can you hear me?
	Rose?

			ROSE 
		(semi-delirious)
	What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?

EXT. HILLYER SOME - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of an ambulance pulling up outside the Hillyer
house. Attendants get out of it carrying a stretcher.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front hall.
They are badly frightened, even terrified.
The CAMERA PANS to show the ambulance attendants carrying
Rose strapped in a stretcher down the stairs, as Mother helps
and Daddy follows, both of them very worried. Rose is
conscious now and her eyes roll with terror toward the
children.

			ROSE 
	Buddy! Dolly! They're takin' me to
	the hospital! Don't let 'em, don't
	let 'em!

The CAMERA STAYS on the frightened silent children as they
stare after Rose on the stretcher.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the
corridor of a hospital. All look very solemn. A nurse leads
them to a door and opens it.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of a hospital room. A very pale, sick-looking
Rose lies in a hospital bed. The nurse, mother, Daddy, Buddy,
Doll and Waski enter, all of them looking very grave.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE ON Rose as she weakly turns her head on
the pillow. Her eyes well with tears as she recognizes the
children.

			ROSE
		(a feeble whisper)
	Pray for me...

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the nurse as she speaks in a whisper we
don't hear to Mother and Daddy, obviously telling them they'd
better go. Daddy beckons to the children and they start to
leave, all looking depressed.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of DR. F. ROBERT MARTINSON, a rather unpleasant
man with a spade beard. He has a superior, patronizing way of
talking and very little Southern accent if any. The scene is
his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.

As he speaks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Daddy, Mother and
the Hillyer children.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is
	strong as an ox and that is what is
	keeping her alive. But not many
	people walk away from double
	pneumonia, Madam, not many.

			MOTHER 
	She looks terrible, just awful.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Of course she does and I must say
	I'm puzzled by your delay in
	getting her to the hospital. I
	should think ordinary powers of
	observation would have suggested to
	you that she was seriously ill.

			MOTHER 
	She hid it from us, Doctor. She's
	afraid of the hospital.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(a thin superior smile)
	Afraid of the hospital?

			MOTHER 
	Deathly afraid of it. Her people
	were poor tenant farmers and she
	doesn't know anything about doctors
	or medicine or hospitals.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(frowns in open disbelief)
	A tenant farm? Are you trying to
	tell me that girl is a product of
	the hookworm and pellagra belt?

			MOTHER 
	Well, her people were very poor.
	She says she was often hungry as a
	child, and I'm sure the food she
	ate was pretty awful, not a
	balanced diet at all.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Exactly, and that's why she
	couldn't possibly have come from
	such a farm.

			DADDY 
		(icily polite)
	Excuse me, sir, are you calling my
	wife a liar?

			MOTHER 
		(embarrassed)
	Honey, please...

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(a thin unpleasant smile)
	It's simply that I find it
	incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from
	the girl's illness at the moment,
	she is very strong, a very healthy
	specimen of a young human female --
	and a comely one, too. She must
	have gotten protein somewhere as a
	young child, if only sporadically.

			MOTHER 
	It is kind of amazing. The dentist
	says she has perfect teeth, there
	isn't a cavity in her mouth.

			MR. MARTINSON 
		(tries to make a
		 supercilious joke)
	Her entire mouth is a cavity,
	Madam, ha ha ha.

			DADDY 
		(dryly, doesn't like the
		 man a bit)
	Ha ha ha ha.

Mother frowns at Daddy and Dr. Martinson gives him an aloof
glance.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(with spurious dignity)
	The point is you don't grow up like
	that on a diet of sorghum and
	hominy grits. She got protein
	somewhere, she's a very strong girl
	and I think she'll live... despite
	the delay in medical treatment.

			DADDY 
	That's all I want to know. 
		(rises)
	Lets get out of here before I get
	the epizootics myself. Thank you,
	Doctor, for your discourse, it was
	fascinating, no doubt.

			MOTHER 
	Yes, thank you, Doctor.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(as they leave)
	I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do
	you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an
	animal epidemic?

			DADDY 
		(icily polite, from the
		 door)
	No, I mean epizootics.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski as
Daddy comes out of the Doctor's office and shuts the door.

			DADDY 
	I can't stand that polecat. They
	ought to hang him.

			MOTHER 
	You don't like him because he's a
	Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.

			DADDY 
	He's a polecat, dear.

INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Mother and the Hillyer children in a
hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them
down. Daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring
pensively ahead.

			DADDY
	Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in
	that bed. 
		(sighs, shakes his head)
	I hope she'll be all right, but I
	still think we ought to fire her.

			MOTHER 
	I don't see how you can even think
	of it now.

Daddy purses his lips but says nothing. It is obvious the
"epizootics" have saved Rose, at least for the time being.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of Rose in bed in her own bedroom. She is propped up
on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk
housecoat of Mother's.
A tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as Buddy
sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather
listening to her. It is obvious she is well on the road back
to health.

			ROSE 
	Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside,
	and so unhappy with that rich wife
	who doesn't understand him, her
	being a Southerner and everything,
	and what a bedside manner he has
	got -- so gentle and kind beneath
	the professor way he acts!

			BUDDY 
	Rose, you are too uncritical of
	people.

			ROSE 
	You don't know the bedside manner
	that man has got. Why, it does me
	good just to see him sit there all
	solemn and go pokin' in his bag
	like he's gonna cure me, which he
	did of course. And even more
	important he loves me, like a
	patient I mean, the other day he
	got tears in his eyes just
	listenin' to my heart beat.

			BUDDY 
	He did?

			ROSE 
	Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw
	'em, and a little bit he says to
	me, "You know, you are beautiful."
	Now wasn't that a nice thing for a
	doctor to say to a patient, wasn't
	it? What could cheer a girl up
	more?

			BUDDY 
	Rose, I have got doubts about that
	doctor and so does Daddy.

			ROSE 
	He's got doubts about hisself and
	that's the saddest thing of all.
	Would you believe that poor man
	thinks nobody likes him?

			BUDDY 
	Yeah, I'd believe it.

			ROSE 
	Well, I like him. I used to be
	afraid of doctors but not any more.
	Why, he could operate on me any old
	time and I wouldn't even be scared.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, you are just entirely too
	uncritical of people.

			ROSE 
	I ain't neither. Listen here,
	Buddy, besides all his vast medical
	knowledge, he has the most kindest
	heart beneath the professor way he
	acts -- he wants justice in the
	world and he's got some real
	interestin' ideas.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother opening the front door. Dr. Martinson
is there-with his black bag, an icy polite look on his face.;

			MOTHER 
	Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a
	lot better, I just gave her her
	supper. She's almost all well now.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Let me be the judge of that, Madam.

			MOTHER 
	Yes. Well. She's upstairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in Rose's bedroom.

			ROSE 
	Justice, that's what he wants,
	justice for everybody and
	especially for niggers. And I think
	that's real nice of him because
	black people don't have a very good
	life, you got to admit that, to be
	a nigger is sometimes practic'ly
	fatal, but the wife don't
	understand all of that, she thinks
	niggers are just so much dirt,
	which anybody ought to know better
	if they been on their ass their
	ownselves -- and that is the cause
	of his profound unhappiness, Buddy,
	that no-good-mean wife with all her
	Southern prejudice against niggers
	and everything!

It is a very long speech and delivered with a non-stop
vitality that leaves Buddy a trifle groggy. Slowly, he shakes
his head, as enter Mother.

			MOTHER 
	The Doctor is here. And Brother,
	supper is ready.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of the Hillyer family minus Rose eating dinner in the
dining room. The meal is almost finished, Daddy cutting apple
pie.

			DADDY 
	Is that Doctor still up there,
	Brother.

			BUDDY 
	Yeah, he's still up there.

			DADDY 
	What's taking the rascal so long?

			MOTHER 
	Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a
	rascal, he's one of the finest
	physicians in Glenville. He studied
	at Johns Hopkins University.

			DADDY 
	I don't care where the polecat
	studied.

			MOTHER 
	Sometimes the negativism and
	cynicism in you makes me want to
	vomit. 
		(shakes her head sadly as
		 Buddy surreptitiously
		 puts his napkin on table)
	Your real trouble is that you're
	anti-intellectual. The irony is
	women are supposed to be emotional,
	but I never saw anybody who
	depended more on emotion and
	prejudice than you do.

			BUDDY 
		(a half audible murmur)
	Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.

			MOTHER 
	Now I have a plan about Rose, an
	educational plan. She's getting
	better and we don't want any more
	trouble --
		(notices Buddy slipping
		 out)
	Brother, you ought to hear this.

			BUDDY 
	I'll be right back.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he slips out during following
speech.

			MOTHER 
	First, those clothes she wears.
	They're too provocative. I've
	talked to her a lot about it and I
	think she understands...

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy as he goes down the hall, eyes
narrowed.

ON Buddy posted in the doorway of the living room. He has his
hands on his hips Daddy-style and is staring sternly up the
stairs.

CUT TO A POV SHOT of Dr. Martinson with his black bag in hand
and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs. The man is
slinking, has quilt written all over him. As he goes down the
stairs he glances to one side, sees Buddy and frowns. The man
gives a sudden nervous start of fright as we hear Daddy's
voice loud on the TRACK.

			DADDY (O.S.)
	Everything all right, Doctor?

CUT TO A POV shot of Daddy at the rear of the downstairs
hall, napkin in hand and hands on hips. He is staring sternly
at the doctor.

CUT BACK TO the Doctor. He glances nervously again toward
Buddy.

ANOTHER POV SHOT of Buddy. Looks just like Daddy, hands on
hips.

ON Dr. Martinson, as he looks back at Daddy.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Oh, yes. Yes. Just fine. A few more
	days... a little more rest...
	she'll be perfectly healthy.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy as he walks forward down the hall
toward Buddy. The CAMERA PICKS UP Buddy and both of them
grimly stare after the fleeing doctor.

			DADDY 
		(in a low, conspiratorial
		 tone)
	What do you think, Brother?

			BUDDY 
	I don't know. But you better watch
	him like a hawk, if he comes back
	again.

			DADDY 
	He's not coming back again. We
	scared the rascal off, son.
		(puts a hand on Buddy's

	Come on back to supper. Your mother
	has a theory about how to educate
	Rose.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A SHOT of Mother and Rose and the children in the kitchen. We
see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. Rose has
on a new and modest little dress that Mother evidently has
made for her.

			MOTHER 
	You see, Rose? Now that's the kind
	of dress you ought to wear.

			ROSE
		(less than enthusiastic)
	Yeah, it's kinda nice.

			MOTHER 
	You look very pretty in it, Rose.
	Really, you do.

			ROSE 
		(smiles at Mother)
	Well, you're real sweet to make it
	for me.
		(puts an arm around
		 Mother's shoulder)
	There never was nobody like you.
	And you don't need to worry, I
	ain't goin' out no more.

			MOTHER 
	Well, there's no reason you
	shouldn't go out, Rose... in
	moderation.

			ROSE 
		(a little shrug)
	I don't want to. When I was lyin'
	there in that hospital bed at
	death's door I says to myself, I
	ain't goin' out no more. If I ever
	get outta this, I'll just stay
	home.

Rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there
in panties and bra, oblivious of Buddy and the children. She
has about as much modesty as a small child herself.

			ROSE (CONT'D)
		(rather sadly)
	Besides, there ain't no Mr. Right
	out there. Or if there is I can't
	find him, all I find is a pile of
	Mr. Wrongs. I ain't goin' out no
	more.

see them shaking hands with the Minister. Rose smiles
sweetly, modestly.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A driving up in the driveway of
the Hillyer house.

ANOTHER ANGLE on them all as they get out of the car. Rose
takes Doll's hand with one hand and Waski's hand with the
other.

			ROSE 
	All right, we'll play monopoly
	then.

Mother, Daddy and Buddy watch Rose go up the steps with Doll
and Waski.

			MOTHER 
	She's like a different person.
	Being so sick made a big impression
	on her. I really think she's
	learned a lesson.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm.

		 up steps, then turns to
		 Buddy and in a low tone)
	Come with me, Brother. I want to
	show you something.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE GARDEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in a rose garden below the
windows of the house.

It is Hawkshaw the Detective and his Unwilling Assistant.
Daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.

			DADDY 
	See that, son? Now this is a heel,
	see, and there, that's the ball of
	a foot. Someone has been walking
	here.

			BUDDY 
		(reluctantly)
	Well, it's not very plain.

			DADDY 
	That is because it rained recently,
	the rain has obscured the evidence.
	But you could still take plaster
	casts of these footprints, then
	match up the plaster casts with
	whosever shoes they are, and that
	way you could catch him --
	understand?

			BUDDY 
	But how would you find him?

			DADDY 
	Well. Well, what I mean is, you
	could prove it was his shoes if you
	did catch him. But look this,
	Brother, it is even more
	interesting. Look at this mark
	here, and that mark over there. Now
	wouldn't you say those marks are
	the marks of a ladder?

			BUDDY 
	Well, I don't know. 
		(trying to sound like a
		 fellow detective, but
		 doesn't want Rose to get
		 caught)
	No, I don't know, Daddy, I think
	the rain has obscured it.

			DADDY 
	True, but if you look sharply you
	can see that those marks are the
	marks of a ladder. Now let's go
	back to the garage and see if the
	ladder has been tampered with.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are
scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the
garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead
ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this,
it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny.

			DADDY 
		(points to ladder, eyes
		 narrowed)
	See, son? The paint is flaked off
	here, freshly. Look at it, Brother,
	there is no question about it. Some
	person or persons unknown have very
	recently tampered with this ladder.

			BUDDY 
	Well... maybe...

			DADDY 
	And there's only one reason anybody
	would want this ladder -- to get up
	into Rose's bedroom in the dark of
	night! I am going to chain up this
	ladder and padlock it! -- and that
	is not all I am going to do!

			DADDY 
	I mean a human investment, Rose, we

	She hasn't actually done
	anything...

			DADDY 
		(very firmly)
	Just a moment, dear. 
		(turns to Rose and almost
		 sadly)
	We can't have it, Rose. Can you
	behave yourself -- or not? That is
	the question, to behave or not to
	behave, to suffer the slings and
	arrows of outrageous chastity and
	keep your skirt down or to hoist it
	in the light of the moon and make
	whoopee -- that is the coil
	shuffling question. 
		(a dramatic pause, then
		 points at her)
	If you can't behave I am going to
	fire you and I say it in front of
	you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it.
	I point my rigid finger right at
	your nose, Rose, and I stare
	unwaveringly into your big blue

		(very meekly)
	Yes, sir.

INT. HILLYER HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy, Doll and Waski as they climb from the
crawl space down into the cellar by the furnace.

			DOLL 
	Well, if she's got any sense at

	Open up, Rose! Procrastination
	won't help you!

Finally, the CLICK of a bolt and slowly the door opens. We

	All right, where is he? Where's the
	culprit?

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Where are you, you son of a bitch?

In her distress and dismay, the sheet has come down over
Rose's shoulder and one of her breasts is exposed.

	Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very

	there wasn't no place else to go.

			DADDY 
	Well, it was a silly question.

			ROSE 
	He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He
	wants to be a fireman.

			DADDY 
	Ye gods and little fishes, a
	fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose,
	you're naked as a jay bird. When
	you're dressed, come on downstairs.
	I'm afraid your friend Billy is
	injured, where are his clothes?

			ROSE 
		(begins weeping, both
		 breasts now are exposed)
	Under the mattress. I hid 'em so
	you wouldn't be mad. He wants to
	marry me, he loves me. I can't
	marry him, he's too young and
	hasn't got no job, but he loves
	me... now you wouldn't hurt him,
	would you?

	Rose, darlin', you break my heart.
	But I am only a human man myself of
	the father variety. Rose, pack your
	bag, baby, as of this moment you
	are hired, mired and fired.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The
dissolve suggests that some time has gone by. Daddy looks a
bit grim, Rose has a wan and depressed expression. Mother
looks worried.

			DADDY 
		(politely)
	Well, Rose, going out to look for a
	job today?

			ROSE 
		(eyes down)
	What's the use, there ain't none.

			DADDY 
	Mmm. Would you get me another half
	a-cup of coffee, dear?

Rose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to Mother.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	It has been three weeks since I
	"fired" her. Is there no way to get
	rid of this girl? Are we stuck with
	her for life?

			MOTHER 
	She can't get a job, it's a
	depression. And we can't just throw
	her out on the street.

			DADDY 
	The hell we can't.

Rose returns with coffee and pours it out for Daddy.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you don't look well and you
	haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.

			ROSE 
	I'm not hungry. I can't eat
	nothin', I haven't been able to eat
	since I got fired. I think maybe
	I'm sick.

			DADDY 
	God forbid. You're not sick, Rose,
	forget it. Don't get any notions in
	your head, you're not sick.

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

			MOTHER 
	She does look a little peaky.

			DADDY
	No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine.
	She's perfectly healthy, don't give
	her ideas.

			ROSE 
	Well, I'll do the dishes, then I'm
	goin' to lie down a minute and
	rest. My stomach hurts.

Daddy watches Rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward
and speaks to Mother, his expression a bit sly.

			DADDY 
	Her plan is obvious, plain as day.
	She's going on a hunger strike. The
	question is, how do we foil her?

			MOTHER 
	She's just nervous and worried. And
	you would be, too, if you had no
	job and no place to go.

			DADDY 
		(thinking hard)
	Something has got to be done or
	Rose is going to be in this house
	forever.

A shot of the Model A coming up the driveway of the Hillyer
House. It is late afternoon.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy getting out of the car. He has a
triumphant little smile on his face.

A shot of Daddy as he walks onto the patio, a rolled-up copy
of the Glenville Tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the
back of his head. He definitely has a triumphant expression.
Buddy on the patio notices it.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the kitchen on Mother and Rose. Mother is
helping a rather wan Rose prepare dinner. Enter Daddy.

			DADDY 
		(as if everyone will be
		 pleased)
	Well, I have got news! I called
	long distance and spoke to Cousin
	Hop and you'll be glad to know,
	Rose, I have found you a job!

			ROSE 
	Tennessee?

			DADDY 
	Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!

			ROSE 
	Well. What kinda job is it?

			DADDY 
	Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a
	fine, outdoor-type job.

			ROSE 
	You mean a farm?

			DADDY 
	No, no, not exactly. It isn't a
	farm in the sense that it's a farm.
	Not at all. It's a... dairy
	establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm
	sure you'll like it because it's
	so... peaceful!

Rose bows her head and begins crying.

			MOTHER 
	Honey, Rose was born on a farm and
	has terrible memories of farm life.
	Now I don't think --

			DADDY 
	Just a minute, Rose, you don't
	understand. This isn't a dirt farm
	like the one you were born on, it's
	nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I
	talked to him on the phone, a fine
	man... it's not a farm, damn it,
	it's a beautiful dairy
	establishment! Stop crying, Rose!
	Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's
	ideal!

			MOTHER 
	I don't know how you can call it
	ideal -- don't you know what the
	word "farm" means to her?

			DADDY 
	I don't give a hoot in hell's
	hollow what it means to her! She
	can't stay in this house forever! I
	fired her, damn it!

			MOTHER 
	It sounds like a farm to me.
	Calling it a dairy establishment,
	that's just trickery and flummery.

			DADDY 
	Trickery and flummery or not, she's
	going there tomorrow on the bus!
	It's settled! And I must say we've
	been more than fair to you, Rose,
	it's pretty selfish and mean
	hearted of you to sit there and cry
	like that!

Rose sits head bowed at the kitchen table.

			ROSE 
	I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm
	cryin' because of somebody else.

			DADDY 
		(stops in mid-air, so to
		 speak)
	What?

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy outside on the patio, listening
intently at the window. He leans forward with a keen
interest, eyes wide.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Daddy. He is peering intently at Rose.

			DADDY 
	What did you say, Rose?

CLOSE ON Rose, as she turns, weeping.

			ROSE 
	Well, I was born on a farm
	myself... and I hate to think of
	the baby being born on one.

On them all. Daddy and Mother stare in shock at Rose.

			DADDY 
	What baby? What baby? What baby are
	you speaking about?

			ROSE 
	Mine.

			DADDY 
	Your baby?

			ROSE 
	Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

			DADDY 
		(he is "poleaxed,"
		 staggered)
	Good God almighty. This is a
	catastrophe, they won't hire her.

			MOTHER 
		(looks up, sees Buddy in
		 patio window)
	Brother, get out of that window!

Buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. Both Mother and
Daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned
with him.

			DADDY
		(stares off groggily into
		 space)
	This is a total catastrastroke. As
	of this moment I am stumped, I
	admit, I am stumped and treed both,
	the hound dogs have me surrounded.

			MOTHER 
		(as Rose begins crying)
	Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know
	you feel awful, but don't cry,
	honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the
	father, dear?

			ROSE 
	Well, I... I... I don't know...
	maybe it was... but no, you can't
	be sure about a thing like that. It
	wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.

			MOTHER 
		(gently)
	I know it's embarrassing... but who
	were you exposed to, dear?
	ROSE 
	Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h,
	that's kinda hard to say.

			DADDY 
	You're not going to get anywhere
	with that line of questioning. The
	problem is, what are we going to
	do?

			MOTHER 
	That's why I'm asking her who the
	father is. It's the most vital
	question of all. Who's the father,
	dear?

			DADDY 
		(offhand; he is thinking
		 hard about what to do)
	She already told you, she doesn't
	know.

			MOTHER
		(naively)
	But she must know... unless...
	unless... Rose, was there more than
	one person?

			ROSE 
		(weeping in handkerchief)
	Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't
	think. I... I'm not really sure.

			MOTHER 
		(gently, a tiny frown, a
		 bit shocked)
	Rose, really, you shouldn't act
	like that.

			ROSE 
		(weeping)
	Oh, I know. But I didn't, really.
	Honestly, I didn't. There was only
	one, but he's out of town and leave
	no forwardin' address.

			DADDY
		(a brilliant idea)
	Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No
	forwarding address, huh? 
		(turns to Mother)
	In the shock of this brilliant
	move, I forgot something.

			MOTHER 
	What did you forget?

			DADDY 
	I forgot that Rose will lie like a
	child. She's no more pregnant than
	I am, she just doesn't want to go
	to that farm!

			ROSE 
	Yes, I am.

			DADDY 
	No, you're not.

			ROSE 
	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.

			DADDY 
		(triumphant, sure he's
		 right)
	All right, tell us, Rose, what
	makes you think you're pregnant?

			ROSE
		(simply)
	I haven't had my period for three
	months and my stomach is getting
	big.

			DADDY
		(again "poleaxed" for a
		 moment, but pulls himself
		 together)
	I don't believe it.

			ROSE
	It's so, Mr. Hillyer.

			DADDY
	All right, damn it. We've seen you
	with your clothes off around here,
	stand up and pull up your dress and
	let's take a look!

			MOTHER
	Honey!

			DADDY
	She doesn't have to take her
	panties off, we can see her stomach
	with 'em on. All she has to do is
	pull up her dress and let us see
	her belly.

			ROSE 
	Well, all right, if you just won't
	believe me.

Rose stands up.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you don't have to.

			ROSE 
	I don't mind.

			DADDY 
	Now, you will see, she's lying like
	she always does -- that belly will
	be flat as a pancake!

Rose lifts her dress and Daddy leans forward eagerly to
confirm his belief. Rose stands there with her skirt lifted.
She has on a pair of skimpy white panties. An unmistakable,
definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel
just above the line of her panties. A stupefied look is on
Daddy's face.

			MOTHER 
	I'd say about three months. Are you
	satisfied?

			DADDY 
	I am poleaxed and in a non compos
	mentis condition. I wash my hands
	or the whole thing.

	What's goin' on?

			BUDDY 
	Rose says she's goin' to have a
	baby and she sure looks it, but I
	don't think so.

			DOLL 
	A baby... and she isn't even
	married.

			BUDDY 
	That's the least of her troubles.
	Rose had a rare tropic disease and
	the little tubes in her that babies
	swim down are all stopped up, she
	told me all about it.

terror on his shoulder.

			ROSE 
	Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all
	up! They're gonna cut my stummick
	all open, I'll die!

			BUDDY 
		(trying to be brave)
	You won't die, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S SOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Dr. Martinson's private office in his home,
quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. A
sober-looking Mother and Daddy sit talking to him. He almost
seems to relish the situation.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I'm not surprised you thought she
	was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can
	look very much like pregnancy. But
	it was pure wishful thinking on her
	part. The girl can never have
	children, she had gonorrhea at
	fifteen and it was untreated.

			MOTHER 
		(shocked, rather feebly)
	Gonorrhea?

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Don't worry, Madam, she can't
	infect your dear little kiddies.
	She long ago fully recovered, but
	the disease did irreparable damage.
	The girl is permanently barren.

			MOTHER 
	Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose,
	what a life she has had.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	We make our own lives, Madam. As
	for malignancy, I don't think so,
	it's very unlikely. I probably
	shouldn't have even mentioned that
	possibility to her.

			MOTHER 
		(rather coldly, seems
		 disenchanted with him)
	No, you shouldn't have, it was
	needlessly cruel. She thinks she
	has cancer and is going to die.

			DR. MARTINSON
	She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was
	merely giving her the facts.

			DADDY 
	Well, it's a disaster. I don't know
	what to say, Doctor, I am floored.
	How dangerous is the operation?

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Any major operation is dangerous.
	However, as we know from her
	previous illness, she's a very
	strong girl.

			DADDY 
	Well, if it isn't malignant and she
	can get through the operation all
	right, it might be better than her
	really being pregnant. She doesn't
	even know who the father might have
	been.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Oh, it's definitely better, beyond
	question. A fatherless child, an
	ignorant girl with no job, no
	money, no home. It's fortunate, a
	blessing really, and a stroke of
	good luck for another reason I want
	to mention to you.

			MOTHER 
		(totally disenchanted with
		 the Doctor)
	This conversation is making me a
	little sick.

			DADDY 
	Honey, that's no way to talk to the
	Doctor, he's merely doing his job,
	dear.

Oddly enough, in the stress of the situation, Daddy now seems
almost friendly to Dr. Martinson, whom previously he
considered a polecat.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in the waiting room. He is
helping her lie on the couch on pillows as she weeps, a hand
over her face.

			BUDDY
	I gotta find out what they're
	saying. You lie back and rest,
	Rose, and I'll give you a report on
	it.

			ROSE 
	I don't want to know...

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE shot of Dr. Martinson. An expression of
distaste is on his face. The CAMERA pulls back as he talks to
Mother and Daddy.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I'm sorry the truth nauseates you,
	Mrs. Hillyer, because before you
	leave there's a bit more of it I'd
	like to put to you. This operation
	provides a therapeutic opportunity
	that I feel is quite important in
	regard to this particular girl, who
	suffers not only from an ovarian
	cyst but from a certain
	psychoneurotic condition as well.

			MOTHER 
	What do you mean, what kind of
	gobbledygook talk is that?

			DADDY 
	Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am
	following you.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(gives Mother an aloof
		 glance, then to Daddy)
	First, about the girl's history.
	Evidently she's been very
	promiscuous since early childhood,
	she has no control over her sexual
	impulses. Furthermore, she is
	permanently barren, she can't have
	children.

			DADDY 
	Go on, Doctor.

			MOTHER
		(quietly)
	Yes, go on.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I am thinking particularly of the
	other ovary. As a rule I don't
	believe in removing it. The woman's
	hormonal system is profoundly
	disturbed, she is subject to
	possibly serious depression, she
	loses many of her secondary sexual
	characteristics for example, her
	breasts might shrink and become
	flabby, facial hair might appear
	along with a coarsening of the
	features, and of course her sexual
	drive is greatly diminished,
	especially in a girl or young
	woman. For these reasons I am
	opposed to removing the other
	ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

			DADDY 
	I am ahead of you.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Then... may I speak quite frankly
	with you, Mr. Hillyer?

			DADDY 
	Please do.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I have of course observed the girl
	in treating her.

			DADDY 
	Of course.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I think we both know her.

			DADDY 
	Yes, we know her.

			MOTHER 
	What are you talking about? I don't
	understand all this mumbo jumbo and
	the funny looks on your faces.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in
	more ways than one. She is an
	extreme psychoneurotic with
	uncontrollable sexual impulses. It
	would be a mercy to spare her the
	suffering she causes herself and
	others. Therefore I recommend as a
	therapeutic measure the removal of
	her second ovary. It is ethically
	and medically the only proper
	decision in this case and I suspect
	your husband agrees with me.

			DADDY 
	Reluctantly, I do. It would be a
	blessing to her and everyone else.
	The girl is oversexed and I say --
	spay her!

			MOTHER 
		(slowly rises to her feet
		 and in a trembling voice)
	Over... my... dead... body!

A long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson stare at
Mother in surprise. She stares at the Doctor with fire in her
eyes. He seems already to shrink a little. Finally she speaks
with a calm fury.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	Are you human beings or are you
	some kind of male monsters? Is
	there no limit to which you won't
	go to keep your illusions about
	yourselves?

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(shrinking a little)
	Illusions, Madam?

			MOTHER 
	You'd go so far as to mutilate a
	helpless girl who has no means to
	defend herself, you'd go that far?
	Don't you think I know what you've
	just said and don't you think I
	understand the dreadful and
	revolting crime you've just
	conspired to commit?

Dr. Martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by
the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation.

He opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out.
Mother turns to Daddy.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	I thought I knew you. I thought I
	knew you better, I thought in your
	heart you were a good and kind man.
	Well, I can't believe what I've
	just heard in this room. A
	defenseless girl depending on you
	for protection, and you propose to
	mutilate and destroy her. How could
	you listen even for a moment to
	that sadistic man?

			DADDY
		(slightly shattered)
	Well, now, darlin'... give me a
	chance to defend myself.

			MOTHER 
	I can't believe you really meant
	it, if I did I'd want to die. You
	aren't a male monster, that man is
	but you aren't. Look me in the eye
	and tell me, do you really want to
	take Rose's womanhood away from her
	when it's all she has got?

			DADDY 
	Well, I... I hadn't thought about
	it that much. I was thinking...
	well, it's an idea, the girl is
	oversexed, and...

			MOTHER 
	Rose isn't oversexed, that's
	ridiculous. If you're going to talk
	nonsense, I don't want to talk to
	you at all. Rose is exactly the
	same as the rest of us, except more
	so.

			DADDY 
	Well, I know, more so. That's why I
	was thinking... maybe she'd be
	better off.

			MOTHER
		(with a quiet fury)
	Better off? How could she ever find
	love and happiness, if you did what
	you're talking about? Are you
	insane?

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(rather feebly)
	Now, may I say, I am against that
	particular procedure, as a general
	rule. But in a case of near
	nymphomania, it doesn't seem
	monstrous to me at all, but
	medically advisable.

Both Mother and Daddy totally ignore him. Mother's eyes are
fixed on Daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring
down at the floor.

			DADDY 
	Well, now, I admit... in Rose's
	case, it would be cruel. If Rose
	wasn't attractive and pretty...
	well, it would probably be bad for
	almost any young woman. I don't
	know exactly what I was thinking
	about, the doctor said it and it
	sounded reasonable.

Daddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error like a
man.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	But you're right, darlin', you're
	absolutely dead right, it would be
	an awful and horrible thing to do.
	I'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I
	didn't mean it.

Mother turns from Daddy and walks up to the desk and stares
down at Dr. Martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which
she intends to step.

			MOTHER 
	I will not cry like a woman. If I'm
	upset it's because of what my
	husband said, not because of you.
	You can't make me cry like a woman,
	a woman has got just as much
	intelligence and self-control as a
	man. And you get this in your head.
	If you hurt that girl, I'll hire
	lawyers and sue you for malpractice
	for every penny you have got, I'll
	do my level best to ruin you. Do
	you understand me?

			DR. MARTINSON
		(a sickly smile, he is
		 licked totally)
	Yes, I understand you, but you have
	misunderstood me completely.

			MOTHER 
		(icy cold)
	I understand you perfectly. You
	leave that girl alone, you wretched
	man, or you will be sorry.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(a foolish smile, as if
		 Mother has paid him some
		 kind of compliment)
	Actually of course I won't operate,
	I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy
	will operate and of course he'll be
	guided by your wishes in this
	respect.

			MOTHER 
	Let him be guided not by my wishes
	and not by Rose's wishes, although
	I am sure they are identical. Let
	him be guided by the wishes of the
	creative power of life itself,
	because that is what has spoken
	through me tonight.

Daddy stops beside her, puts an arm around her shoulders and
with weary irony.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	We all love you, darlin'.

Daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter
and walks out of the kitchen on the patio, as the CAMERA
stays on Rose and mother.

			MOTHER 
	Don't worry, honey, you'll find
	something.

			ROSE 
	I was offered that job as a
	waitress.

			MOTHER 
	Forget about it, I don't want you
	working in one of those honky
	tonks.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the patio. He has eight or nine
gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them
and emptying out the seed. He glances up as Rose walks up to
him, pocketbook in hand. She seems a little sad. But she
smiles at him.

			ROSE 
	Hi, Buddy. 
		(puts an arm around his
		 shoulders)
	How's my sweetheart who never told
	on me when I was bad?

			BUDDY 
	Okay.

			ROSE 
		(picks up a hollowed out
		 gourd)
	Makin' homes for purple martins,
	huh? We had 'em on the farm.
	They're the prettiest things.
	That's what I wish I was, a bird.
	Just fly around catch bugs and have
	a lot of fun.

			BUDDY 
	What are you going to do, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Take a little walk with me, huh?

EXT. HILLYER HOME - GARDEN

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy on a beautiful summer day
walking in the garden behind the Hillyer house. They walk up
to an empty rabbit hutch. The hutch is made of rough lumber
and chicken wire and has cubicles for about a dozen rabbits.

			ROSE
		(as she stares at the
		 empty hutch)
	I guess I'll work as a waitress,
	Buddy. I done that before and it
	got me in worse trouble than you
	could know, but I can't stay here
	no more. Why did you get rid of
	your rabbits, Buddy?

			BUDDY 
	They're dumb things. I got tired of
	them.

			ROSE 
		(smiles, touches chicken
		 wire)
	Did you know when I was a child we
	had pretty near five hundred
	rabbits?

			BUDDY 
	Five hundred rabbits?

			ROSE 
	Yep, we had 'em in orange crates
	all over. It was Daddy's dream. He
	was goin' to get rich raisin'
	rabbits. It was what killed Daddy.
	He didn't drown hisself till a long
	time later after Momma and Lunette
	died of typhoid, but it was them
	rabbits what killed him.

			BUDDY 
	How did the rabbits kill him?

			ROSE 
	He thought he could sell 'em, but
	nobody but country folks eat
	rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got
	no money. We had to eat them dern
	rabbits our own selves. Every dern
	one, and it took about four years
	to eat 'em all up.

			BUDDY
		(a little smile)
	Well, that doctor said you got
	protein somewhere and I guess he
	was right.

			ROSE 
	Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But
	later on after Momma died and Daddy
	wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin',
	I sure would of been glad for a
	little rabbit stew. You know, I
	oughtn't to of told you about what
	Daddy done when I was a child.
	Until them rabbits ruined him, he
	was a real good man, Buddy.

			BUDDY 
	What was your mother like?

			ROSE 
	A saint just like your own mother.
	She's up in heaven right now, her
	and Lunette, there ain't no doubt
	about it.

ANOTHER ANGLE as Buddy and Rose walk away hand in hand away
from the rabbit hutch.

			BUDDY 
	Maybe it was eating all those
	rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to
	me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito
	bite. 
		(stops, smiles, puts an
		 arm around his shoulders)
	I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't
	want sex, Buddy, girls want love.

HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM NIGHT

A shot of Mother and Daddy in the Hillyer living room late at
night. Mother sits with a worried expression on a chair, a
kimono around her shoulders. Daddy is pacing worriedly in
pajamas and a bathrobe. He looks at his wristwatch.

			DADDY 
	It's twenty after one.

			MOTHER 
	I don't understand it. Even in the
	wild days she was never as late as
	this.

			DADDY 
	I'm afraid it's my fault. I made
	her feel guilty this morning --
		(glances around, sees
		 something in doorway)
	Brother, what are you doing up?

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy in pajamas as he enters the living
room.

			BUDDY 
	I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose
	come in?

			DADDY 
	No, she hasn't. 
		(frowns, looks around)
	I think I hear a car.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY

CUT TO a shot of a 1930's automobile in the Hillyer driveway
at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here
DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in
a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him
on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes
are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something
important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated,
almost as if awed.

			DAVE 
		(rather stiffly)
	I want to thank you for a wonderful
	afternoon and evenin'. Can I see
	you in the mornin'?

			ROSE 
		(a bit breathless)
	Yes. Year you can, you sure can.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy peering out of the window of the
living room.

			DADDY
	Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,

			MOTHER 
	Who?

			DADDY 
	You know Dave, his wife used to do
	dressmaking for you before she
	died.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the steps. Happy as a clam, she
turns and waves at Dave in the car, then goes on up the
steps.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of the front hall as Rose comes through the
front door. She is very excited, happy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA follows her as she goes into the living room with
her big news.

			ROSE 
	You'll never guess what happened! 
		(pauses, then
		 dramatically)
	I have met Mr. Right! I been with
	him all day and he loves me, I know
	he does, he loves me and he's going
	to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me
	already!

			MOTHER 
	Well... well, that's wonderful,

INT. CHURCH - DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS of a wedding in a tiny country church. We see
shots of Rose in a white wedding dress, smiling, happy. Dave
is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives
Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see
Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday
best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees
trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country
minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic
country wedding in a very plain, unpretentious country
church, and...

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic
celebration outside the church by a running brook.

The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then
Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.

			ROSE 
	And now Waski, are you and Buddy
	and Dolly ready for some ice cream,
	huh? Do you like picnics or don't
	you?

			WASKI 
	We like 'em! We love 'em!

			DAVE 
	Well, it isn't a picnic, honey.
	It's a barbecue.

			ROSE
		(a little smile)
	Okay.

			DAVE 
	A picnic doesn't involve roast
	meat, hon. At a barbecue you have a
	lot of roast meat.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy as he stares pensively at Dave.
The CAMERA stays on him as we hear VOICES OVER. Rose is
happy, Dave phlegmatic.

			ROSE (V.O.) 
	Well, all I know is there's ice
	cream. And I'm gonna have me a
	plate right now!

			DAVE (V.O.)
	Better wait, hon. It'll spoil your
	appetite. Have some barbecue first.

	Well, we are off to Savannah, Mr.
	Hillyer. No more police work, I'm
	getting in the construction field.

			DADDY 
	Good luck, Dave. And good luck to
	you, too, Rosebud.

			ROSE

	Oh, Mr. Hillyer! I just can't stand

see Doll and Waski solemn on the back seat, but Buddy is not
visible.

			DADDY 
	Well, thank God we are rid of her
	at last. And the best thing of all
	is that she's happy. The little nut
	is happy, she found Mr. Right in
	the nick of time!

			MOTHER 
	Well, yes, she's happy. Of course
	Dave doesn't have her life force,
	not at all. There isn't much
	furniture in his house, just a
	table and one or two chairs,
	whereas Rose has furniture coming
	out of the windows.

			DADDY 
	Honey, he is Mr. Right.

			MOTHER 
		(slowly nods)
	Yes, I think so. He adores her,
	it's almost pitiful the way he
	worships her. I just hope she isn't
	too much for him.

Mother pauses, frowning, she has her doubts, looks over her
shoulder.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	What do you think, Brother?

Mother frowns in surprise.

CUT TO a POV shot of Buddy on the back seat of the car. Now
it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. Be is
lying down on the seat of the car with his Sunday coat pulled
over his head.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother and Buddy, Doll, Waski. Buddy lies on
the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	What's the matter with him?

			DOLL 
		(seems awed, staring down
		 at Buddy)
	I don't know. I think he's cryin'!

CUT TO ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother, from the front as she slowly
turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. The shot is also on
Daddy. They both stare ahead in pensive silence. Finally
Mother speaks.

	Maybe Brother is right. Maybe so.

INT./EXT. HERTZ CAR ON INTERSTATE - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer behind the wheel of the Hertz car. He is
staring pensively ahead, a faint trace of tears in his eyes.
It is a very faint trace, a look of mild irony and amusement
is on his face.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(dryly, to himself)
	Mr. Right. Dave Wilkie.

Willcox slowly shakes his head.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - INTERSTATE EXIT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it takes a turn-off from an
Interstate.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - BUSTLING CITY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it drives into a rather
bustling little Southern city that does not look at all like
the "Glenville" we have seen. A lot of traffic, new roads,
filling stations, prosperity. It could be Rome, Georgia as it
is today.

EXT. CAR PAST HOLIDAY INN - DAY

ANOTHER SHOT of the red Ford going past a modern Holiday Inn
in the city.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

ON the red Ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of
the old Hillyer home.

But insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic
from the past.
Maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the
place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he gets out of the red Ford and
walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in
hand.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer at the front door. He tries the knob,
opens the door and goes inside.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he glances into the
living room. The room looks the same but different -it is
musty, dim.

Willcox Hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and
the CAMERA follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into
Mother's old bedroom-study. This room is quite different. The
four poster is gone. The room is dusty, musty, dark.
Magazines are on the floor in a ring around Mother's old
study chair. We see "male" things. It is apparent Daddy lives
alone in this room.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall
back to the kitchen.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

He looks around. No one is there. He glances at a modern
refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape, glances with a
frown at dishes in the sink unwashed. He goes on out to the
patio.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table
on the patio. Daddy now is a very old man, but his
personality and style are the same as ever. He looks up with
a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio.

			DADDY 
	Well, you rascal, where'd you come
	from?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Hello, Daddy. How are you?

			DADDY 
	About as good as can be expected
	with one foot in the grave. Good to
	see you, son. 
		(they shake hands)
	Did you bring any of that Yankee
	whisky with you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's
	Scotch.

			DADDY 
	It's Yankee whisky to me.

Daddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	How do you stand it up there, boy,
	in all that ice and snow? What are
	you, a polar bear?

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they enter the
kitchen. The former opens his travel bag and takes out a
bottle of Teacher's.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	I can use a drink after the plane
	ride I had.

			DADDY 
	Your wife and children are back in
	New Hampshire in the snow?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a little smile; it is
		 summer, there couldn't be
		 snow in New Hampshire)
	Yeah, they're in the snow.

Willcox opens whisky, looks for glasses in the dusty familiar
cupboard.

			DADDY
	Are they polar bears, too?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(frowns at cupboard)
	Good God, the way you live here.
	This place hasn't been dusted since
	Mother died. Look at that goddamned
	refrigerator.

			DADDY 
	Got another twenty years in it,
	boy. 
		(something seems to be
		 bothering him)
	By the way, son, do you recall
	Rose, that pretty blonde girl who
	came to our house way back in 1935
	or 1936 and caused such a damnable
	commotion.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(frowns, turns and stares
		 at him)
	Of course I recall Rose. In fact
	I've been thinking of no one else
	for the last hour and a half.

			DADDY 
	How could that be, son?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Dave Wilkie of all people was
	sitting by me on the plane -- her
	first husband. It's funny you would
	mention Rose. Did you hear from
	her?

Willcox pours out whisky.

			DADDY 
		(casually)
	Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
	You'll have the back bedroom, son,
	Mother's old art room. Just be
	careful going down the stairs you
	don't break your Yankee neck.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they walk with
their drinks out to the patio.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	What's all this about Rose? What do
	you mean, you heard from her in a
	manner of speaking?

			DADDY 
	Oh, I heard from her, I got a
	letter from her, she's fine. But
	there is some sad news.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	What sad news? Did her cancer come
	back?

			DADDY 
	Oh, no, no, she got all over that.
	Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Is her husband sick or something?

			DADDY 
	No, it's another thing. I was going
	to write you about it, but since
	you were coming down anyway I
	thought I'd wait till you got here.
	What did Dave Wilkie have to say?

ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they
sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not
disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual
and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news
really is.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	The pitiful son of a bitch said
	Rose was a nymphomaniac.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed
	you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	You're damn right it incensed me,
	the miserable bastard. He also said
	the kikes and the niggers have
	taken over Washington. D.C.

			DADDY
		(nods somberly)
	Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's
	pitiful like you say. When he lost
	Rose it ruined the man, it
	destroyed him totally when he lost
	Rose.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	He didn't lose her, he threw her
	away.

			DADDY 
	Yes, I guess he did. He threw her
	away and it was the mistake of his
	life.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(staring off pensively
		 into space)
	You know, I don't know this town
	any more. All this traffic, new
	buildings, prosperity...
		(pauses, almost as if in
		 pain)
	Where have the years gone, Daddy?
	Where is the little town I knew as
	a boy?

			DADDY 
	At rest in the creative universe
	with Mother, son.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a little smile)
	That's what she would say herself.

			DADDY
		(simply, he is not
		 emoting)
	A wonderful woman, boy.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	It always gives me a funny feeling
	to come home. Dear old Southland.
	Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --
		(a fond little smile)
	-- except you, you're still here.

			DADDY 
		(matter-of-factly)
	Not for long, boy. I've outstayed
	my welcome already.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	It's funny you would mention Rose,
	I was thinking about her all the
	way up in the car.
		(gives him a glance)
	Or maybe it isn't so funny.

			DADDY 
		(as if in previous
		 thought)
	I'm older than hell, boy. But this
	Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll
	say that.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	All right, Daddy. We have our
	drink, we're out on the patio, you
	have prepared me for it. Rose's
	cancer has come back, hasn't it?

			DADDY 
		(simply, quietly)
	No, son, she is dead. 

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(numb with shock, for a
		 moment can't speak or
		 think)
	Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she
	died?

			DADDY 
	I am afraid so, son. About a week
	ago. Her husband phoned me, she had
	asked him to call me if anything
	happened.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in awful shock)
	But... but how? She was young! Rose
	wasn't old!

			DADDY 
	She was fifty-six, son. Of course
	she didn't look it, nowhere near
	it. The cancer came back, I'm
	afraid I fibbed about that. But it
	was very quick, son. She was in the
	hospital only two weeks, and the
	last week she didn't know anything.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in distress, a slightly
		 choked voice)
	Excuse me, I'll be right back.

Willcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across
the patio to the kitchen door.

SHOT OF THE PATIO

ON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his
refreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face
is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Well, you have knocked me for a
	hell of a loop, old man. A hell of
	a loop.

			DADDY 
		(simply)
	I know. You loved her. So did I. It
	was an awful shock to me, too. An
	awful shock. Rose was so alive it's
	hard to believe.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	I can't believe it, Daddy. I know
	it must be true, but I can't
	believe it.

			DADDY 
	It's true, son. The girl with the
	cornflower eyes is dead, she is no
	more,

Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on
himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful
feeling is behind his words.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	She got cancer of the breast, was
	operated on and had a seven-year
	recovery, then after a brief
	illness passed on in her sleep, as
	the man with whom she'd lived in
	beautiful love and harmony for
	twenty-five years held her hand.
	That is what happened, son, and God
	rest her lovely soul!

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts
to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his
teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.

ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	And now, if you are through with
	that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the
	Holiday Inn and get some dinner.

SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER AND DADDY

as they walk toward the red rental Ford. Daddy uses a cane.
He is a very old man. Willcox Hillyer looks in pain, he
grimaces as they walk along.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?

			DADDY 
	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd
	want to?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	That's a hell of a thing to say.
	Why, Rose?

			DADDY 
		(stops and firmly)
	Now look, boy, get a grip on
	yourself. Rose had a good life. She
	found her. Right, didn't she? She
	triumphed over everything, what are
	you blubbering about?

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	I'm not blubbering.

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford going down the familiar
driveway.

stares ahead in gloom.

seen.

SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER

in deep gloom. Daddy eyes him and now relents. We see
sympathy in his face.

			DADDY 
		(gently)
	Rose isn't dead, son. Not really.
	Some of us die, but some of us
	don't. Rose lives. As long as some
	little girl somewhere gets herself
	up and goes out, Rose lives.

FADE IN:

EXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.
A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.

CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is
WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and
the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,
ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like
everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,
trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as
he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his
ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks
to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his
aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to
them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive.
We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track --
it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but
now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if
slightly annoyed by something.

CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man
at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and
looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE,
erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not
been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness,
he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very
unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline
representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily.
He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat.
We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the
track.

CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with
a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't
place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns
back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously
saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl,
turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance
away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the
tall, gaunt man at the next counter.

CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than
the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline
representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his
head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is
saying: "I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist.
What's the matter with this friggin' airline?"

CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he
rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the
man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry
Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place
the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on
Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at
this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a
distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played
with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong
in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC
becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost
to know the man.

MAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): "RAMBLING ROSE"

The MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard.

OTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action.

VARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to
recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug,
turns and walks away with his travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY

We see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the
plane.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive
young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He
is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face
when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real
affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry
and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit
in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley
sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,
then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make
corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.

Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight
frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and
enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the
dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I
will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do
not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will
be obvious from the acting.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(not on track)
	Buddd-dee! My God, if it ain't
	Buddy! Well, if this ain't the
	darnest thing!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an
idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained
embarrassed smile.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(not on track)
	Excuse me... your voice is familiar
	and I'm sure I know you from
	somewhere...

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(not on track, with
		 delighted injury)
	Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know
	me!

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(not on track)
	Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(not on track)
	It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie,
	don't you remember me?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(not on track)
	Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how
	are you?

The men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so.
We see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to
Hillyer.

EXT. KENNEDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing
turn and ROARING into a take-off.

INT. KENNEDY - DAY

CUT TO a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up.

END OF TITLES.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she
fixes drinks.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives
them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees
the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an
aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to
her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be
polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Well, I am in the construction
	business, Buddy, and without
	braggin' I have done real good at
	it. 
		(with a meaningful
		 bitterness)
	There are those who wouldn't have
	expected that out of me. 
		(pauses as if waiting for
		 a reaction, but Hillyer
		 is very silent)
	Right now I'm buildin' a giant
	motel unit near Alexandria, outside
	Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm
	on the construction side.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(making polite talk)
	Well, that's interesting, Dave. I
	always liked Washington, it's a
	pretty town.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York.
	But the niggers have took it over,
	just like every other city we got,
	only worse.

Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but
Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self
satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	But I have done real good in the
	construction field. What I don't
	know about buildin' ain't worth
	knowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight
	thousand smackeroos last year,
	how's that for an old country boy?

Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down
with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant
smile.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	Ha ha, course you make a lot more. 
		(points at the galleys)
	What's that you got there, Buddy?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(reluctantly)
	Galley proof.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Galley what?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Page proof of a book I'm working
	on.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	How about that. Well, you always
	were a screwball.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(lifts an eyebrow in mild
		 irony)
	Oh, yeah?

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(unfazed)
	I don't mean that the way it
	sounds. 
		(stares at galleys as if
		 rattlesnake)
	Imagine it, a book. And I used to
	know you personal way back when.
		(pauses, then earnestly)
	Tell me something, Buddy, how do
	you dream up all that stuff?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(absolutely straight)
	Well, actually, we have a little
	black boy named Her---t who lives
	in the garage. He does it for me.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(for a moment half
		 believes it, then a slow,
		 stupid grin)
	Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy,
	always jokin' around. Almost as
	much of a joker as your Daddy. 
		(drains his drink,
		 grimaces; a heavy
		 drinker, Dave)
	I saw your Daddy a coupla years
	ago, I was up in Glenville lookin'
	at a motel site. I guess that's
	where you're headed, huh, to see
	him?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(stares out of plane
		 window)
	That's right, Dave, I'm headed for
	Glenville on a whisperin' jet.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(suddenly calls out)
	Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us
	another drink! 
		(to Hillyer, sullenly)
	Dumb little bitch, supposed to give
	us two in the first place.

Willcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at
his temple.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	This friggin' airline's out of its
	mind. 
		(a martyr)
	The sons of bitches tried to put me
	in tourist.
		(portentuously
		 philosophical)
	But our whole civilization is
	screwed up, Buddy. The heebies and
	the coconuts have took it over and
	ruined it.

Willcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says
nothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie
gives him a headache.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings
two more drinks. Dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by
her charm.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Took your time gettin' here.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	She has other things to do, Dave.

Willcox smiles apologetically at girl.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Supposed to get two drinks in the
	first place. This friggin' airline
	can't do nothin' right.

The stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his
drink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl
as if to say, "Don't blame me because of this damned idiot,"
and she half smiles at him.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(obviously getting him off
		 subject)
	Tell me about that job in
	Alexandria, Dave, the big motel
	you're building.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(with pedantic exactitude,
		 the man is a complete
		 pain in the ass)
	Near Alexandria. It isn't in
	Alexandria, it is outside it.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	I see. Outside it.

			DAVE WILKIE
	That's correct -- outside it, not
	in it. As for the job, well, the
	Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of
	grief and we use a pile of niggers
	to haul and tote and they ain't
	worth a sorry-ass damn. 
		(takes big swallow of
		 drink)
	But I can build anything, Buddy.
	Give me the plans and I can build a
	goddamn staircase to the moon. It's
	a fact, I can build anything... 
		(pauses, then bitterly)
	... but she never believed that.
	Oh, hell, no, she never believed in
	me.

This is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown
"she." Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately
unresponsive.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	Um-m, well...

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(broodingly)
	Doubted my ability all along, the
	little bitch. I never remarried,
	Buddy, you know that, don't you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Well, no, I didn't actually.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	She's te reason -- cured me of
	women once and for all. Oh, I got
	rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste
	no time kickin' that bitch out.
	Hell, she was screwin' everybody in
	Savannah. I caught her in a motel
	with this long tall son of a bitch
	and boy did I beat the everlastin'
	piss out of him!

Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it
and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the
man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a
dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade
continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and
pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and
he is struggling to control himself.

Dave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the
hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	She didn't marry him, though, later
	she married another guy and went to
	Winston-Salem. It didn't last
	That girl couldn't have no lastin'
	marriage, she left him and married
	another dumb sucker and went out
	west. Little bitch left him, too,
	and you know what she's married to
	right now?
		(puts a big finger on
		 Hillyer's chest)
	A kike. That's right, some kind of
	kike horse doctor named Schapiro
	out in Seattle, who's got the nerve
	to have the same first name I got.
	Wouldn't you know it, Rose would
	wind up married to a goddamn kike?
	She was always out of her friggin'
	head and I'll tell you why.
		(his eyes narrow and again
		 he puts a finger on
		 Hillyer's chest)
	Buddy, she was sick in her mind and
	between her legs, too. She was
	a nymphomaniac.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
		(he has had enough; with a
		 pale trembling anger and
		 in even tone)
	Dave, you are as full of shit as a
	Christmas turkey and you know it.
	Now if you want to start a fight on
	this plane and get yourself in
	jail, go right ahead. But I am
	telling you, you are full of shit
	right up to your eyeballs.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(with surprising mildness;
		 a little smile almost as
		 if he is pleased)
	I don't want to start no fight with
	you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full
	of shit?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor
	and Rose has been a good wife to
	him for a long time. To call her a
	nymphomaniac is the most stupid
	thing I ever heard in my life.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(again surprisingly mild)
	You loved her, didn't you. Well, so
	did I. 
		(a little shrug)
	You'll have to admit she had four
	husbands.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Yeah, it took her a while to grow
	up and find Mr. Right, but she did
	it. She found him.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(another little smile)
	She used to call me Mr. Right.
	Remember that, Buddy?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(he is pale with anger)
	Yeah, I remember it.

Willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Well, I tell you, I don't know what
	the world's come to these days.
	Things used to be better. We didn't
	have any money, but things were
	better. 
		(grimaces in anger)
	Goddamn niggers and kikes burning
	the flag, rioting, raising hell --
	they ought to shoot their asses
	off. I tell you, Buddy, where this
	country made its mistake was
	allowing people without property to
	vote.

During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says
nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave
shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..

INT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY

A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta
airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of
the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is
politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(holds out hand)
	Well, got to get a plane to
	Savannah. Great running into you,
	Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(sweating, tense, under
		 some kind of awful
		 emotional strain)
	Ah-h, if you happen to run into
	Rose sometime... do me a favor,
	give her a message for me, will
	you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a trifle wearily)
	Dave, I haven't seen Rose for
	years.

Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ
GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.
In desperation, Dave takes his arm.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a
	heart attack last year, I wasn't
	expected to live.

Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly
explains.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	You might see her. She writes your
	Daddy, and she and that doctor came
	to see him, didn't they? I wish
	you'd tell her something... I never
	could write letters.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in a different tone,
		 interested, curious)
	What do you want me to tell her,
	Dave?

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(a painful inward
		 struggle; the man is
		 tormented, miserable)
	Oh, to hell with it, never mind.
	Don't tell her anything. Don't even
	tell her you saw me. 
		(half turns his back, his
		 face twisted with strong
		 emotion)
	Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my
	plane.

Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after
Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer
seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half
to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	He still loves her. The poor damn
	fool still loves her.

			HERTZ GIRL 
	Who was she?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	A girl named Rose.
		(pulls himself back into
		 the world of reality)
	Still take R75 to Glenville?

			HERTZ GIRL 
	Yes, sir.

Willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.

INT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY

CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the
car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion
is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with
amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on
the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or
music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.
Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the
titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY

A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a
house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is
BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he
shades his eyes to look at something far away.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl
walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE
takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase
tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are
dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and
seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her
primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and
sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with
the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she
stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to
her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened
and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted
from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She
blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces
herself to walk on.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,
unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an
even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his
hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a
mannerism of his father's.
Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always
with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands
there, waiting.

EXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A
tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she
is nervous and frightened.

			ROSE 
	Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to
	live with you and your family.

Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,
Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another
little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the
steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.
He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his
expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

			ROSE (CONT'D)
	What's your name? What do they call
	you?

Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child
after all.

			BUDDY 
	Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.

			ROSE 
		(greatly reassured, a real
		 smile now)
	Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice
	name, I like it. I am real pleased
	to meet you. 
		(solemnly holds out her
		 hand, they shake)
	Hey, look, do you think you got a
	cold drink of ice water somewhere?

			BUDDY
	Sure. Let me take your suitcase.

A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little
twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are
not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes
boys and men.

			ROSE 
	You're sweet.

INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris
chair in her bedroom study.

MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly
eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a
Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment
Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history
books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She
is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a
bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room.
The CAMERA pulls back to include him.

			BUDDY 
	The new girl is here.

			MOTHER 
	Wonderful. What's she like,
	Brother? What is your impression of
	her?

			BUDDY 
	She talks a great deal and smiles a
	lot. She's very pretty, she has a
	real good figure. She's very
	girlish or womanish, if you know
	what I mean. She wouldn't hurt
	anybody, this girl. She couldn't.

Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as
perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.

			MOTHER 
	Your impression is very reassuring,
	Brother. Of course she's had
	troubles, poor thing, but I sensed
	that was that the girl was like and
	I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

			BUDDY 
	You mean confirmed, Mother. I
	didn't confirm it before. I would
	have had to confirm it previously,
	in order for it to be reconfirmed.

			MOTHER 
	All right, all right. Doll and
	Waski are upstairs taking their
	nap, you go get them and bring them
	down to the living room. Where is
	the girl?

			BUDDY 
	In the kitchen drinking all the ice
	water in Glenville. She walked out
	here, she didn't go by the hotel.

			MOTHER 
	Walked, in all that heat? It's a
	wonder she hasn't got sunstroke.
	I'll phone Daddy and you go get
	Doll Baby and Waski.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM

A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living
room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl
of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle,
very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own
children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than
offensive.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, this is Waski. His real name
	is Warren but we call him Waski. He
	doesn't like it much and I suppose
	someday we'll have to stop calling
	him that.

			WASKI
	You can stop it right now.

			MOTHER 
	When he was baby we called him "Wa
	Wa," a baby name, you know. You
	will find him a very good boy. His
	brother can be bad and so can his
	sister, but Waski is a very good
	boy. And as you can see he's
	beautiful.

			WASKI 
	Oh, Mother, cut it out.

			MOTHER 
		(serenely)
	There are plenty of girls who would
	give thousands of dollars to have
	your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty
	and that's all there is to it.
	Beauty is there and we have to
	recognize it. Now Rose, the little
	girl sitting across from you with
	the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She
	looks like an angel and she is an
	angel, but she can be a naughty
	angel sometimes, although her
	father won't believe it. Her real
	name is Frances, but we call her
	Dolly or Doll.

			DOLL 
	I don't like that, either, it's
	worse than Waski. I want to be
	called Fran.

			MOTHER 
	Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the
	redhaired boy you see sitting
	there, of course you have met him,
	he is my oldest son and my most
	brilliant child. All children have
	great creative powers, but I don't
	want to rattle on about my
	children, they say I brag too much
	about them, especially about
	Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?

Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is
staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.

			ROSE 
		(feebly)
	Oh, no, ma'am.

			MOTHER 
	Well, it's rather interesting about
	Brother, actually. I realized the
	remarkable thing he had when he was
	six weeks old. He looked at me and
	understood me, he knew exactly who
	I was. I know it sounds crazy but
	it's true. He's very remarkable, he
	was born for the ministry and could
	move millions, but he doesn't know
	that yet. I have to warn you about
	him, he can be very dangerous,
	there is an evil streak in him, a
	streak of pure sheer meanness. But
	at heart Brother is saintly and
	that is why he was born for the
	ministry even if he doesn't know
	it.

Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with
reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and
very, very gentle and kind.
Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her
long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in
speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.

The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips,
swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous.
Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine
VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer,
Buddy's father.

			DADDY'S VOICE 
	Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out
	of the girl going into the fourth
	dimension like that.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He
is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner
all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and
funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern
dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a
comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the
characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where
Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on
the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the
back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his
hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what
seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude
really is inscrutable.

			MOTHER 
	It isn't the fourth dimension. To
	you it's the fourth dimension,
	maybe, to me it's simply the truth.

			DADDY 
		(staring fiercely at Rose)
	Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud
	has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all
	assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un
	hmmm.

Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious
he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually
as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her
knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she
has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of
him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair
beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins
a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no
clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	Well, Rosebud, now you are here,
	darling, and I swear to God
	graceful as the capital letter S.
	You will adorn our house, Rosebud,
	you will give a glow and a shine to
	these old walls. If there's one
	thing I like to have around, it's a
	frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume
	Mrs. Hillyer and the children have
	introduced themselves and made your
	acquaintance, and so forth and so
	on?

Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on
him, a half whisper.

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

			DADDY 
	All right. Now as head of this
	household I have a couple of
	remarks to make. It is my dear
	wife's belief, which I accept
	although I do not totally grasp it,
	that to hire a person to do
	household work is a criminal
	practice. Therefore, you are here
	not as a servant, you are here as a
	friend, as a guest and hopefully as
	a member of this family. You will
	eat your meals with us, you will
	share life itself with us -- in
	love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in
	love and harmony. Do you understand
	me?

			ROSE
		(a half whisper)
	Yes, sir.

Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness
and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes
begin to well with tears.

			DADDY 
	Now, I know you've had some
	troubles in your life, those...
	scoundrels in Birmingham and so
	forth trying to... lead you astray.
	I hope you find a safe haven here,
	honey, I know you've had a hard
	time. Life can be cruel to a young
	girl all alone. We welcome you to
	our home, Rosebud, we all welcome
	you from the heart and hope you are
	happy here.

Rose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an
inaudible whisper.

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

INT. HILLYER HOME

VARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the
floor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work,
smiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she
is happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is
apparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new
home.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose is washing the dishes while the children finish
breakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a
slightly sly expression.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, who were those scoundrels in
	Birmingham?

			ROSE 
	Nobody.

			BUDDY 
	But who were they?

			ROSE 
	They were just bad men, that's all.

			BUDDY 
	In what sense were they bad?

			ROSE 
	Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no
	sense to it.

			BUDDY 
	Did they try to induce you to
	become a prostitute?

Rose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the
dishcloth.

			ROSE 
	I don't answer talk like that,
	Buddy. I just don't hear it, I turn
	my back and look away.

Rose turns her back on him.

			BUDDY 
	Was that what they tried to do? Was
	that why Daddy gave you the job, to
	save you from those scoundrels?

			ROSE 
	Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll
	say that. He's the best and most
	kind-hearted man in the world.

			BUDDY 
	Hey, Rose, did you hear about that
	terrible thing down in Cave
	Springs?

			ROSE 
	What terrible thing in Cave
	Springs?

			BUDDY 
	There was this old man that ate his
	niece.

Rose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips
together.

			ROSE 
	I didn't hear you. I didn't hear
	that.

			BUDDY 
	He really did, he ate his little
	niece. He made pork chops out of
	her.

			ROSE 
	I don't hear you. I just turn my
	back on that kind of talk and look
	away.

			BUDDY 
	Well, it's only the truth. There
	are horrible things in the world,
	Rose.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, you are in one of your evil
	moods, I don't want to talk to you.
	I'm going out and sweep the patio.

Rose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski.

			BUDDY 
	Rose is almost as sentimental as
	Mother. If there's one thing I
	can't stand it's sentimentality. In
	Chattanooga this man committed an
	almost perfect murder. He killed
	his wife with a black widow spider.

			DOLL 
	Oh, shut up, Buddy.

			WASKI 
	Yeah, shut up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer
house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and
crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The
CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,
Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the
patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down
curiously at her.

			ROSE 
	What are you studying now, Mrs.
	Hillyer?

			MOTHER 
	More history, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Are you going to get your degree
	soon?

			MOTHER 
	Well, I am working on my thesis.

			ROSE 
		(as she busily sweeps)
	It must be wonderful to be so
	smart. I don't see how you do it,
	reading all those books, learning
	all that stuff.

			MOTHER 
		(looks up, and gently)
	Rose, you work too hard. Why don't
	you go sit down somewhere and drink
	a Co-Cola?

			ROSE 
		(smiles, trusts and knows
		 Mother now, not at all
		 afraid of her)
	You're so sweet.

Rose again busily sweeps.

			MOTHER 
	Really, why don't you go sit down
	somewhere?

			ROSE 
	I like to work. I don't mind work.
	It's the least I can do after all
	you and Mr. Hillyer have done for
	me. 
		(stares worshipfully at
		 Mother)
	You're so sweet. There never was
	nobody like you.

			MOTHER 
		(gently)
	Well, you run on now.

			ROSE 
	Yes, Ma'am.

Exit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of
a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound
of an approaching CAR and she glances up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a slightly worn-out 1932 Model-A Ford as it
rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the
wheel.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has
his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio.

			DADDY 
	Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful
	day.

			MOTHER 
	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd
	work outside.

			DADDY 
	How goes it, darlin'?

			MOTHER 
	Slow, hon. But at least I can
	concentrate now that Rose is here.

			DADDY 
	What do you think of her, honey?

Mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her
notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and
hear from it a faint BUZZ.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	Turn up your hearing aid.

			MOTHER 
	What?

			DADDY 
	Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at
	me like a snake.

			MOTHER
		(adjusts hearing aid)
	Oh. Did you say something?

			DADDY 
	I asked you what you think of
	Rosebud, now that she's been here a
	while.

			MOTHER 
	Honey, she's perfect. She works all
	the time and she's wonderful with
	the children. And they love her,
	even Brother likes her though he
	won't admit it. I think she's just
	perfect.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.

			MOTHER 
	And she's such a good-hearted
	thing, there isn't an ounce of harm
	or malice in her.

			DADDY 
	Well, I'll admit I don't see any
	flies on her yet.

			MOTHER 
	There are no flies on Rose, I don't
	know what you're talking about.

			DADDY 
	Well, she must have done something
	to encourage those scoundrels in
	Birmingham, even if she did run
	away from them.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the window of the kitchen. He is
propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the
talk on the patio. We hear the VOICES of his parents OVER the
shot.

			MOTHER'S VOICE 
	If you mean... boys and men, I
	don't think so. Rose seems very
	calm about all of that.

			DADDY'S VOICE 
	Well, so far I have to agree. She
	seems calm as lettuce.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he draws back into the kitchen.
We see Doll and Waski playing a game on the kitchen table.

			BUDDY 
	Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce.
	Do you believe that, Doll?

			DOLL 
	No.

			WASKI 
	Neither do I.

			BUDDY 
	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what
	we're talking about.

			WASKI
	I do, too.

Buddy turns, looks back out the window.

EXT. HILLYER SOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy on the patio. Daddy stands up.

			DADDY 
	Well, let's hope for the best,
	darlin'.

			MOTHER 
	Hope for the best? I don't
	understand all this skepticism. I
	thought you liked Rose.

			DADDY 
	I love Rosebud, I am wild about
	Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't
	turn out to be a hidden hotcha
	character, that's all. We have
	growing children in the house.

			MOTHER 
	Hotcha character. If I had to live
	with your cynicism, I wouldn't want
	to live at all. What you can't
	understand is that the creative
	forces of the universe are
	positive, not negative.

			DADDY
		(gently, his irony is
		 mild)
	All right, darlin', don't go off
	into the fourth dimension.

			MOTHER 
	I'm not in the fourth dimension --
		(points a finger at him)
	-- you are in the fourth dimension,
	when you allow skepticism and doubt
	to take control. As Blake said, if
	God had doubt the sun would go out.

			DADDY 
		(again gentle irony,
		 always courtly toward
		 her)
	Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I
	don't understand these deeper
	things the way you do.

			MOTHER 
		(reaches up, takes his
		 hand)
	Be nice to Rose. She's never had a
	real home.

			DADDY 
	You're a wonderful woman, darlin'.
	As long as you're around, I'm sure
	the sun wouldn't dare go out.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the kitchen.
Doll and Waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table.
Buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls
across the kitchen, hands in his khaki pants.

			BUDDY 
	It's pitiful. Neither one of them
	know.

			DOLL 
		(as she shakes dice)
	I think Daddy suspects.

			BUDDY 
	No, he doesn't. Not really.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he goes to the hall door,
carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose busy dusting hall furniture,
humming as she works. We hear on the track the SOUND of the
Model-A starting, and Rose freezes. Then, quickly, Rose
hurries down the hall toward the front door.

ON Buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. He
has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his face is
expressionless.

ANOTHER ANGLE, POV of Buddy but CLOSER on Rose at the end of
the hall. She is staring soulfully through the glass of the
front door as we hear the Model-A go down the driveway. Rose
lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. A lovesick
expression is on her face.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

ON Buddy, as he comes back into the kitchen sadly shaking his
head.

			BUDDY
	It's really pitiful. She's in bad
	shape.

			DOLL
	She's watching the car again?

			BUDDY
	Yeah.

			DOLL
	I get so irritated with Daddy. He's
	so dumb sometimes.

			WASKI
	Yeah, I know.

			BUDDY
	Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.

			WASKI
	I do, too!

			BUDDY
	All right, what do you know?

			WASKI
	Rose is madly in love with Daddy...

			DOLL
		(pauses, then solemnly)
	Well, don't tell Mother.

			WASKI
	Do you think I'm crazy?

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night.
Daddy is at the head of the table, Mother is at the other
end.

Buddy, Doll and Waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes,
hands washed and hair combed. Rose is serving, but a place is
set for her. She wears an attractive little apron and is
smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her.

			DADDY
	(in a good humor) 
	Rosebaby Blossom, these are the
	most delicious candied yams I ever
	ate! Why, they just melt in my
	mouth. And this fried chicken is
	fit for a king. How do you do it,
	Peachbird? What is the secret of
	your art, Plum Blossom, huh?

			ROSE
		(blushing, smiling)
	Oh, I don't know, I... I...

			DADDY 
	Rosebird Baby, you are the light of
	my life, darlin'. How did we ever
	get by without you?

			ROSE 
		(stares at him, stricken)
	I... I'll get the grits.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Rose as she exits, and STOPS on Buddy and
Doll. Buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his
gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. The CAMERA
MOVES on to Mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything
going on between Rose and Daddy.

			MOTHER 
	Rose does have a gift for cooking.
	She learns so fast, but mainly I
	think it's that she tries so hard.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is
seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her
food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly
unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the
children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a
biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

			MOTHER
		(gently, suspects
		 absolutely nothing)
	Rose, you're in an awful dither
	tonight. What's the matter with
	you, honey, are you sick or
	something?

			ROSE
		(in a feeble voice)
	No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

			MOTHER 
	You look sick if you ask me. I hate
	to leave you with the dishes and
	all, but I'm supposed to go to a
	meeting of the Garden Club this
	evening.
		(to Daddy)
	I'll need the car keys.

			DADDY 
	I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got
	no business behind the wheel of an
	automobile. You don't think about
	what you're doing and you'll run
	into a telephone pole.

			MOTHER 
	I think about what I'm doing all
	the time, and I've got as much
	business behind the wheel of an
	automobile as anybody. Besides, I
	want you to stay and help Rose with
	the dishes, the poor girl isn't
	feeling well.

			DADDY 
	All right, darlin'.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

A shot of Daddy alone in the dining room, reading a newspaper
and drinking coffee. Rose comes INTO THE PICTURE, gets dishes
as she clears the table. She stares with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is absorbed in paper.

			DADDY
		(to himself, mostly)
	Hmmp. Did you realize there are a
	thousand Coca-Cola millionaires in
	Atlanta?

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll tiptoeing down the darkened
hall toward the front door. We hear the MODEL-A going down
the drive. They peer out of the glass of the front door. They
whisper.

			BUDDY
	There goes Mother.

			DOLL
	Yeah.

			BUDDY 
	Let's go peep from the living room.

			DOLL
	Okay.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe into the darkened
living room. They go over to the sliding doors and silently
struggle for the best peeping spot. Buddy gets up high, Doll
down low, at the crack in the doors through which light
shines.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of the dining room, as seen by children.
Daddy sits absorbed in his paper, oblivious of Rose. She is
staring down at him with a pale look of love.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE-UP of Buddy and Doll, their heads together.
They whisper.

			DOLL
	I think she's gonna kiss him.

			BUDDY
	At least.

INT. HILLYER HOME DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as seen by children. The
table now is cleared and Rose stands half behind Daddy,
staring down at him with a stricken expression.

			DADDY 
		(half to himself)
	Ehh, Lord, should have bought that
	stock when we had some money. A
	thousand millionaires.

Rose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his
shoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm
around his neck.

			ROSE 
	Oh, oh! Oh, Mr. Hillyer, I love
	you, I love you so much! I've
	tried, but I can't help it! Please
	kiss me -- will you kiss me?

For a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half
frown as if he can't believe it. In order to stare at her, he
must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he
looks a bit like a startled rooster. Her breasts are pressed
against him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.

			DADDY 
		(finally clears his
		 throat)
	Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap.
	What are you doing, girl? Are you
	crazy?

			ROSE
	Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr.
	Hillyer!

			DADDY 
	Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you
	crazy girl. Now I'm telling you
	again, get off my lap. Come on,
	Rose, get up. Now you get up, I
	say, and stop this!

			ROSE 
	No, no! You don't understand, I
	love you! It's real love and I
	can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr.
	Hillyer, I love you, I love you so
	much...

Rose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder.
She has her arms wound tight around him and Daddy seems at a
loss what to do.

			DADDY
		(in a shaken voice)
	All right, all right. Now calm
	down, Rose, the children will hear
	you. Calm down, let's talk... about
	this thing, let's discuss it.

			ROSE
		(sobbing)
	Don't make me... me... me... get
	up!

	Calm down, Rose, let's calm down
	and discuss it ...

INT. HILLYER HOKE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll. Doll is down near the floor
and can't see as well. They whisper.

			DOLL 
	I can't see. What are they doing,
	what's happening?

			BUDDY 
	They're discussing it.

			DOLL 
	I can't see, let me see...

Doll tries to rise up and Buddy puts a hand on her head and
shoves her down.

			BUDDY 
	This is my place and you can't have
	it.

			DOLL
		(a whispered moan of
		 frustration)
	Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?

			BUDDY
		(his eyes open wide)
	He's trying to get up -- good God,
	one of her titties is out!

			DOLL 
	Let me see!

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as he struggles to rise
from the chair. They are half falling to the floor and now
they fall, Rose still on his lap. One of her breasts has come
out of her dress, which is very loose and low-cut. She has no
bra, the breast is bare. Daddy is staring groggily at the
breast as if slightly dazed.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO Buddy and Doll. Buddy is frustrated now.

			BUDDY 
	Now I can't see. What are they
	doing?

			DOLL 
		(happy, peeping through
		 crack)
	Boy! Wow!

Buddy groans and peers intently through crack.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A POV shot of scene as observed by Buddy. He is up too high,
the dining table blocks his view. We see the lower half of
Rose and Daddy. Rose's skirt is up well above her knees.

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll.

			DOLL 
	Wow! Brrrother!

			BUDDY 
	What are they doing?

			DOLL 
	Buddy, this is amazing, you
	wouldn't believe it.

			BUDDY 
	What are they doing, Doll?

			DOLL 
		(staring, enthralled)
	He kissed her.

			BUDDY
	Is that all?

			DOLL 
		(happily, enjoying it)
	He had his hand on her titty.

			BUDDY 
	Let me look.

		 around waist and pulls
		 her away; eagerly looks,
		 sags)
	Aww-rr...

CUT TO a POV shot of the scene in the dining room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

DOWN LOW, we can see under the dining room table now. Daddy
has his hands on Rose's shoulders and is firmly pushing her
away.

			DADDY
	All right, that is enough of this
	nonsense, and I mean enough! Get up
	off this floor, Rose, and put your
	damned tit back in your dress! Do
	you hear me, girl, get up off of
	that floor!

Rose, on all fours, blonde hair over her face, making little
whimpering noises of dismay:

			ROSE
	Ohh-hhh... ohh...

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll.

			BUDDY 
		(disappointed)
	She's putting the titty back.

			DOLL 
		(a furious whisper)
	Buddy, that was my place.

Doll forces her way in and they both peep through crack in
door.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose and Daddy. Rose stands sheepishly
by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her
dress. Daddy sits in his dining room chair. Daddy is glaring
at her.

			DADDY 
	Goddamn you, girl! You've made me
	make a fool out of myself, damn
	your hide, but let me tell you I am
	standing at the pass of Thermopylae
	and I won't budge! The very idea,
	my own home with children in the
	house, to say nothing of my wife --
	oh-h, you had better believe I am
	standing at Thermopylae, you little
	nut, you had better believe it!
	What are you, crazy? A man is
	supposed to be a fool like this,
	but a woman is supposed to have
	some control and sense! Are you a
	nitwit? What's the matter with you?

			ROSE 
		(weeping)
	Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr.
	Hillyer... I just... couldn't help
	myself. I'm sorry...

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they peep at the door.
Doll whispers angrily at him.

			DOLL 
	Buddy, that was pretty snotty of
	you, pushing me away like that just
	when it was interesting.

			BUDDY 
	You shouldn't watch such things,
	Doll.

They continue to peep with interest through the crack in the
doors.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Daddy. Now Rose is sitting penitent
and crying in one of Daddy's handkerchiefs. Daddy's anger is
gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now
in a different tone.

He sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly
way.

			DADDY 
	Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor
	miserable little child, don't you
	know I love you? Do I have to put
	my hand on your body or kiss your
	pretty lips to prove it? You are
	beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved
	you since you first came here,
	darlin'. And don't you know Mrs.
	Hillyer loves you, too, that she's
	already taken you into her heart,
	and that that woman's heart is as
	wide as the blue sky itself and as
	deep as the stars?

			ROSE 
		(weeping in handkerchief)
	Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's
	been so good to me...

			DADDY 
	Do you know what a friend you have
	got there? Do you know she would
	fight for you like a tiger, that
	she would fly to your defense in an
	instant with all the courage in her
	soul if anyone tried to hurt you?
	Is this any way to repay her trust
	and love? Are you ashamed as I am
	ashamed? 
		(pauses as Rose sobs in
		 handkerchief)
	Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But
	let me warn you, damn your hide,
	this is Thermopylae and I am
	standing here. Do you hear me, damn
	you. I am standing at Thermopylae
	and the Persians shall not pass!
	Now get your tail out of here and
	go wash those dishes, and stop
	crying!

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll in the darkened living room. He
gestures that they'd better leave, and they do. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe out of the living room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STAIRS - NIGHT

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy and Doll as they tiptoe up the front
stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT

ON Buddy and Doll at the top of the stairs. They pause to
talk and now they don't have to whisper. Doll is happy,
pleased.

			DOLL 
	Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted
	to kiss her some more and play with
	her, but he didn't, because he
	loves Mother and all of us, and he
	loves Rose, too. Isn't he
	wonderful, isn't he great?

			BUDDY 
		(dryly, aloof; he doesn't
		 mean this really)
	Wonderful? He kissed her and played
	with her titty, and I don't see
	anything so great about that. He
	was probably afraid Mother would
	come back early and catch him.

			DOLL 
	You know, Buddy, sometimes you make
	me sick.

Doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. The CAMERA
STAYS on Buddy as he stares after her with a thin little
smile. Be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.
After a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of
downstairs and his face changes. His smile fades, then slowly
returns as he thinks of what has happened.

			BUDDY 
		(quietly, to himself)
	Thermopylae. The Persians shall not
	pass.

It is obvious that secretly Buddy admires very much his
father's behavior.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.

He wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes
midway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is
finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old
fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He
looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his
bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a
small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.

CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall
title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND
DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers
Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the
shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a
glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing
maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth
going, "Tee-Hee!"

ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the
Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to
the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the
bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the
flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a
faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the
covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and
throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on
pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his
room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The
shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over
his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half
crying.

			ROSE 
	Buddy... are you asleep?

ANOTHER ANGLE, on both of them. Buddy stares at her in
surprise. It is dim in the room, but we can see them in the
moonlight.

			BUDDY
	No, I'm awake. What's the matter?

			ROSE 
	Buddy, I am wandering in a
	wilderness, lost. 
		(sits glumly on edge of
		 bed)
	I just feel awful. Do you mind if I
	get in bed with you for a little
	while?

			BUDDY 
	Well, all right.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed in the moonlight.
It is all innocent enough, Buddy is a child and Rose
obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. She
lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a
cigarette.

			ROSE 
	I thought I'd go crazy back there
	in that room all by myself with
	nobody to talk to. As a child, I
	never had no room all to myself, we
	were awful poor. Buddy... I have
	got a confession to make.

			BUDDY 
	What is it, Rose?

			ROSE 
	It's so terrible I can't tell you.
	Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it
	hurts to have a broken heart, what
	a terrible feeling it is, and I've
	had a broken heart so many times.
	Men, I don't understand them, I
	can't figure them out and they
	break my heart, that's all. I can't
	find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find
	him no matter how hard I look, all
	I find is a whole pile of Mr.
	Wrongs. But this is the worst ever
	because it wasn't his fault. It was
	my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was
	bad -- oh God, I was bad, you
	wouldn't believe how bad I was.

			BUDDY 
		(a little smile)
	What'd you do, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell
	you who it was, but do you know
	what I did? I sat on his lap and
	got ahold of him and wiggled and
	wiggled my ass on him and was
	worse'n you could know, a child
	like you. Why, I let one of my tits
	fall out deliberate on purpose and
	practically smack him in the face
	with it and I let my dern skirt
	come up so he could see my
	drawers... 
		(pauses, realizes this
		 isn't too dignified)
	But to get back serious to what I
	was sayin', it is not only, Buddy,
	the loss of him but my own bad
	behavior what bothers me so...

			BUDDY 
	You were pretty bad, huh?

			ROSE 
	Why, it has just made me ill,
	Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to
	eat nothin', I don't, and me I got
	a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral
	for me. I'm ill.

			BUDDY
		(slyly, pretends he
		 doesn't know)
	But, Rose, what is the cause of it
	all?

			ROSE
	Promise not to tell Doll? -- or
	nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm
	so much in love with him I am out
	of my mind!

			BUDDY
	But, Rose, how could such a thing
	as that happen?

			ROSE
	I fell madly in love with him when
	he called me Rosebud. You know that
	first day when I come and he said I
	looked graceful like a capital
	letter S and called me Rosebud? I
	fell madly in love with that man
	right then.
		(sighs tragically)
	But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a
	good man and won't have nothin' to
	do with me.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has
propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the
moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the
open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself
conscious with him.

			BUDDY 
		(casually)
	Can I touch you here?

Before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger
through her nightgown.

			BUDDY (CONT'D)
	Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

			ROSE 
		(casually, doesn't object)
	What did you expect?

			BUDDY 
	Well, I thought they were more like
	a cantaloupe.

			ROSE 
	Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a
	cantaloupe.

			BUDDY 
		(touches her breast more
		 boldly, his hand outside
		 the nightgown)
	There's some kind of gristle in it,
	though.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, quit that, you're just a
	child, you're not supposed to be
	interested in such things.

			BUDDY 
	Actually, I am, though.

			ROSE 
		(dreamily, thinking of
		 Daddy as she smokes
		 cigarette and stares up
		 at the ceiling)
	You know, that Daddy of yours is
	the funniest man, the things he
	says, you never know what's going
	to come out of his mouth next.

			BUDDY
	Can I put my hand inside your
	nightgown, Rose?

			ROSE 
	No, you can't. And I'll tell you
	this -- he scares me. As kind as he
	is, he scares me. You can't fool
	around with him, not with that man.
	And, boy, I sure better not try
	nothin' like that with him again,
	he'll fire me.

			BUDDY
	Rose, can't I see what the nipple
	on it is like?

			ROSE
		(frowns)
	Buddy, what's come over you? A
	child like you, askin' such things.

			BUDDY
	But I'm curious, Rose.

Puts his hand in her nightgown.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit
	it, get you hand away...

Takes his wrist.

			BUDDY 
	Just for a second. Please, Rose,
	what's the harm?

			ROSE 
		(gently)
	Buddy, you don't realize it but
	what you're doing isn't nice.

			BUDDY 
	Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see
	what the nipple on it is like.

			ROSE 
	You don' t need to know that. It's
	none of your business.

			BUDDY 
	Aw, be a good sport, Rose. 
		(sweetly, almost sugarily)
	You like me, don't you? I like you
	a lot.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We
see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly
out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in
the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in
the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet
talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in
her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on
Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.
Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

			ROSE 
	Well, are you satisfied now? Can we
	just lie and talk, huh?

			BUDDY 
	Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

			ROSE 
	'Course it does.

			BUDDY 
	First I couldn't feel it, but now I
	feel it easily, it's like a little
	acorn.

			ROSE 
		(moistens her lips,
		 swallows; it is affecting
		 her; she frowns)
	All right, that's enough. 
		(firmly pushes his hand
		 away)
	You're just a child and wouldn't
	understand it, but that type of
	thing can stir a girl up. Now lie
	back and we'll talk.

			BUDDY 
	That was very interesting. Thank
	you, Rose.

			ROSE 
		(lighting cigarette)
	Don't mention it.

			BUDDY
		(pensively, with the
		 solemn pedanticness of a
		 precocious child)
	It was softer'n I thought, that was
	my main impression. You know, if
	you hit a girl there it would hurt
	her a lot.

			ROSE 
	Who would want to do such a thing
	as that?

			BUDDY 
	Well, some fiend might.

			ROSE 
		(stares wonderingly at
		 him)
	You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't
	figure you out at all. You can be
	very nice, but like your mother
	said there's an evil streak in you.

			BUDDY 
	There's an evil streak in
	everybody, Rose.

			ROSE 
	There ain't none in your Daddy. You
	know, what happened has just made
	me love him all the more. I not
	only love him, I respect him, I
	admire him.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, I have a serious favor to ask
	you.

			ROSE 
	Most men wouldn't do what he done.
	If they can get a girl they go
	right ahead and get her -- I guess
	to hell they do, just like a dern
	rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell
	her she's no good when they done
	the same thing their selves.
	They're a bunch of monkeys. I like
	'em, but they're a bunch of
	monkeys.

			BUDDY 
		(trying to be casual)
	Rose, since you're here in bed with
	me and everything and I've already
	touched your titty...

Can't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we
don't hear what he says.

			ROSE 
		(her eyes open wide as he
		 whispers)
	Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What
	an awful thing to say, and where
	did you get any such idea as that,
	anyhow?

			BUDDY 
	I'm curious to see what it's like.
	I'm very curious, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Well, now that is just too bad!
	Curiosity killed the cat.

			BUDDY 
	Yeah, but satisfaction brought him
	back. Can I?

			ROSE 
	No! You ought to be ashamed of
	yourself astin' such a nasty things
	a child your age!

			BUDDY
	Can't I touch it a little, Rose --
	not a lot, just a little?

			ROSE 
	Of course you can't! I'm... I'm
	shocked at you, Buddy, real
	shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm
	going back to my own bed!

			BUDDY
	Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's
	all, I have a natural curiosity,
	it's only human. You're my friend,
	aren't you? Don't you like me? 
		(again sweetly, almost
		 sugarily)
	I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact,
	I love you.

			ROSE 
		(softens despite herself)
	Well, you're sweet, but you don't
	really love me.

			BUDDY 
	Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good
	sport.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, you're just a child.

			BUDDY 
	I'm thirteen. And I have a natural
	curiosity. It's only nature, Rose,
	that's all. Now what's wrong with
	nature, huh?

			ROSE 
	Well, nothin'.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in
pajamas. He looks frowzle-haired and glum. The CAMERA FOLLOWS
him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the
moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau. Be
glances over his shoulder as we hear Mother.

			MOTHER 
	What's the matter, hon? Is anything
	wrong?

			DADDY 
	No, darlin'. Just that damnable
	insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a
	baby for an hour then I'm wide
	awake. You go back to sleep.

Daddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares
out at the moonlit night.

The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER on his face and we see a weariness
and strain he has not shown before.

			DADDY 
	The Depression has got me. That
	miserable hotel, no money anywhere,
	strong men out of work, children
	hungry. It's a great life if you
	don't weaken.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has
weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can
only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders
and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A
different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she
is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely
haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble
voice.

			ROSE 
	You better quit that.

			BUDDY 
	But Rose...

			ROSE 
	I must be outta my mind. Buddy,
	quit it.

			BUDDY 
	Am I hurting you?

			ROSE 
		(pauses, stares off as if
		 listening, then in an
		 even feebler tone, a half
		 whisper)
	No. No, you're not hurting me. 
		(moistens her lips,
		 swallows)
	But I think you better quit it.

			BUDDY 
	But why, if I'm not hurting you?

			ROSE 
	You wouldn't understand.
		(puts a hand on his
		 shoulder as if to push
		 him away, but can't; puts
		 her other hand over her
		 eyes)
	Oh, God, I must be outta my mind.
	What would your Momma think?

The hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head
to the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there
as the boy fiddles with her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a
bathrobe and slippers. He looks very frowzled and sleepy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

ON Daddy as he walks into the kitchen, turns on the light. He
goes to the ice box, an old-fashioned type made of wood that
takes cakes of ice. Be pours out a glass of milk.

INT. HILLYER ROME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a very CLOSE SHOT on Rose's face. The light is dim but
we see perspiration on her forehead. Her breathing is not
normal. Her eyes are shut tight, her teeth are clenched.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy. We do not see what he is doing,
but evidently he is fiddling with her. He seems quite
interested in the proceedings.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, beyond a doubt this is the
	most fascinating experience of my
	life.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather
gloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass Of milk.

			DADDY 
		(to himself)
	Ehh-hh, Lord, man born of woman
	hath few days and they are full of
	trouble.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot close on Rose ai Buddy in the bed. The shot is
of their heads and shoulders.
She has an arm very tight around his shoulders and her eyes
are shut tight. The moment of truth is at hand.

			ROSE 
	Ohh-hh! Ohhh-hh! 
		(it's all over; she twists
		 sideways, puts both arms
		 around him)
	Oh, Buddy, you're so sweet. I love
	you a lot.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy as he washes out the glass in the
sink.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy in the bed. The extremity of
her crime has dawned on Rose and she is sitting up in the bed
with a look of horror on her face. Buddy is staring worriedly
at her.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, are you all right? Are you
	sick or something?

			ROSE 
		(staring off in space,
		 lost in horror)
	No. No, I'm all right. 
		(turns, stares at him,
		 puts a hand in woe on her
		 forehead)
	Oh, God, what have I done? I have
	robbed a cradle and fallen into
	hell!
		(fumbles desperately on
		 bed for cigarettes)
	I must be crazy, a child like you.
	Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful,
	this is terrible, I gotta get outta
	here!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out
of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward
the door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought
occurs to her.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,
	would you?

			BUDDY 
		(a trifle too piously)
	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a
	soul.

			ROSE 
	I sure hope you don't.
		(still in a panic)
	I gotta get outta here, good night.

			BUDDY 
		(sweetly)
	Good night, Rose.

INT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in
his bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the
upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks
and he looks up and sees her.

			DADDY 
	Rose, what are you doing up?

			ROSE 
	Nothin', just goin' to the
	bathroom.

			DADDY 
	Is anything wrong?

			ROSE 
	No, sir.

			DADDY 
	Well, good night.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for
her the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the
nightgown, she looks as if she might faint.

			ROSE 
	Good night.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the
hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom.
Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind
her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.
The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With
trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty
pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.
Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has
not turned on the light in her room and her considerable
charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.
Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own
reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible
realization.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is
blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The
shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy
and an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark
recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,
murky, cobwebby.

			BUDDY 
	Wait till you hear what happened!
	Now you wont believe this, Doll,
	but Rose came in my room and got in
	my bed last night...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his
child's face a sinister look. Now he has "Dracula" teeth and
evil arched eyebrows.

			BUDDY (CONT'D)
	... and she sweated and snorted
	like a horse and had a horrible
	fit, her eyebrows were all
	scrunched up and she groaned like
	she was eying and foamed at the
	mouth!

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose standing horrified before the mirror.
The match is still burning in her fingers.

							QUICK CUT TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY

A shot of Mother in her study, a worried Doll stands before
her. The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash
of fantasy.

			MOTHER 
	Yes, dear, what is it?

			DOLL 
	Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his
	bed last night and he fiddled with
	her and she snorted and had a fit --
	and he says I would too if I was
	grown-up. Is it true, Mother --
	would I sweat and snort and froth
	at the mouth and have a horrible
	fit like he says?

Mother stares in consternation at Doll.

							QUICK CUT TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

A shot of Daddy and Rose on the front porch of the house. The
scene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.
Daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down
the driveway. A weeping, slumped Rose sadly walks down the
steps carrying her cardboard suitcase. Fantasy.

			DADDY 
	Out! Out, you viper in the grass!
	Out! Never darken our doorstep, you
	immoral, terrible girl!

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Rose standing before the mirror, sick with
horror. A feeble whimper-like groan comes from her.

			ROSE
	Ohh-hh, ohhh-hh... 
		(match burns her fingers,
		 she shakes it out)
	Ouch! Oh-hh... ohh...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she turns from the bureau and stares
off into space, a very badly frightened girl. Half-crying,
she speaks to herself.

			ROSE (CONT'D)
	He'll tell 'em for sure, he will.
	Oh, Lord, what can I do?

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the
lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The
CAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing
by his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.

			ROSE 
	I hate to turn on this light, you
	Daddy's awake downstairs, but I
	have to take the chance.
		(sits by him on bed)
	Buddy, please don't tell on me.

			BUDDY
		(rather coolly)
	I said I wouldn't. 

			ROSE
		(her lip trembles)
	Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as
	I've been please have pity on me
	and don't ruin me by telling them
	what I did. I know it was bad, it
	was bad and dumb. But mostly it was
	dumb, I didn't mean you no harm,
	I'd never want to hurt a hair on
	your head and that's the truth. I
	love you. But they'd think I did,
	they'd think I was awful, they'd
	despise me and hate me...

Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose
weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's
heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it
yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool"
and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips,
swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene
with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at
Thermopylae, he shrugs.

			BUDDY 
	Well, I don't know what you're
	worried about. It was my idea, I
	was the one who thought of it, not
	you.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the
boy with hopeless despair.

			ROSE 
	You don't understand. They'd blame
	me, not you. And they'd think I was
	awful, a disgustin' girl, which I
	am, but Buddy, please don't tell
	them. Please don't. Ill have to go
	and I love it here, I love your
	whole fam'ly, your Daddy, your
	Mother... 
		(pauses, then makes her
		 final and ultimate plea
		 in a shaking voice as
		 tears run down)
	Buddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a
	bad girl but I can't help it,
	please have pity on me and don't
	tell! Please don't, please...

Too much for Buddy, he loses his "cool." He swallows and
blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and
squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy
style.

			BUDDY 
		(very solemnly)
	Rose, they could stick splinters
	under my fingernails, and I will
	never say a word! I will never tell
	them, because... I love you!

			ROSE 
		(sees that he means it,
		 smiles in relief and
		 throws her arms around
		 him)
	Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew
	you did, knew it all the time...

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, lying in bed and staring up
sleeplessly at the ceiling. Insomnia in reverse has got him.

			DADDY 
		(a half whisper to
		 himself)
	Ehh-hh, Lord... great life if you
	don't weaken.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy. Rose is sitting on the bed
beside him and she has dried her tears and got herself in
hand.

			ROSE 
	Well, Ill tell you this. I have
	learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't
	gonna run around, but when I start
	botherin' your Daddy and worse
	robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the
	facts of life. 
		(pauses, then with firm
		 resolution)
	Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get
	myself up and go out.

			BUDDY 
		(a wee mite puzzled)
	You're going to get yourself up and
	go out?

			ROSE 
	Buddy, Mr. Right is out there
	somewhere and I'm gonna find him!

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late
morning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a
sheepish Buddy standing "on the carpet before her. The other
children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table
having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with
schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.

			MOTHER 
	Brother, when I have to wake you up
	at eleven o'clock in the morning
	you're either sick or you were up
	very late last night. 
		(points a finger at him)
	And you weren't reading Huckleberry
	Finn. I looked and its not in your
	room. Now what were you doing?

			BUDDY 
		(sheepish)
	Mother, I have to tell the truth. I
	wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I
	was reading one of those Little
	Dirty Comic Books.

			MOTHER 
		(sadly)
	Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed
	in you. You mustn't look at those
	horrible things, they degrade the
	human image.

			BROTHER 
		(hangs head)
	They're filthy, Mother.

			MOTHER 
	Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the
	most beautiful things in life, the
	creative power of the universe is
	behind it.

			BROTHER 
	I know, Mother.

			MOTHER 
	But we must respect that power, we
	must be in awe of it.

			BROTHER 
	I am in awe of it, Mother.

			MOTHER 
	I don't think you are sufficiently
	in awe of it. Get the castor oil.

			BROTHER 
		(winces, as Doll and Waski
		 happily smile)
	Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.

			MOTHER
	This isn't punishment, I don't
	believe in punishment. It's for
	your health. Obviously you're sick
	if you can act like that.

As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil
and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling
Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He
makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a
tablespoon of castor oil.

			BUDDY
		(wanly)
	Mother, cant you make it calomel
	instead of castor oil?

			MOTHER
	This is for your own good. When you
	look at negative, destructive
	things like those little filthy
	comic books, you are sick. Here,
	take this.

			BUDDY
		(he is resigned, there's
		 no way out; he makes a
		 face, swallows the castor
		 oil)
	Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!

			MOTHER 
	Stop gagging like that and putting
	on a show, and swallow it. 

			BUDDY 
	Uhhh, gahdam stuff! 

			MOTHER 
	What did you say, Brother? 

			BUDDY 
	I said ahhh-dam stuff. 

			MOTHER
	No, you didn't say that, Brother.

			BUDDY 
	Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing
	aid isn't working right. I said
	ahhh-dam stuff.

			DOLL 
	No, Mother, he's lying...

			BUDDY
	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts

			WASKI
		(happily excited,
		 stammering)
	He did lie, and... and... and
	Mother, yesterday he stole money
	out of your pocketbook!

			BUDDY
	Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat,
	or Ill kill you!

			MOTHER
	Children, children! Be quiet, all
	of you! 
		(the children at once
		 simmer down)
	The vibrations in this house are
	strange today. Where's Rose,
	anyhow?

			BUDDY
	She's getting herself up to go out.

			MOTHER 
		(frowns, adjusts hearing
		 aid)
	What'd you say, Brother?

			BUDDY 
	She's getting herself up to go out.
	I think she's coming down the hall
	now.

			MOTHER
	Oh, yes, it's Thursday. 
		(glances around at sound
		 of an opening door)
	Hello, Rose, dear... 
		(her eyes open wide as she
		 stares at Rose,
		 disconcerted; now weakly)
	... my, you're... looking pretty...

CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is
quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink
rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in
some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most
remarkable thing of all.

The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin
material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could
be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the
least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white
sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white
material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her
breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material.
It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear
of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing
suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black
patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent
leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is
on her face.

			ROSE 
	How do you like my outfit? I made
	most of it myself.

Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP
Mother.

			MOTHER 
		(smiling, slightly aghast)
	Well, it's... very gay.

We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.

			BUDDY 
	Here comes Daddy.

			ROSE 
		(staring down admiringly
		 at the outfit)
	I have a knack for designing
	clothes. But I had to buy the shoes
	and the pocketbook.

			MOTHER 
		(makes up her mind to
		 defend Rose)
	Well, I think it's charming, Rose. 
		(tactfully)
	But don't you think... ah, the
	skirt is a little tight?

			ROSE 
	Oh, no, that's the style. It's
	meant to be clinging.

We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances
around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.

CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual,
he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw
hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he
is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.

			DADDY 
	Ye gods and little fishes. What
	have you done to yourself, Rose?

ON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of
attention.

			ROSE 
	Nothin'. I got myself up, that's
	all.

			DADDY 
	Got yourself up?

			ROSE 
	Yeah. I'm goin' out.

Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at
table.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest
	outfit I ever saw in my life. You
	walk down the street like that and
	they'll put you in jail, Rose.

			MOTHER 
	Why, they won't either. She looks
	pretty. And I wish you wouldn't
	pick on the poor girl all the time.
	Don't listen to him, Rose, you look
	pretty, even beautiful.

			ROSE 
		(smiles affectionately at
		 Mother)
	You're so sweet.

			DADDY 
	If you've got time before you go
	"out," get me a half-a-cup of
	coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a
	half-a-cup.

			ROSE 
	Why, sure, always got time to get
	you a half-a-cup, and one of these
	days I'm gonna get you a whole cup
	and see what happens.

			DADDY 
		(a growl, doesn't like
		 jokes about his foibles)
	Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole
	cup, my nerves can't stand the
	caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful
	insomnia in reverse last night. Lay
	there and sweated blood for hours.

			DOLL 
		(sweetly)
	Daddy, Buddy was up late last night
	reading little dirty comic books.
	Mother gave him a dose of castor
	oil and he cursed it, he took the
	Lords name in vain, then claimed he
	hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

			MOTHER 
	You mustn't be a tattletale, dear.
	You mustn't be Delilah-ish and
	Jezebel-ish toward your brother,
	dear.

			DOLL 
	I'm only trying to help him,
	Mother.

			BUDDY 
	Heh, what a hypocrite.

			MOTHER 
		(to Daddy)
	I do wish you'd speak to Brother.
	It's true he's been looking at
	those horrible little books again.

			DADDY 
		(stares sternly at Buddy)
	Lay off of that stuff, son. It
	upsets your mother.

			MOTHER 
		(genuinely worried)
	I'm serious. We forget he's just a
	child. I wish you'd speak to him.

			DADDY 
	I'll take him with me downtown. 
		(glances at Rose as she
		 comes with coffee)
	And you, too, Rose, if you want a
	ride.

			ROSE 
	Sure, love one. Here's your half-a
	cup of coffee.

Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt.
He slowly shakes his head.

			DADDY 
	That's a pretty stylish skirt,
	Rose. The only thing I don't
	understand is how did you ever get
	it on.

			ROSE 
		(happy, pleased by his
		 interest)
	Well, it has buttons.

Points to little buttons on right side of the skirt.

			DADDY 
	How can the buttons stand the
	pressure?

			ROSE 
	There are more on the other side.

Points to buttons on left side.

			DADDY 
	Turn around, darlin'.

Happy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round,
feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin
material. Daddy slowly shakes his head.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	They'll put her in jail. The damn
	little fool might as well be naked.

			MOTHER 
		(a wee mite worried)
	Well, it is a little tight. But it
	isn't as bad as all that. No one
	will notice unless they have such
	thoughts in the first place.

			DADDY 
	Who doesn't have such thoughts? 
		(glances at wristwatch)
	We'd better get going.

			MOTHER 
	You're not having lunch?

			DADDY 
	Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never
	eat, darlin', you know that. Not
	eating and reverse insomnia are my
	curses. Let's go, Rose, you and
	Brother, let's hit the road.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you and Brother wait in the
	car. I want to speak for a moment
	Lo Mr. Hillyer.

			ROSE 
	Yes, Ma'am.

			MOTHER 
	Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy as they walk out onto the
patio of the house. Rose walks down the steps to the flower
garden and Buddy follows.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose and Buddy as Rose picks a red rose and
puts it in her hair.'

			ROSE 
	Did your Momma really give you
	castor oil?

			BUDDY 
	Yeah.

			ROSE 
		(puts an arm around his
		 shoulders)
	You're my sweetheart.

INT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy at the kitchen table.

			MOTHER 
		(earnestly)
	I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose
	and tease her like that. Of course
	her clothes are silly, but she's
	ignorant, naive, she doesn't know
	any better.

			DADDY 
	The girl worries me. If she walks
	down the street like that, an army
	will be following her.

			MOTHER 
	Well, I admit that outfit isn't
	very modest. But she doesn't mean
	any harm, she just wants to
	attract, attention.

			DADDY 
	She will succeed.

			MOTHER 
	I don't think you understand her.
	It isn't sex she wants, it's love
	she wants and this is the only way
	she knows how to get it.

			DADDY
		(musingly)
	That farmer in Gadsden was awful
	eager to get rid of her, and I'm
	beginning to see why.

			MOTHER 
	He and his wife both said she had a
	fine moral character and was
	wonderful with children.

			DADDY 
	Well, she loves children, all
	right.
		(adds dryly)
	She loves everybody.

			MOTHER 
	But that's a wonderful quality, not
	a bad quality.
		(takes his hand)
	Have a little patience with her.
	She's such a good-hearted little
	thing and tries so hard.

			DADDY 
		(stares pensively at her)
	You are the one who's good-hearted.
		(rises)
	As for Rose, let's hope for the
	best.

			MOTHER
		(rises, again takes his
		 hand)
	Be kind to her. She loves you so
	much.
		(Daddy stiffens slightly,
		 and she adds)
	In a perfectly proper way, of
	course.

			DADDY
	Yes, of course.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy waiting in a Model A. Rose is
smiling, happy to be going out. The red rose is prominent in
her hair, Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, gets into the driver's
seat of the car, He glances in a wry manner at the flower in
her hair.

			DADDY 
	What have you got in your hair,
	girl?

			ROSE
	My rose. It's kind of like a motto.
	People will say, there comes Rose
	with her rose.

Daddy gives her another wry stare and starts the Model A.

			DADDY
	You were up late last night,
	Brother.

			BUDDY
	Well, a little.

			DADDY
	Reading dirty comic bocks.
		(glances shrewdly at him)
	And you admitted it?

			BUDDY
		(a trifle uncomfortable)
	Well, yeah.

Both Rose and Buddy begin to look increasingly tense.
Hawkshaw the Detective is on the scent. Daddy stares ahead.

			DADDY 
	You were up late last night, too,
	Rose.

			ROSE 
		(meekly)
	Yes, sir. I had to go to the
	bathroom.

A long pause, as Daddy stares ahead. His expression is
inscrutable.

			DADDY 
		(finally, "casually")
	Sometimes I think I was born to be
	a detective. I get a feeling about
	things. I'm not always right, but
	often I am.

INT./EXT. MODEL A - DAY

			DADDY 
	Son, was Rose in your room last
	night?

			BUDDY 
		(scared, but a good liar)
	No. Why should Rose be in my room?

Daddy sternly scans them both. They stare back "innocently"
at him. Finally he seems to accept it.

			DADDY 
	I can't imagine why. It was just a
	thought.

Daddy shifts gears and faces front. Buddy glances upward in
relief, as if to say, "Wow, that was close."

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	Where do you want me to let you
	out, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Oh, anywhere downtown.

			MOTHER 
	That sulky boy was here again this
	afternoon. I was almost scared, he
	wouldn't go away.

			DADDY 
		(throws his napkin on
		 table)
	Rose, my patience is wearing thin.
	First a scruffy man who runs like a
	deer and now a sulky boy who wont
	go away. This is getting to be a
	regular monkey and dog show.

			ROSE 
	I swear to God I don't know who in
	the world he is. Really, I don't, I
	don't know no boy like that, I
	don't.

Slowly, his face grim, Daddy returns his napkin to his lap
and resumes eating. The children are very silent and look a
trifle scared.

			MOTHER 
		(finally, in a small
		 voice)
	Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys
	and men like her. You cant blame
	her for that, hon.

			DADDY 
	Rose, I realize you don't know this
	boy, but if you know anybody who
	does know him, if you have even a
	faint clue as to who he might be,
	then convey to him that he had
	better stay away from my house and
	stop scaring my wife... and I don't
	mean maybe.

INT. HILLYER SOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in his room at night. He is dressed
and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a
homemade crystal radio set. Enter a rather somber-faced Doll
in her nightgown.

			BUDDY 
		(listening)
	Chattanooga. I had St. Louis,
	Missouri.

			DOLL 
	Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.

			BUDDY 
	So am I.

			DOLL 
	She hasn't got any sense. In some
	ways, she's awful dumb.

			BUDDY 
		(takes off earphones,
		 gives it a moment of
		 grave consideration, then
		 his opinion)
	It isn't that she hasn't got any
	sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence
	is probably above average, maybe
	quite a bit above average.

			DOLL 
	Then why does she act so dumb?

			BUDDY 
	Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll.
	And neither does smartness. You see
	--

Buddy is interrupted by the SOUND of the distant angry shout
of a man's voice, evidently from somewhere outside in the
woods because Buddy and Doll turn at once toward the window.
In shock they listen.

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	You son of a bitch, what are you
	doing here?!

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	I'd like to ask you the same
	question, you bastard!

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	I told you to stay away from her,
	goddamn you!

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	You got no right to tell me to stay
	away from her, I knew her before
	you did!

			BUDDY 
	Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh boy. Daddy
	isn't going to like this.

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	She told you to leave her alone,
	didn't she?

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	Like hell she did! You're the one
	she wants to get shed of!

			BUDDY 
	Come on!

He and Doll hurry from the room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND STAIRS - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll running down the upstairs
hall and down the stairs. The CAM M FOLLOWS them down the
stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they slow down and creep
cautiously down the back hall to the back porch. We hear the
men yelling somewhere out in the dark bushes.

			FIRST MAN'S VOICE 
	You'll swallow teeth yourself if
	you don't leave her alone, you ugly
	bastard! Go on, throw one, throw
	one!

			SECOND MAN'S VOICE 
	I'll throw one, you son of a bitch!

We hear a great CRASHING in the bushes, a SMACK of a fist, a
GROAN of shock, an OATH, a SHOUT, more CRASHING.

EXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot from the POV of the children, on Daddy on the
back porch as the lights blaze on. He wears his bathrobe and
has a big shotgun in his hands. Now he speaks in a loud,
clear and very angry voice.

			DADDY 
	All right, I have got a Parker
	shotgun here and it is loaded and
	the trigger is cocked and wherever
	you birds are and whatever you are
	doing you had better get the hell
	out of here goddamned quick!

A sudden total silence ensues, then a sudden CRASHING in the
bushes as the "birds" take off.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	And do not come back, you sons of
	bitches! Stay away from my house
	and home and my wife and children
	or I'll blow your goddamned heads
	off!

INT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they cower in awe in the
downstairs hall. Daddy walks up to them carrying the shotgun.
He is grim and furious, but his voice is surprisingly calm.

			DADDY 
	You children go to bed. And
	Brother, stay away from Rose, I'll
	speak to her in the morning.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll in the upstairs hall. Doll
meekly goes to her room.
Buddy hesitates, looks at Rose's door, glances nervously back
at the stairs, then goes to Rose's door, knocks softly, opens
it.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose as he stands in the doorway
of her room. Rose is sitting on the edge of her bed in her
nightgown, a damp cloth held against her jaw which seems a
little swollen. A look of fear and guilt is on her face.

			ROSE 
		(rather feebly, as if it
		 explains something)
	I got an awful toothache.

			BUDDY 
		(quietly)
	Rose, if you don't keep your
	boyfriends away from the house,
	Daddy is going to fire you.

			ROSE 
		(innocently)
	But I don't know who they are.

Buddy makes an exasperated grimace and exits, shutting door.
The CAMERA REMAINS on Rose as she rolls her eyes upward in
dismay.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The
silence is deafening. Everyone looks depressed except Daddy,
who is aloofly calm. Rose's head is bowed meekly over her
plate as we hear the CLATTER of silverware. Finally, Daddy
speaks in an almost pleasant tone.

			DADDY 
	Well, Rose, my sleep was a little
	disturbed last night, and so was
	Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the
	children's. How about you? Was your
	sleep disturbed, too?

			ROSE 
		(solemnly)
	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I
	heard strange voices in the night.

			DADDY 
		(softly strumming fingers,
		 finally)
	Strange voices, Rose?

			ROSE 
		(innocent as an angel)
	Yes, sir.

			DADDY 
		(still aloofly polite)
	Now Rose, stop behaving as if
	you're Bo Peep. Those men had a
	flight last night because of some
	female in this house, and it wasn't
	Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.

			MOTHER 
		(very tense)
	I don't think we ought to discuss
	this in front of the children.

			ROSE
		(weeping, a hand over her
		 eyes)
	Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe...
	one of 'em... was Foster... but I
	don't hardly know him!

			DADDY
	Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth
	and quit crying!

			MOTHER
		(draws herself up)
	I will not sit here and listen to
	you be brutal to this poor girl.

			DADDY
	I am not being brutal to her!

			MOTHER
	You certainly are! She has an awful
	toothache, look at her jaw, it's
	all swollen.

			DADDY
		(trying to restrain
		 himself, aloofly polite
		 to the utmost)
	Darlin', it is not my fault if the
	girl has epizootics --

-- The word means "an animal epidemic," and it's a pet word
of Daddy's; he pronounces it epi-zoo-tics, not epi-zoo-ot
tics, and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady --

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	-- I am not responsible for her
	epizootics and I did not bring
	about her epizootics. Now listen to
	me. When I have to get up in the
	middle of the night and defend my
	home with a shotgun against a
	couple of damned scoundrels
	fistfighting in the bushes --

			MOTHER
	Scoundrels? They weren't
	scoundrels, they were just boys.

			DADDY 
	Boys? You say to me boys?

			MOTHER
	Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they
	were boys! Boy friends of Rose,
	chat's what they were, and why
	shouldn't she have boy friends? Do
	you want her to be unnatural? Don't
	you think she's human the same way
	you are yourself? It's the South,
	that's what it is, the South with
	its horrible traditions, of slavery
	and crime and the oppression of
	women, who are just as good as men
	and just as human!

			DADDY 
		(his eyes are a trifle
		 glazed)
	Now darlin', what has the South got
	to do with this?

			MOTHER 
		(in a real snit, afraid he
		 will fire Rose)
	And when I try to talk to you
	seriously, when I try to explain to
	you the unlimited creative power of
	life, how beautiful it would be if
	we gave up this hopeless struggle
	and simply loved each other from
	our hearts, what do you do -- you
	mock me!

			DADDY 
		(mildly, his eyes are even
		 more glazed)
	I don't intend to mock you, dear. I
	respect your philosophy. It's
	beyond my comprehension, but I
	respect it.

			ROSE
		(head bowed, weeping in a
		 little handkerchief)
	Ohhh-hh, ohhh...

			DADDY 
		(exasperated)
	Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your
	cornflakes!

			ROSE 
		(piteously)
	I'm not hungry.

The word is hongry, not hungry.

			DADDY 
	Now you listen to me, Rose --

			MOTHER 
		(with fire in her eyes)
	Just a moment! You are not going to
	fire this girl for an innocent
	thing like having boy friends, not
	while there is breath in my body!

			DADDY 
	I don't intend to fire her,
	darlin'.

			MOTHER 
	It isn't her fault if she's
	popular... what?

			DADDY 
	I said I don't intend to fire her.
	I just want to ask her to keep her
	boy friends away from my home and
	hearth, that's all.

			MOTHER 
		(simmers down at once, now
		 calmly)
	Well, that's very reasonable. Howe
	I hate to bring it up, but she's
	got an awful toothache, we've got
	to carry her to the dentist.

			ROSE 
	I don't want to go to the dentist.

			MOTHER 
	Be quiet, Rose.

			DADDY 
	Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the
	hotel. You and Brother can handle
	the girl's epizootics. I'll just
	say one more thing. 
		(turns to Rose and, in a
		 grave tone)
	Rose, I told you you had a friend
	in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she
	would fight for you like a tiger?

			ROSE 
		(meekly)
	Yes, sir.

			DADDY 
	All right, thanks to her, and
	thanks to this case of epizootics,
	you are getting another chance. 
		(points a finger at her,
		 and sternly)
	But don't try my patience again. We
	have growing children in this
	house. Do you understand me?

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Mother, Rose and Buddy in a dentist's
waiting room. Rose is holding a rubber ice bag to her jaw,
which is quite swollen. She is groaning and half weeping in
pain.

			MOTHER
	Poor thing. Does the ice help,
	Rose?

			ROSE
	Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't
	never been to no dentist before.
	He's gonna kill me, I just know it.

			MOTHER
	No, Rose, he'll help you.

ANOTHER ANGLE, Rose shrinks in fear as, enter the dentist in
a white coat, DR. WINTON, a kindly-looking, gray-haired man.
We see a nurse behind him. He smiles in a reassuring manner.

			DR. WINTON 
	Nurse says we have a nervous
	patient. Now, young lady, be calm.
	First of all, let me tell you, I am
	not going to hurt you.

			ROSE 
	Yes, you are.

			DR. WINTON 
	No, I am not.

			ROSE 
	Look, you can't kid me.

			MOTHER 
		(rises, takes her by the
		 hand)
	Now, come on, Rose. Stop being so
	childish, come on.

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Mother and Dr. Winton, as they
guide and lead Rose into the dentist's operating room.- She
plants her feet and her eyes open wide with horror as she
sees the chair and other equipment.

			ROSE 
	I'm not goin' in there, I don't
	like the looks of it!

			MOTHER 
		(annoyed)
	Rose, sit down in that chair and be
	quiet! We're trying to help you,
	you silly creature, sit in that
	chair!

			ROSE 
		(very reluctantly sits in
		 chair)
	Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna
	kill me.

			DR. WINTON 
	You and the boy wait outside.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Mother and Buddy in the waiting room. Enter
Dr. Winton with a little frown.

			DR. WINTON 
	Well, she finally let me look in
	her mouth. Is it true she's never
	been to a dentist?

			MOTHER 
	She was raised on a poor dirt farm.
	I'm sure she's never seen a dentist
	or hardly even a doctor.

			DR. WINTON 
	Well, she has one mouth in ten
	thousand, I don't see teeth like
	that once in ten years. Her trouble
	is an impacted wisdom tooth, but
	there isn't a cavity in her head,
	not a single one. She has perfect
	teeth.

			MOTHER 
	But the wisdom tooth will have to
	be pulled?

			DR. WINTON 
	Yes, and it's very bad. It probably
	should be done at the hospital
	under general anesthesia.

			MOTHER 
	That would scare her to death.
	She's terrified of hospitals. To
	her, a hospital is where you go to
	die.

			DR. WINTON 
	I think you're right, it would be
	harder on her. But you'd better
	call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to
	need help to get home.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A shot of Daddy behind the wheel of the model-A. Rose lies
pale and exhausted on Mother's shoulder on the front seat. A
trace of bloody gauze can be seen in her mouth and her eyes
are closed. Buddy is on the back seat.

			ROSE
		(a whisper, muffled by the
		 bloody gauze)
	Never again, never again...

			MOTHER
		(with pity, gently)
	I know it was bad, honey. I'm
	sorry...

			ROSE 
	No more dentists, no more
	dentists...

			MOTHER 
	It'll get better now.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model-A in the driveway of the Hillyer
home. Mother helps Rose out of the car, but Rose can't stand
on her feet. Daddy has to catch her from falling. Daddy picks
her up in his arms and carries her up the steps as Buddy runs
ahead to open the front door.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HILLYER PATIO - DAY

A shot of Mother and Daddy and Buddy on the patio. It is a
beautiful sunny morning. Mother and Daddy are seated at an
outdoor table about to have coffee. Daddy is opening mail and
Buddy, in the b.g., is gluing up a kite. Enter a smiling and
healthy Rose with orange juice, toast, cups and coffee on a
tray.

			DADDY 
	Good morning, Rose. And how do you
	feel today?

			ROSE 
	Wonderful. Except I can touch the
	place back there with my tongue, I
	wouldn't even know I had that tooth
	pulled.

			DADDY 
		(dryly, as he looks at
		 mail)
	Well, I know it, I just got the
	bill for it.

			ROSE 
	Boy, for four or five days there I
	didn't think I'd live. But I'm my
	old self again!

			DADDY 
	Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange
	voices in the night, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Oh, no, sir.

			MOTHER 
	Rose has learned her lesson,
	haven't you, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Yes, ma'am.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL - MEZZANINE - DAY

A shot of Daddy peering down at an old pool table in the
mezzanine of the family hotel. Buddy stands by with a pool
stick in hand. In the b.g., we see a black bellboy, SHADRACH,
approaching.

			DADDY 
	I see my mother-in-law's face, son.
	Read 'em and weep, boy, I am
	playing a spectacular combination,
	a triple. The nine ball in the
	corner! 
		(takes his stance with cue
		 as Shadrach walks up)
	Read 'em and weep, boy, that's all
	she wrote.

			SHADRACH 
	Mistah Hillyer, the Chief of Police
	wants you on the telephone.

			DADDY 
		(about to make his shot,
		 looks around)
	The Chief of Police?

			SHADRACH 
	Yassuh.

Daddy straightens up, sets his jaw, leans the cue against the
table and marches toward the elevator as Buddy stares after
him. The CAMERA STAYS on Buddy.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy going down the hotel stairs. He holds
onto the banister, sliding with his hands far ahead in order
to take four and even five steps at a time -- it is a
childish trick, the point of the game is to touch as few
stairs as possible.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy as he jumps down the last remaining
five steps and walks into the lobby. Daddy comes from behind
the desk, grim.

			DADDY 
	Rose is in jail. She bit a
	policeman's thumb. Come on, son,
	Shadrach can run the hotel.

EXT. MODEL-A - STREET - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the Model-A. Daddy stares
grimly ahead. Buddy steals a worried glance at him.

INT. LOCAL JAIL - DAY

CUT TO a shot in the local jail. The shot is on Daddy as he
stands before jail bars staring sternly into a cell. His
hands are on his hips, his straw hat is on the back of his
head and a bit to one side. Buddy stands beside him, a little
bit behind, a worried look on his face. The CHIEF OF POLICE,
a fat man, is on the other side of Daddy.

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose in the cell. Her hair is mussed,
her dress is torn. A little innocent, frightened smile is on
her face. The CAMERA PANS to include Daddy and the Chief of
Police.

			CHIEF OF POLICE 
	That was a awful brawl down at the
	Busy Beaver, Mr. Hillyer. You know
	that fat Horton, the bootlegger?

			DADDY 
	Yes, I know the son of a bitch.

			CHIEF OF POLICE 
	Son of a bitch is right, he dern
	near killed a man. And this girl
	was the cause of it all. What's
	more, she bit a police officer's
	thumb right to the bone.

			DADDY 
	Well, Rose, what have you got to
	say for yourself?

			ROSE 
		(coughs, then feebly)
	I got an awful bad cold.

			DADDY 
		(nods slowly, then with
		 aloof politeness)
	That's all you've got to say,
	you've got a bad cold?

			ROSE 
		(coughs again)
	Well, I don't know what happened.
	They were arguin' about baseball,
	then all of 'em started fightin'.
	As for that policeman, I didn't
	bite him, I don't think I bit him.

In dour silence, Daddy and the Chief of Police stare at Rose.
She gives them a little smile, as if to say, "See how
innocent I am?" The Chief turns to Daddy and asks with dry
irony:

			CHIEF OF POLICE 
	Well, she's your girl, Mr. Hillyer.
	You want me to release her in your
	custody?

			DADDY 
	No, not really. But I guess we'll
	have to do that, John. Let her out.
	Let the crazy creature out and I'll
	take her home.

INT./EXT. MODEL-A - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the Model A. Daddy
stares grimly ahead, silent. Buddy looks solemn. Rose is
badly frightened and still coughing. Finally she ventures a
little smile and speaks to Daddy.

			ROSE 
	I got an awful cold, I think I'm
	sick.

Daddy is silent, his eyes fixed ahead.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it turns onto the Hillyer
driveway.

INT./EXT. MODEL A

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. She tries
again.

			ROSE 
	I didn't mean to bite him. He was
	hitting Horton with a blackjack in
	the meanest way and... and I bit
	him accidental.

			DADDY 
		(stops the car, turns to
		 Rose)
	I have to go back to the hotel. I'm
	on duty at the desk and who knows a
	quest might arrive. I will see you
	at suppertime, Rose.

			ROSE 
		(a feeble smile)
	I didn't mean to bite him, I really
	didn't.

			DADDY 
	I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

			ROSE 
		(feebly)
	Yes, air.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a shaky, slumped Rose going up the steps
with Buddy as the Model A drives away. Rose is coughing,
looks miserable.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of Buddy and Doll in the living room of the Hillyer
home at night. Doll is half-heartedly practicing scales on
the piano and Buddy is pacing the floor, hands clasped behind
him in something like the style of his father. As the CAMERA
FOLLOWS Buddy in his pacing we see Waski playing with marbles
on the floor.

			DOLL 
		(turns around on piano
		 stool, to Buddy)
	What is Rose going to do? Where can
	she go?

			BUDDY 
	They've been in there the longest
	kind of time. I can't stand it, I
	gotta find out what's going on.

			DOLL 
	You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill
	you!

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy coming with great furtiveness from the
living room out into the front hall. Very cautiously, he
tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door
of his mother's bedroom-study. He crouches down, peeps
through the keyhole.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY - NIGHT

CUT TO a "keyhole shot" of Daddy and Mother in the bedroom.
Mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes.
Daddy sits in a chair nearby. He looks depressed.

			DADDY 
	I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as
	much as you do.

			MOTHER
		(wanly)
	Well, she does seem to cause a lot
	of trouble, I admit. But she
	doesn't mean any harm and it'll
	break the children's hearts, they
	all love her.

			DADDY 
	It's because of the children she's
	got to go. I don't want to be
	holier-than-thou, but the girl
	doesn't have the same outlook we
	do. Morals don't mean a thing to
	her, not a thing, and we can't have
	a girl like that in this house.

			MOTHER 
	Who is to say our morals are better
	than hers?
		(frowns, sighs)
	But maybe you're right. She
	could... influence Dolly...

			DADDY 
	That is exactly what I'm afraid of. 
		(pauses, and firmly)
	The girl has got to go, darlin'.

			MOTHER 
	But morals come from the heart, not
	from rigid rules and empty laws.
	And in her heart Rose has never
	hurt anyone and she never would.
	Therefore, she's not immoral. Not
	really.

			DADDY 
	Now look, darlin', this is no time
	to go off into the fourth
	dimension.

			MOTHER 
	But what I said is the simple
	truth. And now I see something
	else, I see more deeply into it...

Mother has a slightly "other-worldly" look on her face. Daddy
glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something.

			DADDY 
	Just a moment, darlin'.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy crouched at the keyhole. With great
alacrity, he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts
the living room door just as Daddy whisks open the bedroom
door. Daddy grimaces.

			DADDY 
	Could of sworn that boy was out
	here.

Daddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of
a ballet Buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to
the keyhole.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a Shot of Daddy and Mother. It is another "keyhole
shot."

			MOTHER 
	How could Rose really be a bad
	influence on Dolly? She has a
	loving nature, you ought to want
	someone like that around your
	children. Why do you think those
	boys and men like her?

			DADDY
	Well, I have a pretty good idea.

			MOTHER 
	If you mean sex, you couldn't be
	more wrong. Rose likes those boys
	and men, she has love in her heart,
	and that is what they want. It's
	the most rare and beautiful thing
	in life and that is why they follow
	her.

			DADDY 
	They follow her because she's a -- 
		(he is about to say "piece
		 of tail," but interrupts
		 himself)
	-- no, I won't say that.

			MOTHER 
	What she doesn't understand is that
	her behavior is disturbing to other
	people. She's young, she's got to
	learn to restrain the life force
	that's in her. Its creative, but in
	her case it's too creative.

			DADDY 
	Darlin', Rose has got to go!

			MOTHER 
		(rises)
	I'll talk to her, I'll reason with
	her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the hall. He jumps up and hurries
across the hall into the living room. Again, as the living
room door shuts the bedroom door opens. Mother starts up the
stairs, her mouth determined.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the living room.

			DOLL
	What's happening?

			BUDDY 
	Mother is struggling desperately.
	In fact she's fighting like a
	tiger. But I don't know, it's
	close, it's mighty close.

			DOLL 
		(pauses, then in a low
		 tone, slightly wide-eyed)
	Buddy... does Rose really... "do
	it" with all those boys and men?

			BUDDY 
		(aloofly, like Daddy)
	Doll, don't ask childish questions.

			WASKI 
		(indignantly, to Doll)
	Of course not!

			BUDDY 
	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what
	we're talking about.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother going down the upstairs hall. She
knocks on Roses door and enters.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother as she walks over and stares down in
shock at Rose on the bad. Rose is lying back on a pillow and
staring groggily at her, obviously not quite all there.
Frowning with worry, Mother sits beside her and puts a hand
on her forehead.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you're very sick. You're
	burning up. Rose, can you hear me?
	Rose?

			ROSE 
		(semi-delirious)
	What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?

EXT. HILLYER SOME - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of an ambulance pulling up outside the Hillyer
house. Attendants get out of it carrying a stretcher.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front hall.
They are badly frightened, even terrified.
The CAMERA PANS to show the ambulance attendants carrying
Rose strapped in a stretcher down the stairs, as Mother helps
and Daddy follows, both of them very worried. Rose is
conscious now and her eyes roll with terror toward the
children.

			ROSE 
	Buddy! Dolly! They're takin' me to
	the hospital! Don't let 'em, don't
	let 'em!

The CAMERA STAYS on the frightened silent children as they
stare after Rose on the stretcher.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the
corridor of a hospital. All look very solemn. A nurse leads
them to a door and opens it.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of a hospital room. A very pale, sick-looking
Rose lies in a hospital bed. The nurse, mother, Daddy, Buddy,
Doll and Waski enter, all of them looking very grave.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE ON Rose as she weakly turns her head on
the pillow. Her eyes well with tears as she recognizes the
children.

			ROSE
		(a feeble whisper)
	Pray for me...

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the nurse as she speaks in a whisper we
don't hear to Mother and Daddy, obviously telling them they'd
better go. Daddy beckons to the children and they start to
leave, all looking depressed.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of DR. F. ROBERT MARTINSON, a rather unpleasant
man with a spade beard. He has a superior, patronizing way of
talking and very little Southern accent if any. The scene is
his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.

As he speaks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Daddy, Mother and
the Hillyer children.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is
	strong as an ox and that is what is
	keeping her alive. But not many
	people walk away from double
	pneumonia, Madam, not many.

			MOTHER 
	She looks terrible, just awful.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Of course she does and I must say
	I'm puzzled by your delay in
	getting her to the hospital. I
	should think ordinary powers of
	observation would have suggested to
	you that she was seriously ill.

			MOTHER 
	She hid it from us, Doctor. She's
	afraid of the hospital.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(a thin superior smile)
	Afraid of the hospital?

			MOTHER 
	Deathly afraid of it. Her people
	were poor tenant farmers and she
	doesn't know anything about doctors
	or medicine or hospitals.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(frowns in open disbelief)
	A tenant farm? Are you trying to
	tell me that girl is a product of
	the hookworm and pellagra belt?

			MOTHER 
	Well, her people were very poor.
	She says she was often hungry as a
	child, and I'm sure the food she
	ate was pretty awful, not a
	balanced diet at all.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Exactly, and that's why she
	couldn't possibly have come from
	such a farm.

			DADDY 
		(icily polite)
	Excuse me, sir, are you calling my
	wife a liar?

			MOTHER 
		(embarrassed)
	Honey, please...

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(a thin unpleasant smile)
	It's simply that I find it
	incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from
	the girl's illness at the moment,
	she is very strong, a very healthy
	specimen of a young human female --
	and a comely one, too. She must
	have gotten protein somewhere as a
	young child, if only sporadically.

			MOTHER 
	It is kind of amazing. The dentist
	says she has perfect teeth, there
	isn't a cavity in her mouth.

			MR. MARTINSON 
		(tries to make a
		 supercilious joke)
	Her entire mouth is a cavity,
	Madam, ha ha ha.

			DADDY 
		(dryly, doesn't like the
		 man a bit)
	Ha ha ha ha.

Mother frowns at Daddy and Dr. Martinson gives him an aloof
glance.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(with spurious dignity)
	The point is you don't grow up like
	that on a diet of sorghum and
	hominy grits. She got protein
	somewhere, she's a very strong girl
	and I think she'll live... despite
	the delay in medical treatment.

			DADDY 
	That's all I want to know. 
		(rises)
	Lets get out of here before I get
	the epizootics myself. Thank you,
	Doctor, for your discourse, it was
	fascinating, no doubt.

			MOTHER 
	Yes, thank you, Doctor.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(as they leave)
	I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do
	you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an
	animal epidemic?

			DADDY 
		(icily polite, from the
		 door)
	No, I mean epizootics.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski as
Daddy comes out of the Doctor's office and shuts the door.

			DADDY 
	I can't stand that polecat. They
	ought to hang him.

			MOTHER 
	You don't like him because he's a
	Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.

			DADDY 
	He's a polecat, dear.

INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Mother and the Hillyer children in a
hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them
down. Daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring
pensively ahead.

			DADDY
	Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in
	that bed. 
		(sighs, shakes his head)
	I hope she'll be all right, but I
	still think we ought to fire her.

			MOTHER 
	I don't see how you can even think
	of it now.

Daddy purses his lips but says nothing. It is obvious the
"epizootics" have saved Rose, at least for the time being.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of Rose in bed in her own bedroom. She is propped up
on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk
housecoat of Mother's.
A tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as Buddy
sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather
listening to her. It is obvious she is well on the road back
to health.

			ROSE 
	Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside,
	and so unhappy with that rich wife
	who doesn't understand him, her
	being a Southerner and everything,
	and what a bedside manner he has
	got -- so gentle and kind beneath
	the professor way he acts!

			BUDDY 
	Rose, you are too uncritical of
	people.

			ROSE 
	You don't know the bedside manner
	that man has got. Why, it does me
	good just to see him sit there all
	solemn and go pokin' in his bag
	like he's gonna cure me, which he
	did of course. And even more
	important he loves me, like a
	patient I mean, the other day he
	got tears in his eyes just
	listenin' to my heart beat.

			BUDDY 
	He did?

			ROSE 
	Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw
	'em, and a little bit he says to
	me, "You know, you are beautiful."
	Now wasn't that a nice thing for a
	doctor to say to a patient, wasn't
	it? What could cheer a girl up
	more?

			BUDDY 
	Rose, I have got doubts about that
	doctor and so does Daddy.

			ROSE 
	He's got doubts about hisself and
	that's the saddest thing of all.
	Would you believe that poor man
	thinks nobody likes him?

			BUDDY 
	Yeah, I'd believe it.

			ROSE 
	Well, I like him. I used to be
	afraid of doctors but not any more.
	Why, he could operate on me any old
	time and I wouldn't even be scared.

			BUDDY 
	Rose, you are just entirely too
	uncritical of people.

			ROSE 
	I ain't neither. Listen here,
	Buddy, besides all his vast medical
	knowledge, he has the most kindest
	heart beneath the professor way he
	acts -- he wants justice in the
	world and he's got some real
	interestin' ideas.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother opening the front door. Dr. Martinson
is there-with his black bag, an icy polite look on his face.;

			MOTHER 
	Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a
	lot better, I just gave her her
	supper. She's almost all well now.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Let me be the judge of that, Madam.

			MOTHER 
	Yes. Well. She's upstairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in Rose's bedroom.

			ROSE 
	Justice, that's what he wants,
	justice for everybody and
	especially for niggers. And I think
	that's real nice of him because
	black people don't have a very good
	life, you got to admit that, to be
	a nigger is sometimes practic'ly
	fatal, but the wife don't
	understand all of that, she thinks
	niggers are just so much dirt,
	which anybody ought to know better
	if they been on their ass their
	ownselves -- and that is the cause
	of his profound unhappiness, Buddy,
	that no-good-mean wife with all her
	Southern prejudice against niggers
	and everything!

It is a very long speech and delivered with a non-stop
vitality that leaves Buddy a trifle groggy. Slowly, he shakes
his head, as enter Mother.

			MOTHER 
	The Doctor is here. And Brother,
	supper is ready.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A SHOT of the Hillyer family minus Rose eating dinner in the
dining room. The meal is almost finished, Daddy cutting apple
pie.

			DADDY 
	Is that Doctor still up there,
	Brother.

			BUDDY 
	Yeah, he's still up there.

			DADDY 
	What's taking the rascal so long?

			MOTHER 
	Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a
	rascal, he's one of the finest
	physicians in Glenville. He studied
	at Johns Hopkins University.

			DADDY 
	I don't care where the polecat
	studied.

			MOTHER 
	Sometimes the negativism and
	cynicism in you makes me want to
	vomit. 
		(shakes her head sadly as
		 Buddy surreptitiously
		 puts his napkin on table)
	Your real trouble is that you're
	anti-intellectual. The irony is
	women are supposed to be emotional,
	but I never saw anybody who
	depended more on emotion and
	prejudice than you do.

			BUDDY 
		(a half audible murmur)
	Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.

			MOTHER 
	Now I have a plan about Rose, an
	educational plan. She's getting
	better and we don't want any more
	trouble --
		(notices Buddy slipping
		 out)
	Brother, you ought to hear this.

			BUDDY 
	I'll be right back.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he slips out during following
speech.

			MOTHER 
	First, those clothes she wears.
	They're too provocative. I've
	talked to her a lot about it and I
	think she understands...

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy as he goes down the hall, eyes
narrowed.

ON Buddy posted in the doorway of the living room. He has his
hands on his hips Daddy-style and is staring sternly up the
stairs.

CUT TO A POV SHOT of Dr. Martinson with his black bag in hand
and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs. The man is
slinking, has quilt written all over him. As he goes down the
stairs he glances to one side, sees Buddy and frowns. The man
gives a sudden nervous start of fright as we hear Daddy's
voice loud on the TRACK.

			DADDY (O.S.)
	Everything all right, Doctor?

CUT TO A POV shot of Daddy at the rear of the downstairs
hall, napkin in hand and hands on hips. He is staring sternly
at the doctor.

CUT BACK TO the Doctor. He glances nervously again toward
Buddy.

ANOTHER POV SHOT of Buddy. Looks just like Daddy, hands on
hips.

ON Dr. Martinson, as he looks back at Daddy.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Oh, yes. Yes. Just fine. A few more
	days... a little more rest...
	she'll be perfectly healthy.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy as he walks forward down the hall
toward Buddy. The CAMERA PICKS UP Buddy and both of them
grimly stare after the fleeing doctor.

			DADDY 
		(in a low, conspiratorial
		 tone)
	What do you think, Brother?

			BUDDY 
	I don't know. But you better watch
	him like a hawk, if he comes back
	again.

			DADDY 
	He's not coming back again. We
	scared the rascal off, son.

	Come on back to supper. Your mother
	has a theory about how to educate
	Rose.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A SHOT of Mother and Rose and the children in the kitchen. We
see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. Rose has
on a new and modest little dress that Mother evidently has
made for her.

			MOTHER 
	You see, Rose? Now that's the kind
	of dress you ought to wear.

			ROSE
		(less than enthusiastic)
	Yeah, it's kinda nice.

			MOTHER 
	You look very pretty in it, Rose.
	Really, you do.

			ROSE 
		(smiles at Mother)
	Well, you're real sweet to make it
	for me.
		(puts an arm around
		 Mother's shoulder)
	There never was nobody like you.
	And you don't need to worry, I
	ain't goin' out no more.

			MOTHER 
	Well, there's no reason you
	shouldn't go out, Rose... in
	moderation.

			ROSE 
		(a little shrug)
	I don't want to. When I was lyin'
	there in that hospital bed at
	death's door I says to myself, I
	ain't goin' out no more. If I ever
	get outta this, I'll just stay
	home.

Rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there
in panties and bra, oblivious of Buddy and the children. She
has about as much modesty as a small child herself.

			ROSE (CONT'D)
		(rather sadly)
	Besides, there ain't no Mr. Right
	out there. Or if there is I can't
	find him, all I find is a pile of
	Mr. Wrongs. I ain't goin' out no
	more.

see them shaking hands with the Minister. Rose smiles
sweetly, modestly.

EXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the Model A driving up in the driveway of
the Hillyer house.

ANOTHER ANGLE on them all as they get out of the car. Rose
takes Doll's hand with one hand and Waski's hand with the
other.

			ROSE 
	All right, we'll play monopoly
	then.

Mother, Daddy and Buddy watch Rose go up the steps with Doll
and Waski.

			MOTHER 
	She's like a different person.
	Being so sick made a big impression
	on her. I really think she's
	learned a lesson.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm. 
		(waits as Mother goes on
		 up steps, then turns to
		 Buddy and in a low tone)
	Come with me, Brother. I want to
	show you something.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE GARDEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in a rose garden below the
windows of the house.

It is Hawkshaw the Detective and his Unwilling Assistant.
Daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.

			DADDY 
	See that, son? Now this is a heel,
	see, and there, that's the ball of
	a foot. Someone has been walking
	here.

			BUDDY 
		(reluctantly)
	Well, it's not very plain.

			DADDY 
	That is because it rained recently,
	the rain has obscured the evidence.
	But you could still take plaster
	casts of these footprints, then
	match up the plaster casts with
	whosever shoes they are, and that
	way you could catch him --
	understand?

			BUDDY 
	But how would you find him?

			DADDY 
	Well. Well, what I mean is, you
	could prove it was his shoes if you
	did catch him. But look this,
	Brother, it is even more
	interesting. Look at this mark
	here, and that mark over there. Now
	wouldn't you say those marks are
	the marks of a ladder?

			BUDDY 
	Well, I don't know. 
		(trying to sound like a
		 fellow detective, but
		 doesn't want Rose to get
		 caught)
	No, I don't know, Daddy, I think
	the rain has obscured it.

			DADDY 
	True, but if you look sharply you
	can see that those marks are the
	marks of a ladder. Now let's go
	back to the garage and see if the
	ladder has been tampered with.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are
scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the
garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead
ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this,
it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny.

			DADDY 
		(points to ladder, eyes
		 narrowed)
	See, son? The paint is flaked off
	here, freshly. Look at it, Brother,
	there is no question about it. Some
	person or persons unknown have very
	recently tampered with this ladder.

			BUDDY 
	Well... maybe...

			DADDY 
	And there's only one reason anybody
	would want this ladder -- to get up
	into Rose's bedroom in the dark of
	night! I am going to chain up this
	ladder and padlock it! -- and that
	is not all I am going to do!

Buddy stares at him in apprehension.

			DADDY 
	I mean a human investment, Rose, we

	She hasn't actually done
	anything...

			DADDY 
		(very firmly)
	Just a moment, dear. 
		(turns to Rose and almost
		 sadly)
	We can't have it, Rose. Can you
	behave yourself -- or not? That is
	the question, to behave or not to
	behave, to suffer the slings and
	arrows of outrageous chastity and
	keep your skirt down or to hoist it
	in the light of the moon and make
	whoopee -- that is the coil
	shuffling question. 
		(a dramatic pause, then
		 points at her)
	If you can't behave I am going to
	fire you and I say it in front of
	you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it.
	I point my rigid finger right at
	your nose, Rose, and I stare

	Yes, sir.

INT. HILLYER HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy, Doll and Waski as they climb from the
crawl space down into the cellar by the furnace.

			DOLL 
	Well, if she's got any sense at

			BUDDY 
	Sense doesn't mean anything to

	Open up, Rose! Procrastination
	won't help you!

Finally, the CLICK of a bolt and slowly the door opens. We

	Where are you, you son of a bitch?

In her distress and dismay, the sheet has come down over
Rose's shoulder and one of her breasts is exposed.

			DADDY 
	And what, may I ask, was Billy
	doing here?

			ROSE 
		(a straight answer)
	Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very
	poor, he don't have no money and
	there wasn't no place else to go.

			DADDY 
	Well, it was a silly question.

			ROSE 
	He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He
	wants to be a fireman.

			DADDY 
	Ye gods and little fishes, a
	fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose,
	you're naked as a jay bird. When
	you're dressed, come on downstairs.
	I'm afraid your friend Billy is
	injured, where are his clothes?

			ROSE 
		(begins weeping, both
		 breasts now are exposed)
	Under the mattress. I hid 'em so
	you wouldn't be mad. He wants to
	marry me, he loves me. I can't
	marry him, he's too young and
	hasn't got no job, but he loves
	me... now you wouldn't hurt him,
	would you?

Daddy gently pulls the sheet around her to cover her breasts.

			DADDY 
	I won't hurt him, honey.

drinking coffee in the early morning. Daddy looks grave,
Mother looks sad, and Rose is crying into a handkerchief.

			ROSE 
	Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and
	I hadn't ought to of done it. But
	I'm only a human girl and I... I
	ain't always perfect. I promise I
	won't let him in the house no more,
	I promise. Won't you and Mrs.
	Hillyer forgive me?

			DADDY 
	Rose, darlin', you break my heart.
	But I am only a human man myself of
	the father variety. Rose, pack your
	bag, baby, as of this moment you
	are hired, mired and fired.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The
dissolve suggests that some time has gone by. Daddy looks a
bit grim, Rose has a wan and depressed expression. Mother
looks worried.

			DADDY 
		(politely)
	Well, Rose, going out to look for a
	job today?

			ROSE 
		(eyes down)
	What's the use, there ain't none.

			DADDY 
	Mmm. Would you get me another half
	a-cup of coffee, dear?

Rose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to Mother.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	It has been three weeks since I
	"fired" her. Is there no way to get
	rid of this girl? Are we stuck with
	her for life?

			MOTHER 
	She can't get a job, it's a
	depression. And we can't just throw
	her out on the street.

			DADDY 
	The hell we can't.

Rose returns with coffee and pours it out for Daddy.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you don't look well and you
	haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.

			ROSE 
	I'm not hungry. I can't eat
	nothin', I haven't been able to eat
	since I got fired. I think maybe
	I'm sick.

			DADDY 
	God forbid. You're not sick, Rose,
	forget it. Don't get any notions in
	your head, you're not sick.

			ROSE 
	Yes, sir.

			MOTHER 
	She does look a little peaky.

			DADDY
	No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine.
	She's perfectly healthy, don't give
	her ideas.

			ROSE 
	Well, I'll do the dishes, then I'm
	goin' to lie down a minute and
	rest. My stomach hurts.

Daddy watches Rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward
and speaks to Mother, his expression a bit sly.

			DADDY 
	Her plan is obvious, plain as day.
	She's going on a hunger strike. The
	question is, how do we foil her?

			MOTHER 
	She's just nervous and worried. And
	you would be, too, if you had no
	job and no place to go.

Buddy on the patio notices it.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the kitchen on Mother and Rose. Mother is
helping a rather wan Rose prepare dinner. Enter Daddy.

			DADDY 
		(as if everyone will be

	Well, I have got news! I called
	long distance and spoke to Cousin
	Hop and you'll be glad to know,
	Rose, I have found you a job!

			ROSE 
	Tennessee?

			DADDY 
	Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!

			ROSE 
	Well. What kinda job is it?

			DADDY 
	Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a
	fine, outdoor-type job.

			ROSE 
	You mean a farm?

			DADDY 
	No, no, not exactly. It isn't a
	farm in the sense that it's a farm.
	Not at all. It's a... dairy
	establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm
	sure you'll like it because it's
	so... peaceful!

Rose bows her head and begins crying.

			MOTHER 
	Honey, Rose was born on a farm and
	has terrible memories of farm life.
	Now I don't think --

			DADDY 
	Just a minute, Rose, you don't
	understand. This isn't a dirt farm
	like the one you were born on, it's
	nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I
	talked to him on the phone, a fine
	man... it's not a farm, damn it,
	it's a beautiful dairy
	establishment! Stop crying, Rose!
	Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's
	ideal!

			MOTHER 
	I don't know how you can call it
	ideal -- don't you know what the
	word "farm" means to her?

			DADDY 
	I don't give a hoot in hell's
	hollow what it means to her! She
	can't stay in this house forever! I
	fired her, damn it!

			MOTHER 
	It sounds like a farm to me.
	Calling it a dairy establishment,
	that's just trickery and flummery.

			DADDY 
	Trickery and flummery or not, she's
	going there tomorrow on the bus!
	It's settled! And I must say we've
	been more than fair to you, Rose,
	it's pretty selfish and mean
	hearted of you to sit there and cry
	like that!

Rose sits head bowed at the kitchen table.

			ROSE 
	I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm
	cryin' because of somebody else.

interest, eyes wide.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Daddy. He is peering intently at Rose.

			DADDY 
	What did you say, Rose?

CLOSE ON Rose, as she turns, weeping.

			ROSE 
	Well, I was born on a farm
	myself... and I hate to think of
	the baby being born on one.

On them all. Daddy and Mother stare in shock at Rose.

			DADDY 
	What baby? What baby? What baby are
	you speaking about?

			ROSE 
	Mine.

			DADDY 
	Your baby?

			ROSE 
	Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.

			DADDY 
		(he is "poleaxed,"
		 staggered)
	Good God almighty. This is a
	catastrophe, they won't hire her.

			MOTHER 
		(looks up, sees Buddy in
		 patio window)
	Brother, get out of that window!

Buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. Both Mother and
Daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned
with him.

			DADDY
		(stares off groggily into
		 space)
	This is a total catastrastroke. As
	of this moment I am stumped, I
	admit, I am stumped and treed both,
	the hound dogs have me surrounded.

			MOTHER 
		(as Rose begins crying)
	Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know
	you feel awful, but don't cry,
	honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the
	father, dear?

			ROSE 
	Well, I... I... I don't know...
	maybe it was... but no, you can't
	be sure about a thing like that. It
	wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.

			MOTHER 
		(gently)
	I know it's embarrassing... but who
	were you exposed to, dear?
	ROSE 
	Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h,
	that's kinda hard to say.

			DADDY 
	You're not going to get anywhere
	with that line of questioning. The
	problem is, what are we going to
	do?

			MOTHER 
	That's why I'm asking her who the
	father is. It's the most vital
	question of all. Who's the father,
	dear?

			DADDY 
		(offhand; he is thinking
		 hard about what to do)
	She already told you, she doesn't
	know.

			MOTHER
		(naively)
	But she must know... unless...
	unless... Rose, was there more than
	one person?

			ROSE 
		(weeping in handkerchief)
	Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't
	think. I... I'm not really sure.

			MOTHER 
		(gently, a tiny frown, a
		 bit shocked)
	Rose, really, you shouldn't act
	like that.

			ROSE 
		(weeping)
	Oh, I know. But I didn't, really.
	Honestly, I didn't. There was only
	one, but he's out of town and leave
	no forwardin' address.

			DADDY
		(a brilliant idea)
	Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No
	forwarding address, huh? 
		(turns to Mother)
	In the shock of this brilliant
	move, I forgot something.

			MOTHER 
	What did you forget?

			DADDY 
	I forgot that Rose will lie like a
	child. She's no more pregnant than
	I am, she just doesn't want to go
	to that farm!

			ROSE 
	Yes, I am.

			DADDY 
	No, you're not.

			ROSE 
	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.

			DADDY 
		(triumphant, sure he's
		 right)
	All right, tell us, Rose, what
	makes you think you're pregnant?

			ROSE
		(simply)
	I haven't had my period for three
	months and my stomach is getting
	big.

			DADDY
		(again "poleaxed" for a
		 moment, but pulls himself
		 together)
	I don't believe it.

			ROSE
	It's so, Mr. Hillyer.

			DADDY
	All right, damn it. We've seen you
	with your clothes off around here,
	stand up and pull up your dress and
	let's take a look!

			MOTHER
	Honey!

			DADDY
	She doesn't have to take her
	panties off, we can see her stomach
	with 'em on. All she has to do is
	pull up her dress and let us see
	her belly.

			ROSE 
	Well, all right, if you just won't
	believe me.

Rose stands up.

			MOTHER 
	Rose, you don't have to.

			ROSE 
	I don't mind.

			DADDY 
	Now, you will see, she's lying like
	she always does -- that belly will
	be flat as a pancake!

Rose lifts her dress and Daddy leans forward eagerly to
confirm his belief. Rose stands there with her skirt lifted.
She has on a pair of skimpy white panties. An unmistakable,
definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel
just above the line of her panties. A stupefied look is on
Daddy's face.

			MOTHER 
	I'd say about three months. Are you
	satisfied?

			DADDY 
	I am poleaxed and in a non compos
	mentis condition. I wash my hands
	or the whole thing.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S SOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Dr. Martinson's private office in his home,
quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. A
sober-looking Mother and Daddy sit talking to him. He almost
seems to relish the situation.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I'm not surprised you thought she
	was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can
	look very much like pregnancy. But
	it was pure wishful thinking on her
	part. The girl can never have
	children, she had gonorrhea at
	fifteen and it was untreated.

			MOTHER 
		(shocked, rather feebly)
	Gonorrhea?

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Don't worry, Madam, she can't
	infect your dear little kiddies.
	She long ago fully recovered, but
	the disease did irreparable damage.
	The girl is permanently barren.

			MOTHER 
	Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose,
	what a life she has had.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	We make our own lives, Madam. As
	for malignancy, I don't think so,
	it's very unlikely. I probably
	shouldn't have even mentioned that
	possibility to her.

			MOTHER 
		(rather coldly, seems
		 disenchanted with him)
	No, you shouldn't have, it was
	needlessly cruel. She thinks she
	has cancer and is going to die.

			DR. MARTINSON
	She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was
	merely giving her the facts.

			DADDY 
	Well, it's a disaster. I don't know
	what to say, Doctor, I am floored.
	How dangerous is the operation?

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Any major operation is dangerous.
	However, as we know from her
	previous illness, she's a very
	strong girl.

			DADDY 
	Well, if it isn't malignant and she
	can get through the operation all
	right, it might be better than her
	really being pregnant. She doesn't
	even know who the father might have
	been.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Oh, it's definitely better, beyond
	question. A fatherless child, an
	ignorant girl with no job, no
	money, no home. It's fortunate, a
	blessing really, and a stroke of
	good luck for another reason I want
	to mention to you.

			MOTHER 
		(totally disenchanted with
		 the Doctor)
	This conversation is making me a
	little sick.

			DADDY 
	Honey, that's no way to talk to the
	Doctor, he's merely doing his job,
	dear.

Oddly enough, in the stress of the situation, Daddy now seems
almost friendly to Dr. Martinson, whom previously he
considered a polecat.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

helping her lie on the couch on pillows as she weeps, a hand
over her face.

			BUDDY
	I gotta find out what they're

	Rose, and I'll give you a report on
	it.

			ROSE 
	I don't want to know...

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE shot of Dr. Martinson. An expression of
distaste is on his face. The CAMERA pulls back as he talks to
Mother and Daddy.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I'm sorry the truth nauseates you,
	Mrs. Hillyer, because before you
	leave there's a bit more of it I'd
	like to put to you. This operation
	provides a therapeutic opportunity
	that I feel is quite important in
	regard to this particular girl, who
	suffers not only from an ovarian
	cyst but from a certain
	psychoneurotic condition as well.

			MOTHER 
	What do you mean, what kind of
	gobbledygook talk is that?

			DADDY 
	Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am
	following you.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(gives Mother an aloof
		 glance, then to Daddy)
	First, about the girl's history.
	Evidently she's been very
	promiscuous since early childhood,
	she has no control over her sexual
	impulses. Furthermore, she is
	permanently barren, she can't have
	children.

			DADDY 
	Go on, Doctor.

			MOTHER
		(quietly)
	Yes, go on.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I am thinking particularly of the
	other ovary. As a rule I don't
	believe in removing it. The woman's
	hormonal system is profoundly
	disturbed, she is subject to
	possibly serious depression, she
	loses many of her secondary sexual
	characteristics for example, her
	breasts might shrink and become
	flabby, facial hair might appear
	along with a coarsening of the
	features, and of course her sexual
	drive is greatly diminished,
	especially in a girl or young
	woman. For these reasons I am
	opposed to removing the other
	ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

			DADDY 
	I am ahead of you.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Then... may I speak quite frankly
	with you, Mr. Hillyer?

			DADDY 
	Please do.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I have of course observed the girl
	in treating her.

			DADDY 
	Of course.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	I think we both know her.

			DADDY 
	Yes, we know her.

			MOTHER 
	What are you talking about? I don't
	understand all this mumbo jumbo and
	the funny looks on your faces.

			DR. MARTINSON 
	Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in
	more ways than one. She is an
	extreme psychoneurotic with
	uncontrollable sexual impulses. It
	would be a mercy to spare her the
	suffering she causes herself and
	others. Therefore I recommend as a
	therapeutic measure the removal of
	her second ovary. It is ethically
	and medically the only proper
	decision in this case and I suspect
	your husband agrees with me.

			DADDY 
	Reluctantly, I do. It would be a
	blessing to her and everyone else.
	The girl is oversexed and I say --
	spay her!

			MOTHER 
		(slowly rises to her feet
		 and in a trembling voice)
	Over... my... dead... body!

A long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson stare at
Mother in surprise. She stares at the Doctor with fire in her
eyes. He seems already to shrink a little. Finally she speaks
with a calm fury.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	Are you human beings or are you
	some kind of male monsters? Is
	there no limit to which you won't
	go to keep your illusions about
	yourselves?

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(shrinking a little)
	Illusions, Madam?

			MOTHER 
	You'd go so far as to mutilate a
	helpless girl who has no means to
	defend herself, you'd go that far?
	Don't you think I know what you've
	just said and don't you think I
	understand the dreadful and
	revolting crime you've just
	conspired to commit?

Dr. Martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by
the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation.

He opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out.
Mother turns to Daddy.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	I thought I knew you. I thought I
	knew you better, I thought in your
	heart you were a good and kind man.
	Well, I can't believe what I've
	just heard in this room. A
	defenseless girl depending on you
	for protection, and you propose to
	mutilate and destroy her. How could
	you listen even for a moment to
	that sadistic man?

			DADDY
		(slightly shattered)
	Well, now, darlin'... give me a
	chance to defend myself.

			MOTHER 
	I can't believe you really meant
	it, if I did I'd want to die. You
	aren't a male monster, that man is
	but you aren't. Look me in the eye
	and tell me, do you really want to
	take Rose's womanhood away from her
	when it's all she has got?

			DADDY 
	Well, I... I hadn't thought about
	it that much. I was thinking...
	well, it's an idea, the girl is
	oversexed, and...

			MOTHER 
	Rose isn't oversexed, that's
	ridiculous. If you're going to talk
	nonsense, I don't want to talk to
	you at all. Rose is exactly the
	same as the rest of us, except more
	so.

			DADDY 
	Well, I know, more so. That's why I
	was thinking... maybe she'd be
	better off.

			MOTHER
		(with a quiet fury)
	Better off? How could she ever find
	love and happiness, if you did what
	you're talking about? Are you
	insane?

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(rather feebly)
	Now, may I say, I am against that
	particular procedure, as a general
	rule. But in a case of near
	nymphomania, it doesn't seem
	monstrous to me at all, but
	medically advisable.

Both Mother and Daddy totally ignore him. Mother's eyes are
fixed on Daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring
down at the floor.

			DADDY 
	Well, now, I admit... in Rose's
	case, it would be cruel. If Rose
	wasn't attractive and pretty...
	well, it would probably be bad for
	almost any young woman. I don't
	know exactly what I was thinking
	about, the doctor said it and it
	sounded reasonable.

Daddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error like a
man.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	But you're right, darlin', you're
	absolutely dead right, it would be
	an awful and horrible thing to do.
	I'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I
	didn't mean it.

Mother turns from Daddy and walks up to the desk and stares
down at Dr. Martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which
she intends to step.

			MOTHER 
	I will not cry like a woman. If I'm
	upset it's because of what my
	husband said, not because of you.
	You can't make me cry like a woman,
	a woman has got just as much
	intelligence and self-control as a
	man. And you get this in your head.
	If you hurt that girl, I'll hire
	lawyers and sue you for malpractice
	for every penny you have got, I'll
	do my level best to ruin you. Do
	you understand me?

			DR. MARTINSON
		(a sickly smile, he is
		 licked totally)
	Yes, I understand you, but you have
	misunderstood me completely.

			MOTHER 
		(icy cold)
	I understand you perfectly. You
	leave that girl alone, you wretched
	man, or you will be sorry.

			DR. MARTINSON 
		(a foolish smile, as if
		 Mother has paid him some
		 kind of compliment)
	Actually of course I won't operate,
	I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy
	will operate and of course he'll be
	guided by your wishes in this
	respect.

			MOTHER 
	Let him be guided not by my wishes
	and not by Rose's wishes, although
	I am sure they are identical. Let
	him be guided by the wishes of the
	creative power of life itself,
	because that is what has spoken
	through me tonight.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Daddy as he walks up to the window of
the car, hat in hand. A trace of tears can be seen in his
eyes, but when he speaks his voice is calm.

			DADDY
		(philosophically)
	Well, I thought I'd seen the limit,
	but these are the most great, gaga
	epizootics she's ever had.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy and them all. In pale fear, mother
stares at him, uncertain what has happened.

			MOTHER 
	How is she?

			DADDY 
	Fine.

As mother sighs in heartfelt relief...

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of Daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table.

Bright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on
the patio. Rose comes into the SHOT carrying a coffee pot, a
sunny smile on her face.

			DADDY 
	You're looking very chipper this
	morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?

			ROSE 
	Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever
	felt! Except for a big old scar on
	my stummick, I wouldn't even know I
	been in the hospital.

			DADDY 
		(with mild irony, as she
		 pours him coffee)
	Well, we know you were there. The
	bill that hospital sent was
	absolutely horrendous.

			ROSE 
		(her smile fades a trifle)
	Well, I'll pay you that back
	sometime, Mr. Hillyer.

			MOTHER 
	Don't worry about it, honey.

Daddy pauses, seems to be struggling with himself, he is
frowning.

			DADDY 
	Rose... I hate to be mean, but... 
		(another pause, then a
		 little shrug)
	Oh, nevermind, forget it.

			ROSE 
		(in a little sad voice)
	What was it, Mr. Hillyer?

			DADDY 
		(rises)
	Nothing, Rose.

Daddy stops beside her, puts an arm around her shoulders and
with weary irony.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	We all love you, darlin'.

Daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter
and walks out of the kitchen on the patio, as the CAMERA
stays on Rose and mother.

			MOTHER 
	Don't worry, honey, you'll find
	something.

			ROSE 
	I was offered that job as a
	waitress.

			MOTHER 
	Forget about it, I don't want you
	working in one of those honky
	tonks.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the patio. He has eight or nine
gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them
and emptying out the seed. He glances up as Rose walks up to
him, pocketbook in hand. She seems a little sad. But she
smiles at him.

			ROSE 
	Hi, Buddy. 
		(puts an arm around his
		 shoulders)
	How's my sweetheart who never told
	on me when I was bad?

			BUDDY 
	Okay.

			ROSE 
		(picks up a hollowed out
		 gourd)
	Makin' homes for purple martins,
	huh? We had 'em on the farm.
	They're the prettiest things.
	That's what I wish I was, a bird.
	Just fly around catch bugs and have
	a lot of fun.

			BUDDY 
	What are you going to do, Rose?

			ROSE 
	Take a little walk with me, huh?

EXT. HILLYER HOME - GARDEN

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy on a beautiful summer day
walking in the garden behind the Hillyer house. They walk up
to an empty rabbit hutch. The hutch is made of rough lumber
and chicken wire and has cubicles for about a dozen rabbits.

			ROSE
		(as she stares at the
		 empty hutch)
	I guess I'll work as a waitress,
	Buddy. I done that before and it
	got me in worse trouble than you
	could know, but I can't stay here
	no more. Why did you get rid of
	your rabbits, Buddy?

			BUDDY 
	They're dumb things. I got tired of
	them.

			ROSE 
		(smiles, touches chicken
		 wire)
	Did you know when I was a child we
	had pretty near five hundred
	rabbits?

			BUDDY 
	Five hundred rabbits?

			ROSE 
	Yep, we had 'em in orange crates
	all over. It was Daddy's dream. He
	was goin' to get rich raisin'
	rabbits. It was what killed Daddy.
	He didn't drown hisself till a long
	time later after Momma and Lunette
	died of typhoid, but it was them
	rabbits what killed him.

			BUDDY 
	How did the rabbits kill him?

			ROSE 
	He thought he could sell 'em, but
	nobody but country folks eat
	rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got
	no money. We had to eat them dern
	rabbits our own selves. Every dern
	one, and it took about four years
	to eat 'em all up.

			BUDDY
		(a little smile)
	Well, that doctor said you got
	protein somewhere and I guess he
	was right.

			ROSE 
	Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But
	later on after Momma died and Daddy
	wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin',
	I sure would of been glad for a
	little rabbit stew. You know, I
	oughtn't to of told you about what
	Daddy done when I was a child.
	Until them rabbits ruined him, he
	was a real good man, Buddy.

			BUDDY 
	What was your mother like?

			ROSE 
	A saint just like your own mother.
	She's up in heaven right now, her
	and Lunette, there ain't no doubt
	about it.

ANOTHER ANGLE as Buddy and Rose walk away hand in hand away
from the rabbit hutch.

			BUDDY 
	Maybe it was eating all those
	rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.

			ROSE 
	Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to
	me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito
	bite. 
		(stops, smiles, puts an
		 arm around his shoulders)
	I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't
	want sex, Buddy, girls want love.

HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM NIGHT

A shot of Mother and Daddy in the Hillyer living room late at
night. Mother sits with a worried expression on a chair, a
kimono around her shoulders. Daddy is pacing worriedly in
pajamas and a bathrobe. He looks at his wristwatch.

			DADDY 
	It's twenty after one.

			MOTHER 
	I don't understand it. Even in the
	wild days she was never as late as
	this.

			DADDY 
	I'm afraid it's my fault. I made
	her feel guilty this morning --
		(glances around, sees
		 something in doorway)
	Brother, what are you doing up?

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy in pajamas as he enters the living
room.

			BUDDY 
	I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose
	come in?

			DADDY 
	No, she hasn't. 
		(frowns, looks around)
	I think I hear a car.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY

CUT TO a shot of a 1930's automobile in the Hillyer driveway
at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here
DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in
a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him
on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes
are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something
important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated,
almost as if awed.

			DAVE 
		(rather stiffly)
	I want to thank you for a wonderful
	afternoon and evenin'. Can I see
	you in the mornin'?

			ROSE 
		(a bit breathless)
	Yes. Year you can, you sure can.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy peering out of the window of the
living room.

			DADDY
	Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,

			MOTHER 
	Who?

			DADDY 
	You know Dave, his wife used to do
	dressmaking for you before she
	died.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the steps. Happy as a clam, she
turns and waves at Dave in the car, then goes on up the
steps.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of the front hall as Rose comes through the
front door. She is very excited, happy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA follows her as she goes into the living room with
her big news.

			ROSE 
	You'll never guess what happened! 
		(pauses, then
		 dramatically)
	I have met Mr. Right! I been with
	him all day and he loves me, I know
	he does, he loves me and he's going
	to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me
	already!

			MOTHER 
	Well... well, that's wonderful,

	And who do you suppose he is? That

	I bit! He is Mr. Right!

INT. CHURCH - DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS of a wedding in a tiny country church. We see
shots of Rose in a white wedding dress, smiling, happy. Dave
is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives
Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see
Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday
best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees
trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country
minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic
country wedding in a very plain, unpretentious country
church, and...

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic
celebration outside the church by a running brook.

The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then
Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.

			ROSE 
	And now Waski, are you and Buddy
	and Dolly ready for some ice cream,
	huh? Do you like picnics or don't
	you?

			WASKI 
	We like 'em! We love 'em!

			DAVE 
	Well, it isn't a picnic, honey.
	It's a barbecue.

			ROSE
		(a little smile)
	Okay.

			DAVE 
	A picnic doesn't involve roast
	meat, hon. At a barbecue you have a
	lot of roast meat.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy as he stares pensively at Dave.
The CAMERA stays on him as we hear VOICES OVER. Rose is
happy, Dave phlegmatic.

			ROSE (V.O.) 
	Well, all I know is there's ice
	cream. And I'm gonna have me a
	plate right now!

			DAVE (V.O.)
	Better wait, hon. It'll spoil your
	appetite. Have some barbecue first.

has no expression on his face at all.

	Well, we are off to Savannah, Mr.
	Hillyer. No more police work, I'm
	getting in the construction field.

			DADDY 
	Good luck, Dave. And good luck to
	you, too, Rosebud.

			ROSE

	Oh, Mr. Hillyer! I just can't stand

Daddy starts the Model A.

see Doll and Waski solemn on the back seat, but Buddy is not
visible.

			DADDY 
	Well, thank God we are rid of her
	at last. And the best thing of all
	is that she's happy. The little nut
	is happy, she found Mr. Right in
	the nick of time!

			MOTHER 
	Well, yes, she's happy. Of course
	Dave doesn't have her life force,
	not at all. There isn't much
	furniture in his house, just a
	table and one or two chairs,
	whereas Rose has furniture coming
	out of the windows.

			DADDY 
	Honey, he is Mr. Right.

			MOTHER 
		(slowly nods)
	Yes, I think so. He adores her,
	it's almost pitiful the way he
	worships her. I just hope she isn't
	too much for him.

Mother pauses, frowning, she has her doubts, looks over her
shoulder.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	What do you think, Brother?

Mother frowns in surprise.

CUT TO a POV shot of Buddy on the back seat of the car. Now
it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. Be is
lying down on the seat of the car with his Sunday coat pulled
over his head.

the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.

			MOTHER (CONT'D)
	What's the matter with him?

			DOLL 
		(seems awed, staring down
		 at Buddy)
	I don't know. I think he's cryin'!

CUT TO ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother, from the front as she slowly
turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. The shot is also on
Daddy. They both stare ahead in pensive silence. Finally
Mother speaks.

END OF FLASHBACK

INT./EXT. HERTZ CAR ON INTERSTATE - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer behind the wheel of the Hertz car. He is
staring pensively ahead, a faint trace of tears in his eyes.
It is a very faint trace, a look of mild irony and amusement
is on his face.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(dryly, to himself)
	Mr. Right. Dave Wilkie.

Willcox slowly shakes his head.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - INTERSTATE EXIT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it takes a turn-off from an
Interstate.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - BUSTLING CITY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it drives into a rather
bustling little Southern city that does not look at all like
the "Glenville" we have seen. A lot of traffic, new roads,
filling stations, prosperity. It could be Rome, Georgia as it
is today.

EXT. CAR PAST HOLIDAY INN - DAY

ANOTHER SHOT of the red Ford going past a modern Holiday Inn
in the city.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

ON the red Ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of
the old Hillyer home.

But insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic
from the past.
Maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the
place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he gets out of the red Ford and
walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in
hand.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer at the front door. He tries the knob,
opens the door and goes inside.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he glances into the
living room. The room looks the same but different -it is
musty, dim.

Willcox Hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and
the CAMERA follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into
Mother's old bedroom-study. This room is quite different. The
four poster is gone. The room is dusty, musty, dark.
Magazines are on the floor in a ring around Mother's old
study chair. We see "male" things. It is apparent Daddy lives
alone in this room.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall
back to the kitchen.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

He looks around. No one is there. He glances at a modern
refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape, glances with a
frown at dishes in the sink unwashed. He goes on out to the
patio.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table
on the patio. Daddy now is a very old man, but his
personality and style are the same as ever. He looks up with
a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio.

			DADDY 
	Well, you rascal, where'd you come
	from?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Hello, Daddy. How are you?

			DADDY 
	About as good as can be expected
	with one foot in the grave. Good to
	see you, son. 
		(they shake hands)
	Did you bring any of that Yankee
	whisky with you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's
	Scotch.

			DADDY 
	It's Yankee whisky to me.

Daddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	How do you stand it up there, boy,
	in all that ice and snow? What are
	you, a polar bear?

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they enter the
kitchen. The former opens his travel bag and takes out a
bottle of Teacher's.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	I can use a drink after the plane
	ride I had.

			DADDY 
	Your wife and children are back in
	New Hampshire in the snow?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a little smile; it is
		 summer, there couldn't be
		 snow in New Hampshire)
	Yeah, they're in the snow.

Willcox opens whisky, looks for glasses in the dusty familiar
cupboard.

			DADDY
	Are they polar bears, too?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(frowns at cupboard)
	Good God, the way you live here.
	This place hasn't been dusted since
	Mother died. Look at that goddamned
	refrigerator.

			DADDY 
	Got another twenty years in it,
	boy. 
		(something seems to be
		 bothering him)
	By the way, son, do you recall
	Rose, that pretty blonde girl who
	came to our house way back in 1935
	or 1936 and caused such a damnable
	commotion.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(frowns, turns and stares
		 at him)
	Of course I recall Rose. In fact
	I've been thinking of no one else
	for the last hour and a half.

			DADDY 
	How could that be, son?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Dave Wilkie of all people was
	sitting by me on the plane -- her
	first husband. It's funny you would
	mention Rose. Did you hear from
	her?

Willcox pours out whisky.

			DADDY 
		(casually)
	Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
	You'll have the back bedroom, son,
	Mother's old art room. Just be
	careful going down the stairs you
	don't break your Yankee neck.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they walk with
their drinks out to the patio.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	What's all this about Rose? What do
	you mean, you heard from her in a
	manner of speaking?

			DADDY 
	Oh, I heard from her, I got a
	letter from her, she's fine. But
	there is some sad news.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	What sad news? Did her cancer come
	back?

			DADDY 
	Oh, no, no, she got all over that.
	Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Is her husband sick or something?

			DADDY 
	No, it's another thing. I was going
	to write you about it, but since
	you were coming down anyway I
	thought I'd wait till you got here.
	What did Dave Wilkie have to say?

ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they
sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not
disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual
and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news
really is.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	The pitiful son of a bitch said
	Rose was a nymphomaniac.

			DADDY 
	Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed
	you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	You're damn right it incensed me,
	the miserable bastard. He also said
	the kikes and the niggers have
	taken over Washington. D.C.

			DADDY
		(nods somberly)
	Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's
	pitiful like you say. When he lost
	Rose it ruined the man, it
	destroyed him totally when he lost
	Rose.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	He didn't lose her, he threw her
	away.

			DADDY 
	Yes, I guess he did. He threw her
	away and it was the mistake of his
	life.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(staring off pensively
		 into space)
	You know, I don't know this town
	any more. All this traffic, new
	buildings, prosperity...
		(pauses, almost as if in
		 pain)
	Where have the years gone, Daddy?
	Where is the little town I knew as
	a boy?

			DADDY 
	At rest in the creative universe
	with Mother, son.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a little smile)
	That's what she would say herself.

			DADDY
		(simply, he is not
		 emoting)
	A wonderful woman, boy.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	It always gives me a funny feeling
	to come home. Dear old Southland.
	Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --
		(a fond little smile)
	-- except you, you're still here.

			DADDY 
		(matter-of-factly)
	Not for long, boy. I've outstayed
	my welcome already.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	It's funny you would mention Rose,
	I was thinking about her all the
	way up in the car.
		(gives him a glance)
	Or maybe it isn't so funny.

			DADDY 
		(as if in previous
		 thought)
	I'm older than hell, boy. But this
	Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll
	say that.

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	All right, Daddy. We have our
	drink, we're out on the patio, you
	have prepared me for it. Rose's
	cancer has come back, hasn't it?

			DADDY 
		(simply, quietly)
	No, son, she is dead. 

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(numb with shock, for a
		 moment can't speak or
		 think)
	Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she
	died?

			DADDY 
	I am afraid so, son. About a week
	ago. Her husband phoned me, she had
	asked him to call me if anything
	happened.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in awful shock)
	But... but how? She was young! Rose
	wasn't old!

			DADDY 
	She was fifty-six, son. Of course
	she didn't look it, nowhere near
	it. The cancer came back, I'm
	afraid I fibbed about that. But it
	was very quick, son. She was in the
	hospital only two weeks, and the
	last week she didn't know anything.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in distress, a slightly
		 choked voice)
	Excuse me, I'll be right back.

Willcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across
the patio to the kitchen door.

SHOT OF THE PATIO

ON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his
refreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face
is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Well, you have knocked me for a
	hell of a loop, old man. A hell of
	a loop.

			DADDY 
		(simply)
	I know. You loved her. So did I. It
	was an awful shock to me, too. An
	awful shock. Rose was so alive it's
	hard to believe.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	I can't believe it, Daddy. I know
	it must be true, but I can't
	believe it.

			DADDY 
	It's true, son. The girl with the
	cornflower eyes is dead, she is no
	more,

Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on
himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful
feeling is behind his words.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	She got cancer of the breast, was
	operated on and had a seven-year
	recovery, then after a brief
	illness passed on in her sleep, as
	the man with whom she'd lived in
	beautiful love and harmony for
	twenty-five years held her hand.
	That is what happened, son, and God
	rest her lovely soul!

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts
to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his
teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.

ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.

			DADDY (CONT'D)
	And now, if you are through with
	that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the
	Holiday Inn and get some dinner.

SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER AND DADDY

as they walk toward the red rental Ford. Daddy uses a cane.
He is a very old man. Willcox Hillyer looks in pain, he
grimaces as they walk along.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?

			DADDY 
	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd
	want to?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	That's a hell of a thing to say.
	Why, Rose?

			DADDY 
		(stops and firmly)
	Now look, boy, get a grip on
	yourself. Rose had a good life. She
	found her. Right, didn't she? She
	triumphed over everything, what are
	you blubbering about?

			WILLCOX HILLYER
	I'm not blubbering.

driveway.

seen.

SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER

in deep gloom. Daddy eyes him and now relents. We see
sympathy in his face.

			DADDY 
		(gently)
	Rose isn't dead, son. Not really.
	Some of us die, but some of us
	don't. Rose lives. As long as some
	little girl somewhere gets herself

                 REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE

                           by

                     Stewart Stern




                     CAST OF CHARACTERS

                        JIM'S FAMILY

JIM'S GRANDMA: A chic, domineering woman in her sixties who
      has made her son Frank dependent upon her for every
      breath he takes.  She is the irritant in the
      household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of
      Frank's marriage.

JIM'S FATHER: Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been
      able to have fun.  He is anxious to be a real father
      to Jim, but has never learned how.

JIM'S MOTHER: Tense and immature, she has never found the
      husband she married.  Upset by the presence of her
      mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless
      man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on
      her son.

JIM: The angry victim and the result.  At seventeen he is
     filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because
     of his "nowhere" father, he does not know how to be a
     man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates
     destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a
     girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness.

                        JUDY'S FAMILY

JUDY'S FATHER: a junior partner in a law firm.  Boyish,
       attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by
       the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only
       recourse is to criticize her.

JUDY'S MOTHER: Self-centered and frightened by the coming of
       middle-age.  She feels that Judy's blossoming youth
       is threatening her wifely position as the desirable
       object of the husband's attentions.

JUDY: The victim and the result.  At sixteen, she is in a
      panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his
      love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her
      to invite the attention of other men in order to
      punish him.

BEAU: Judy's brother.  Because he is very young he is a
      danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily--
      certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable
      in giving it.

PLATO: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a
       traveling mother--he feels himself the target of
       desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute
       family for himself so that he need no longer feel
       cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly
       protection and warmth he needs and cannot find.

BUZZ: A sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out
      aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order
      to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was
      probably rejected by both parents and must constantly
      court danger and must constantly court danger in order
      to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth.

                          THE KIDS

HELEN, CRUNCH, MOOSE, GOON, CHICK, COOKIE, MIL: All
       searching for recognition in the only way available
       to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at
       home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order
       to bear the chaos they feel inside.  They are
       soldiers in search of an enemy.

FADE IN.

A deep night sky.  Matte shot.  Camera searches slowly
upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is
heard sounding the strokes of midnight.

On the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky
Way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of
Easter singing to arise.  The hymn is sung by the crude,
unmatched voices of children.  Camera pans down to include:

Spire of a church.  Camera continues its downward pan as the
singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the
source of the singing.  Camera pans off window to show--

Long shot.  City.  Night.  Suddenly revealed--crisp and
sparkling with lights.  Camera pans down and over:

A lonely street full of parked cars.  The singing diminishes
but a thread of it remains.  A car has just parked.  The
headlights snap off.  A MAN emerges whistling the same
melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat.  He slams
the door and starts down the street in the direction of a
house with bright windows.  He must pass an empty lot full
of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two
street lights.

As the MAN walks by the lot, still whistling, a GROUP OF
FIGURES rises silently from the grass, figures who have been
lying in concealment until now.  They step noiselessly onto
the pavement and follow the MAN.  At the sound of their
boots the whistling stops.

The MAN glances behind him and sees the figures walking
after him, filling the pavement.  A street light shows them
to be boys and girls and all quite young.  The MAN moves on
more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases.  He
begins to run toward the lighted house and the following
steps run too.  Suddenly he stops under the next street
light and turns to face the figures.  They are upon him and
around him quickly.  Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of
the boys grins.  His name is BUZZ.  He is big and filled
with an awareness of his own masculinity.

                         BUZZ
                   (friendly, cool)
            That was pretty what you were
            whistling.  Whistle some more.

The MAN whistles a nervous phrase, trying to make a joke of
the situation which he doesn't understand.

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing; suddenly)
            You got a cigarette?

                         MAN
            Oh, I think so--

The MAN fumbles in his pocket, finds a pack and drops it in
his nervousness.  The FIGURES wait until he picks it up.  He
offers one to BUZZ.

                         MAN
                   (continuing)
            Filter tips.

                         BUZZ
                   (smiling, encouraging)
            You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad.

Smiling uncertainly, the MAN puts the cigarette in his mouth.
BUZZ, still smiling, takes out a packet of wooden matches.

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing)
            I'll light it for you, Dad.

BUZZ ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a
second, searching it.  Then he ignites the whole box under
his nose.  The MAN shrieks, and his packages fall.  BUZZ
slaps him sharply, his smile gone.

The camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds
on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its
wrappings.  It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then
runs down.

The feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey.
Then camera rises to show that the man has disappeared.
There is a moment of awful stillness, then we see a boy
coming down the street alone.  He is quite drunk, and he
slips once.  This is JIM, a good-looking kid of seventeen
with a crew-cut and wearing a good suit.  The spilled
packages on the pavement stop him.  He bends down to see
what they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the
wreckage.  He smiles and winds it up.  He sets it on the
sidewalk and sits down.  He watches it dance for a moment,
happily.  A siren is heard distantly, growing louder.  JIM
pays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and
releases it for its dance.

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE: "REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE" STARRING ____ as
siren rises piercingly close, and JIM looks up, we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Close shot.  Throbbing light of police car.  Night.  The
siren screaming wildly, then dying.  The sound of brakes.
Camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the
entrance of a Precinct Station.  Two officers dismount,
bearing between them the struggling JIM.  They bear him up
the steps and in through the double doors.

Inside precinct station. Reception area.  A large open space
onto which several corridors converge.  In the middle is a
Sergeant's desk, really a quadrangular counter in the center
of which the SERGEANT stands.  There are a few glass-walked
interviewing rooms which open off the area, and several
benches lining the walls.  The scene is one of confusion,
activity and waiting.  Phones ring.  The arrested pass in
custody of officers.  Present among others at JIM's entrance
are: JUDY, who is blonde and sixteen.  She sits on a crowded
bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness.  On a
bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty
little Mexican children without shoes or socks.  The oldest
is a BOY of four who is protecting his little SISTER who in
turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her.
Standing at a corner of the desk is a docile, undersized boy
of fifteen named JOHN "PLATO" CRAWFORD.  He is shivering.
With him is a large NEGRO WOMAN, his maid.  JIM comes
through the doors and is led to the desk.  One of the
officers presents a brief report to the SERGEANT, who
examines it.

                         SERGEANT
            Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth
            Street?

                         OFFICER
            No.  Plain drunkenness.

                         SERGEANT
            This says he was picked up there.

                         OFFICER
            They had him on the carpet for an
            hour at Headquarters.  He's clear.
            Plain drunkenness.

                         SERGEANT
            Young squirt.  All right--You want
            to lean him against something?
            Stand him over there.

The officer leads JIM to JUDY's bench and stands him against
the wall beside it.

JIM is frisked, a look of prayer on his upturned face.  The
OFFICER finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take
it, but when JIM asks to keep it, the OFFICER hands it back
and moves away.  Another officer enters and leads the
prisoner who is sitting next to JUDY into another room.  JIM
sits beside her.  He smiles at her but receives only a
chilling look.  He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing
on the floor, but she is not amused.  Camera pans to show
others reacting to the monkey with pleasure.  We see PLATO
look up and smile a little.  Camera stops on the MEXICAN
CHILDREN who are smiling too.  A bald JUVENILE OFFICER named
GENE, squats before them, smiling.

                         GENE
            You going to tell me your name now?

The little boy shakes his head.

                         LITTLE BOY
                   (touching GENE's bald pate)
            Where's your hair?

                         GENE
            It's all gone.

                         LITTLE BOY
            Did you get a haircut?

                         GENE
            No--it just fell out!

                         LITTLE BOY
                   (sympathetically)
            Aw--

GENE laughs as another Juvenile Officer enters and pauses to
look at the children.  His name is RAY.

                         RAY
            What gang does he belong to?

                         GENE
            Give him a couple of years.

                         RAY
            Where's your mamma, honey?

                         LITTLE BOY
            I don't know.

RAY and GENE exchange looks, then RAY moves across to JUDY--
camera following.  He looks down at her, consults the file
in his hand.

                         RAY
            Judy--we're ready for you now.

                         JUDY
                   (a mumble)
            He hates me.

                         RAY
            What?

                         JUDY
            He hates me.

She rises.  RAY leads her to one of the glass-walled offices.
Camera moves with them.  JIM watches them go.

                         RAY
            What makes you think he hates you,
            Judy?

                         JUDY
            I don't think.  I know.  He looks
            at me like I'm the ugliest thing in
            the world.  He doesn't like my
            friends--he--

RAY leads her into the office.

Inside small office as JUDY comes in, RAY following.  He
indicates a chair for her while he sits down behind a desk.

                         JUDY
                   (continuing)
            He doesn't like anything about me--
            he calls me--he calls me--

She starts to cry.  She doesn't hide it, but keeps wiping
the tears with the palms of her hands.
                         RAY
            He makes you feel pretty unhappy?

                         JUDY
                   (crying)
            He calls me a dirty tramp--my own
            father!

                         RAY
            Do you think your father means that?

                         JUDY
            Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe
            he doesn't mean it but he acts like
            he does.  We're altogether and
            we're going to celebrate Easter and
            catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So
            I put on my new dress and I came
            out and he--

                         RAY
            That one?

                         JUDY
            Yes--he started yelling for a
            handkerchief--screaming.  He
            grabbed my face and he rubbed all
            my lipstick off--he rubbed till I
            thought I wouldn't have any lips
            left.  And all the time yelling at
            me--that thing--the thing I told
            you he called me.  Then I ran out
            of the house.

                         RAY
            Is that why you were wandering
            around at one o'clock in the morning?

                         JUDY
            I was just talking a walk.  I tried
            to call the kids but everybody was
            out and I couldn't find them.  I
            hate my life.  I just hate it.

                         RAY
            You weren't looking for company,
            were you?

                         JUDY
            No.

                         RAY
            Did you stop to talk to anyone,
            Judy?
                   (she is silent)
            Do you enjoy that?

                         JUDY
            No.  I don't even know why I do it.

                         RAY
            Do you think you can get back at
            your Dad that way?  I mean
            sometimes if we can't get as close
            to somebody as we'd like we have to
            try making them jealous--so they'll
            have to pay attention.  Did you
            ever think of that?

                         JUDY
            I'll never get close to anybody.

                         RAY
            Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth
            Street, Judy.

                         JUDY
            You know where they picked me up!
            Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near
            there!

                         RAY
            Would you like to go home if we can
            arrange it?
                   (no answer; to WOMAN OFFICER)
            Did you notify the parents?

                         WOMAN OFFICER
            She wouldn't give me their number.

                         RAY
            What's your number, Judy?  We'll
            see if your Dad will come and get you.

JUDY looks up hopefully.

                         RAY
            Unless you really don't want to go
            home.
                   (silence)
            Would you rather stay here?

Camera moves close on JUDY.  She looks up and speaks very
quietly.

                         JUDY
            Lexington 05549.

The wail of a siren is heard.  JUDY looks off through the
glass wall toward JIM.  RAY is heard dialing.

Med. shot.  JIM's bench.  JIM sits with his head back, eyes
closed.  As the siren mounts louder, JIM opens his mouth and
imitates it--a long, forlorn wail.

Med. shot, PLATO and NEGRO WOMAN.  PLATO smiles faintly and
moves out toward JIM, NEGRO WOMAN following.  Camera pans
with them.  PLATO sits by JIM.  She stands over them.  JIM's
wailing continues.

Med. shot.  JIM, PLATO, NEGRO WOMAN.  An OFFICER moves into
shot.

                         OFFICER
            Hey!

JIM continues for a moment.

                         OFFICER
                   (continuing)
            Hey!  That's enough static out of you.

                         JIM
            Want me to imitate a stupid cop?

                         OFFICER
            Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.

                         JIM
            Yes, ma'am.

The OFFICER moves out.  The NEGRO WOMAN bends over PLATO who
is shivering violently.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            You shivering, John?  You cold?

PLATO shakes his head.  JIM notices him.

                         JIM
            Want my jacket?

PLATO looks up at JIM.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            You want my jacket?  It's warm.

PLATO wants it but shakes his head "no."

Full shot.  JUDY's office.  RAY and JUDY seated as before.
JUDY is still gazing through the glass.

                         RAY
            Your mother will be down in a few
            minutes, Judy--

                         JUDY
                   (clearing)
            What?

                         RAY
            Your mother will be down in a few
            minutes.

                         JUDY
                   (startled)
            My mother?

RAY signals to a WOMAN OFFICER just outside and leads JUDY
to the door.

Outside door as RAY turns JUDY over to the WOMAN OFFICER.

                         RAY
            She's being called for.

                         JUDY
            You said you'd call my father.

                         RAY
            Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.

JUDY doesn't answer.  RAY goes back inside as camera leads
the WOMAN OFFICER and JUDY past JIM's bench.  Camera stops
on JIM, PLATO and the NEGRO WOMAN.  JIM stares at JUDY and
whistles but gets no reaction.  GENE enters and comes to the
NEGRO WOMAN.

                         GENE
            John Crawford?

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Yes, sir.

                         GENE
            Come with me, John.

PLATO rises and goes with GENE, the NEGRO WOMAN following.
JIM is alone.  He closes his eyes, throws his head back and
gives another siren wail as camera moves close on his face.

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
            Jim!

JIM looks up suddenly, scared.  Then he smiles mysteriously
and staggers to his feet.

Low angle.  Tight three.  JIM's parents and grandma framed
in the doorway, frozen.  They are all dressed in evening
clothes.  The MOTHER is a very chic but rather hard-faced
woman.  The FATHER is an unfeathered man.  The GRANDMA is
the smallest, also very chic and very bright-eyed.

Med. shot.  JIM as he faces them.

                         JIM
            Happy Easter.

Tight shot.  The family.

                         MOTHER
            Where were you tonight?  They
            called us at the club and I got the
            fright of my life!

Silence.

                         FATHER
            Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

Close shot.  JIM.  He says nothing.

Close shot.  FATHER laughing uncomfortably.

Med. shot.  JIM.

                         JIM
            You think I'm funny?

JIM turns suddenly and walks to the glass wall of the office
behind which PLATO, the NEGRO WOMAN and GENE are visible.
He looks through the glass partition which separates him
from PLATO.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Why didn't you take my jacket?

Inside office.  JIM is seen through the glass.  He moves
away.  PLATO is still shivering, cracking his knuckles.

                         GENE
            Do you know why you shot those
            puppies, John?
                   (silence)
            Is that what they call you or do
            you have a nickname?

                         PLATO
                   (a murmur)
            Plato.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            You talk to the man nice now, hear?
            He's going to help you.

                         PLATO
            Nobody can help me.

                         GENE
            Can you tell me why you killed the
            puppies, Plato?

                         PLATO
            No, sir.  I just went next door to
            look at them like I always do.
            They were nursing on their mother
            and I did it.  I guess I'm just no
            good?

                         GENE
            What do you think's going to
            happen, you do things like that?

                         PLATO
            I don't know.  End up in the
            electric chair?

                         GENE
            Where did you get the gun?

                         PLATO
            In my mother's drawer.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            She keep it to protect herself, sir.
            She scared without a man in the house.

                         GENE
            Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

                         PLATO
            She's away.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Seems like she's always going
            somewhere.  She got a sister in
            Chicago and she go for the holiday.
            She says her sister is all the
            family she has.
                         GENE
            Where's your father?

PLATO is silent.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            They not together, sir.  We don't
            see him in a long time now.

                         GENE
            Do you hear from him, son?

PLATO looks up as JIM and his family move into the next
office.  JIM smiles at PLATO, who returns it feebly, then
looks away--embarrassed.

                         GENE
            You know if the boy ever talked to
            a psychiatrist?

                         PLATO
                   (smiling a bit)
            Head-shrinker?

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (laughing)
            Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in
            them!

                         GENE
            Well maybe she better start.

Other office.  JIM, his parents, GRANDMA and RAY are
gathered in the small room.  JIM is humming THE RIDE OF THE
VALKRYIES to himself as if he had absolutely no interest in
what is happening around him.  RAY suspects this is
something more than mere disinterest, so lets the humming go
on, in order to discover its real purpose.  GRANDMA watches
everything like a tennis match, reacting with soft little
sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy.  No one pays
any attention to her.  For a moment no one talks.  RAY
watches JIM as he hums.  Then the FATHER shakes his head and
looks up.

                         FATHER
            I don't see what's so bad about
            taking a little drink.

                         RAY
            You don't?

                         FATHER
            No.  I definitely don't.  I did the
            sa--

                         RAY
            He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it
            looks to me like he had more than a
            little drink.

                         FATHER
                   (chuckling)
            Say, listen--

                         MOTHER
                   (to JIM: in intimate,
                   half-humorous disapproval)
            Jim--don't hum.

JIM merely rolls his eyes at her, then away--but continues
his humming.

                         FATHER
            I guess I cut pretty loose in my
            day too.

                         MOTHER
            Really, Frank?  When was that?

                         FATHER
            Listen--can't you wait till we get
            home?

                         RAY
            Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a
            little upset but--

                         FATHER
            Sorry.

                         RAY
            What about you, Jim?  Got anything
            to say for yourself?

JIM stops humming and shrugs.

                         RAY
            Not interested, huh?

JIM shakes his head.

                         MOTHER
            Can't you answer?  What's the
            matter with you anyhow?

                         FATHER
            He's just loaded, honey.

                         MOTHER
            I was talking to Jim.

                         FATHER
                   (to RAY)
            Let me just explain to you--we just
            moved here, y'understand?  The kid
            has no friends yet and--

                         JIM
            Tell him why we moved here.

                         FATHER
            Hold it, Jim.

                         JIM
            You can't protect me.

                         FATHER
                   (to JIM)
            You mind if I try?  You have to
            slam the door in my face?
                   (to RAY)
            I try to get to him--what happens?
                   (to JIM)
            Don't I give you everything you
            want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle.
            A car--

                         JIM
            You buy me many things.  Thank you.

                         FATHER
            Not just buy!  You hear all this
            talk about not lovely your kids
            enough.  We give you love and
            affection, don't we?

Silence; JIM is fighting his emotion but his eyes grow wet.

                         FATHER
            Then what is it?  I can't even
            touch you anymore but you pull away.
            I want to understand you.  Why'd
            you get drunk?  You must have had a
            reason.

JIM stares straight ahead, trying not to listen.

                         FATHER
            Was it because we went to that
            party?
                   (silence)
            You know what kind of drunken
            brawls those parties turn into--
            it's no place for kids.

                         MOTHER
            A minute ago you said you didn't
            care if he drinks.

                         GRANDMA
            He said a little drink.

                         JIM
                   (exploding)
            You're tearing me apart!

                         MOTHER
            What?

                         JIM
            Stop tearing me apart!  You say one
            thing and he says another and then
            everybody changes back--

                         MOTHER
            That's a fine way to behave!

                         GRANDMA
                   (smiling)
            Well you know who he takes after!

                         RAY
            Outside, Jim.  Come outside.

RAY pushes him out the door firmly, and into office vacated
by PLATO and GENE.

                         RAY
            Excuse us a minute?

                         FATHER
                   (very overwrought)
            Sure.  Sure.

GENE's office.  RAY and JIM alone.

                         JIM
            Someone should put poison in her
            epsom salts.

                         RAY
            Grandma?

No answer.  JIM turns away from RAY.

                         JIM
            Get lost.

                         RAY
            Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.

                         JIM
            Wash up and go home.

                         RAY
            Big tough character.  You don't kid
            me, pal.  How come you're not
            wearing your boots?

Suddenly JIM flings himself at RAY who deftly flips him past
and drops him near the desk.

                         RAY
                   (continuing)
            Too bad you didn't connect.  You
            could have gone to Juvenile Hall.
            That's what you want, isn't it?

                         JIM
            No.

                         RAY
            Sure it is.  You want to bug us
            till we have to lock you up.  Why?

                         JIM
            Leave me alone.

                         RAY
            No.

                         JIM
            I don't know why--!

                         RAY
            Go on--don't give me that.  Someone
            giving you hard looks?

                         JIM
            I just get so--
                   (fighting tears)
            Boy, sometimes the temperature goes
            way up.
                         RAY
                   (suddenly gentle)
            Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.

JIM starts crying.

                         RAY
            You feel like you want to blow your
            wheels right now?

                         JIM
            All the time!  I don't know what
            gets into me--but I keep looking
            for trouble and I always--I swear
            you better lock me up.  I'm going
            to smash somebody--I know it.

                         RAY
            Try the desk.

JIM smashes his fist against it, letting loose for a moment.
RAY watches, then sits near him.

                         RAY
            That why you moved from the last
            town? 'Cause you were in trouble?
            You can talk about it if you want
            to--I know about it anyway.
            Routine check.

                         JIM
            And they think they are protecting
            my by moving.

                         RAY
            You were getting a good start in
            the wrong direction back there.
            Why did you do it?

                         JIM
            Mess that kid up?

RAY just nods.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            He called me chicken.

                         RAY
            And your folks didn't understand?

                         JIM
            They never do.

                         RAY
            So then you moved?

                         JIM
            They think I'll make friends if we
            move.  Just move and everything'll
            be roses and sunshine.

                         RAY
            But you don't think that's a solution.

JIM is silent; he picks at his nails.

                         RAY
                   (continuing)
            Things pretty tough for you at home?

                         JIM
            She eats him alive and he takes it.

JIM stares at his family through hole in door.

                         JIM
            What a zoo!

                         RAY
            What?

                         JIM
            A zoo.  He always wants to be my
            pal, you know?  But how can I give
            him anything when he's--I mean I
            love him and I don't want to hurt
            him--but I don't know what to do
            anymore except maybe die.

                         RAY
            Pretty mixed up?

                         JIM
            If he could--

                         RAY
            "If he could" what?  You mean your
            father?

                         JIM
            I mean if he had the guts to knock
            Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy
            and I bet she'd stop picking.  They
            make mush out of him.  Just mush.
            One thing I know is I never want to
            be like him.

                         RAY
                   (interrupts)
            Chicken?

                         JIM
            I bet you see right through me,
            don't you?

RAY shrugs.

                         JIM
            How can anyone grow up in this circus?

                         RAY
            You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want
            some water?

                         JIM
                   (as RAY gets a cup of
                   water from cooler)
            Boy--if I had one day when I didn't
            have to be all confused and ashamed
            of everything--or I felt I belonged
            some place.

                         RAY
                   (giving him water)
            Here.  Look, will you do something
            for me?  If the pot starts boiling
            again, will you come and see me
            before you get yourself in a jam?
            Even if you just want to talk--come
            in and shoot the breeze.  It's
            easier sometimes than talking to
            your folks.

                         JIM
            Okay--

                         RAY
            Any time--day or night.  You calmed
            down enough to go back now?

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            You serious?

RAY smiles and opens the door.

RAY's office as JIM comes towards his MOTHER and forces
himself to kiss her.

                         JIM
            I'm sorry.

                         MOTHER
            All right, darling.

She rises and takes his arm.  They start out through the
door into the hall, followed by GRANDMA and FATHER.

                         GRANDMA
                   (to RAY)
            This was all very unfortunate, but
            he made a mistake and he's sorry--
            so we're not going to have any more
            trouble.  He's always been a lovely
            boy--

                         JIM
            Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell
            another lie you're going to turn to
            stone.

                         RAY
            Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.

                         FATHER
                   (offering RAY three cigars)
            Have some cigars.

                         RAY
            No thanks, I don't smoke.

                         FATHER
            Go on--Give 'em to your friends.

                         RAY
            No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.

                         MOTHER
            Frank--he doesn't want any.

JIM grins at RAY who nods.  They all leave.  RAY looking
after them, shakes his head and lights a cigarette.  We see
JIM and his family pass through the main door.  Waiting to
enter, in the custody of some uniformed police, are BUZZ and
the kids we saw at the opening, sullen and truculent.  As
they march into the lobby and JIM grows smaller in the
distance, the music comes up and out.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

Low angle.  Alley.  Morning.  A rabbit comes running down
the alley followed by a group of young kids, screaming with
pleasure.

As camera pans with the group, the littlest, a boy of five,
stops near us looking after the disappearing group.  The
shouts of the children wane.

JUDY rushes out from a backyard beyond him.  She is carrying
school books and a bag lunch.  She wears a polo coat against
the winter wind.

                         JUDY
                   (yelling)
            Beau!

The boy, who is her brother, BEAU, looks up but doesn't move.
JUDY stops at her gate.  A car careens down the alley, past
him.

Long shot.  JUDY and BEAU seen through a window in JIM's
house.  JIM is in f.g. looking out through the curtains.  He
smiles.

                         JUDY
                   (yelling)
            What are you trying to do, get
            yourself killed?

                         BEAU
                   (laughing)
            Yes!

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
            Your eggs are on the table, dear.

JIM turns from window and passes camera.

Full shot JIM's dining room.  The MOTHER is just settling a
plate of eggs at JIM's place.  They FATHER is seated,
drinking coffee and looking at the newspaper.  GRANDMA comes
in from kitchen.  JIM is neatly dressed in tie, tweed jacket
and slacks.

                         MOTHER
                   (continuing)
            Sit down and eat--you'll be late.

                         JIM
                   (approaching table)
            It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm
            nervous or something--

                         GRANDMA
            It's a wonder we don't all have TB
            or some other terrible disease
            after living in all those smokey
            cities!

                         MOTHER
            Well, drink your milk anyhow.

                         GRANDMA
                   (muttering)
            There aren't so many factories here.

                         FATHER
            Mother--

                         JIM
                   (still standing; he drinks)
            You make any sandwiches?

                         FATHER
            My first day of school, mother'd
            make me eat and by golly I could
            never even swallow till recess--

                         MOTHER
                   (bringing bag of
                   lunch from buffet)
            There's nothing to be nervous about.
            Here's peanut butter and meat loaf--

JIM makes a mouth-stuck-together-with-peanut-butter sound.

                         GRANDMA
            What did I tell you?  Peanut butter!

                         MOTHER
            Well, there's a thermos of orange
            juice and some apple-sauce cake in
            the wax paper to wash it down.

                         GRANDMA
            I baked that!

                         JIM
                   (kisses her cheek)
            'Bye, Mom.

                         MOTHER
            Goodbye, dear.

                         FATHER
                   (rising)
            So long, young fella.  Knock 'em
            dead, like your old man used to!

                         JIM
            Sure--
                   (gets to door and turns)
            You know something?  I have a
            feeling we're going to stay here.

                         FATHER
            And listen--watch out about the
            pals you choose--Know what I mean?
            Don't let them choose you--

But JIM is on his way out.

Full shot.  JIM's backyard as JIM comes out of the kitchen
door into the early sunshine.

                         JUDY (O.S.)
            Come out of the alley, Beau!  This
            is the last time I'm going to call
            you.

JIM blinks, pauses and sees JUDY.  He takes off his tie and
puts it in his pocket.  Then he starts across the backyard,
camera panning with him to:

Full shot.  The Alley with JIM coming out his gate, JUDY and
BEAU visible beyond.  He stops again.

                         JUDY
            Beau!  All right--go to school alone!

She starts down the alley.  BEAU skips after her and starts
tightrope-walking the gutter gravel.

                         JIM
                   (calling)
            Hey!

JUDY glances at him briefly, but continues.  JIM follows a
few yards, but on his side of the alley.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Hey, didn't I see you before some
            place?

JUDY ignores him, but something self-conscious happens to
her walk.  JIM runs across the alley.

Med. shot.  JUDY stopping as JIM enters.  BEAU tight-rope
walking on down the hill.

                         JIM
            Hi.  I saw you before.

                         JUDY
            Bully for you.

                         JIM
            You don't have to be unfriendly.

                         JUDY
            Now that's true!

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            See?

                         JUDY
            "Life is crushing in on me."

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I
            know where it was.

                         JUDY
            Where what was.

                         JIM
            Where I saw you.
                   (no answer)
            Everything going okay now?
                   (no answer)
            You live around here?

                         JUDY
                   (relieved)
            Who lives?

                         JIM
            See, I'm new.

                         JUDY
            Won't mother be proud.

                         JIM
            You're really flipped--aren't you.

JUDY looks up a little surprised.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Where's Dawson High School?

                         JUDY
            You going there?

                         JIM
            Yeah--why--

                         JUDY
            Dig the square wardrobe!

                         JIM
                   (defensively)
            Yeah.  So where's the high school?

                         JUDY
                   (softer)
            University and 10th--Want to carry
            my books?

An auto horn, stuck, in the distance.

                         JIM
            I was just getting my car.  I could
            take you.

The horn approaches, loud.

                         JUDY
            The kids take me.

                         JIM
            Oh.

Another angle.  JIM and JUDY as the car, horn blowing,
wheels into view above them and comes careening into the
alley.  JUDY sees it and moves a step away from JIM.

                         JUDY
            I'll bet you're a real yo yo.

                         JIM
            A what?

                         JUDY
                   (yelling over horn)
            Goodbye!  See you!

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            I'm not so bad.

JUDY is moving toward the car.

Med. shot.  Car full of kids as it comes to a jolting stop
near JUDY.  The boys wear suede coats, leather jackets,
black peggers, boots.  Their clothing is not uniform--it is
the air they assume which is uniform: swaggering, self-
conscious, piratical.  Someone is always combing his hair.

The driver is BUZZ, whom we recognize as the leader of the
stomp gang we met on Easter.  He wears a leather jacket.
With him are CHICK, a slight bespectacled lad; CRUNCH,
BUZZ's first lieutenant; COOKIE, a hanger-on; GOON, a
character; and the girls HELEN and MILLIE.  The kids are
screaming as BUZZ jams on the brakes.  JUDY comes forward.
JIM hangs back.

                         BUZZ
            Stella-a-a-a!

JUDY comes to them quickly, smiling.

                         JUDY
            Steady Marlon!

                         BUZZ
            Wanna make the colored lights go
            around and around?

JUDY and BUZZ kiss ardently and without love.  JIM goes for
his car.

                         BUZZ
                   (looks after JIM then
                   at JUDY)
            What's that?

                         JUDY
            A new disease.

                         BUZZ
                   (a little suspicious)
            Friend of yours?

                         JUDY
            I'm glad they let you out.

                         BUZZ
            Nobody chickened.

                         JUDY
            I heard about it.  You're lucky he
            lived.

                         BUZZ
            They always live.

During this JIM has gotten his car and has driven up.

                         JIM
            Where's University and 10th?
                         JUDY
                   (pointing right)
            That way!

                         CHICK
                   (pointing left)
            That way!

                         BUZZ
                   (pointing up)
            That way!

Simultaneously, the kids laugh wildly.  The radio blares.
JUDy lays her head on BUZZ's shoulder and his arm goes
around her as the car zooms away.  JIM looks after them a
moment, then follows.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Close shot.  Bicycle rack.  Wheels spin in, one after
another and drive straight into their slots.  As the nearest
bike moves in:

Med. shot.  PLATO just getting off his motor scooter.  He
comes forward, passes camera which pans with him then
stops--as the school is suddenly revealed.  Music starts
with a crash and keeps mounting through the following.
PLATO sighs and moves away from us to join the parade of
students filling the Main approach.

Parking lot as cars scream into their places noisily.  JIM
gets out of one and comes forward.  A motorcycle roars by,
just missing him.  JIM stares off and starts to move as
camera pans with him to:

Another angle.  School.  Another crash of music.  JIM moves
toward the parade.

Full shot.  Mid-way down main approach.  A number of kids
pass, gossiping happily as they greet each other for the
first time since vacation.  Camera searches over them and
stops upon our special group moving toward us--BUZZ, JUDY
and the rest, all abreast.  Others must park at their
passage or be elbowed out of the way, staring resentfully,
but not daring to challenge the group's priority.  PLATO
runs forward, past them.

Door from within bouncing from hand to hand as students
enter.  PLATO moves through the door and disappears in a
milling of kids.  JUDY enters with her group and moves on
with them.

Med. shot.  Monitor (inside corridor).  The Monitor is an
athletic letter-sweater boy with an arm brassard that bears
the letters "HC".  Kids pour past him.  JIM enters.

                         JIM
            Hi--can you tell we where I go?
            I'm just starting here.

                         MONITOR
                   (pointing at brassard)
            Mr. Bassett's office--203.  He'll
            tell you where your home room is--

                         JIM
            Thanks a lot.

JIM moves out.

Angle shot.  Corridor.  Shooting past a row of steel lockers.
The clash and slam of doors as kids throw in coats, pull out
books and primp for the day ahead.  PLATO comes to his
locker, which is the nearest, and opens it.

Full shot.  Corridor.  JIM moves toward us from the distance.
Crowded at the entrance to a classroom in f.g. are JUDY and
her pals.  They are sneaking a smoke, passing the cigarette
from one cupped hand to another.  As JIM comes near, JUDY
sees him.  So do the others.  They fold their arms across
their chests and whistle "We are the girls of the
institute"--all but JUDY.  JIM glances at her and continues
on past camera.  A bell starts ringing crazily over the music.

Close shot.  PLATO.  He is straightening his tie in the
mirror.  Above it, pasted to the locker door, is a still of
Alan Ladd.  In the mirror we can see JIM moving past.  PLATO
sees him too.  He wheels around and stares.

                         PLATO
                   (to himself)
            Hi.

The strident music of the students diminishes.  The ringing
of the bell stops.  There remain only JIM's footsteps.

Long shot.  JIM moving off down the corridor.  PLATO is in
f.g. looking after him.  He slams his locker and starts
after JIM, moving at the same speed and hovering near the
wall.  The footsteps of the two boys echo stonily.  They are
alone.  JIM stops at a bulletin board near a bend in the
corridor.  PLATO stops too.

Bulletin board.  JIM looking at the notices.  PLATO drifts
in several yards away and hangs near the wall watching JIM
who doesn't see him.  JIM reads:

Insert: Bulletin board, "Attention All Juniors and Seniors"--
Planetarium field trip--2 pm--Sharp!"

Another angle.  JIM and PLATO as JIM turns from bulletin
board and starts away.

                         PLATO
                   (clearing his throat)
            Hi.

                         JIM
            Hi there.

                         PLATO
            You remember me?

                         JIM
            No.  I don't think so--

                         PLATO
            I'm sorry--I made a mistake.

JIM starts toward camera as PLATO after another look, turns
in the opposite direction and walks away from us, smashing
his fist against the wall as he goes.  JIM stops, full in
camera.  His face clouds, trying to remember.  He turns full
around to look after PLATO, then turns back and continues on
his way.  The footsteps fade.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Full shot.  Planetarium seen from the parking lot--a great
dome crowns it--the city lies below.  Camera picks up JIM's
car maneuvering through the crowded lot.  In b.g. a few
other late-comers are dashing up steps to Planetarium.  JIM
drives into a small lot behind observator, parks, then runs
to observatory entrance.

Full shot.  Lobby as JIM runs through, opens door of theater
and passes inside.

Long shot.  Sky full of stars seen past JIM's head.
Darkness.  This is not our sky.  It is a replica of it
projected onto the dome of the Planetarium.  The stars slide
their tentative ways in an ever-changing pattern.  One of
them is much larger than the rest and increases in size as
we watch.  Music of the spheres is heard--a high threatening
tremolo.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            For many days before the end of our
            earth people will look into the
            night sky and notice a star,
            increasingly bright and increasingly
            near.

JIM looks around for a seat and passes down aisle.  Seen
beyond him is the projector, moving slowly, its great dumb-
bell head sparkling with pin-points of light.  JIM takes a
seat in front row.  PLATO, in the row behind him, moves over
a seat to be nearer.  They exchange looks.

Full shot.  Normal students watching intently.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            As this star approaches us, the
            weather will change.  The great
            polar fields of the north and south
            will rot and divide, and the seas
            will turn warmer.

Low angle.  LECTURER.  A dry, elderly man in a stiff white
collar.  He is seated at a desk, the light from the reading
lamp spilling upward onto his face.

                         LECTURER
            The last of us search the heavens
            and stand amazed.  For the stars
            will still be there, moving through
            their ancient rhythms.

Angle shot.  Students.  Some watching, some taking notes.
An OLD LADY TEACHER in f.g. taps the heads of two kids in
the row before her.  They stop their whispering.  She smiles
at them.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            The familiar constellations that
            illuminate our night will seem as
            they have always seemed, eternal,
            unchanged and little moved by the
            shortness of time between our
            planet's birth and its demise.

Med. shot.  PLATO staring upward.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Orion, the Hunter.

PLATO looks off.

Med. shot.  JIM (from PLATO's angle).  JIM is seated in the
row ahead of PLATO.  His lips are parted as he looks up.

                         JIM
            Boy!

                         PLATO
                   (leaning forward)
            What?

                         JIM
                   (surprised)
            Once you been up there, you know
            you been some place!

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Gemini, the Twins.

Two shot.  JUDY and BUZZ.  BUZZ has his arm around her.  He
is nuzzling her ear.  She is blandly watching the dome.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
            Cancer, the Crab.

BUZZ pokes JUDY who looks at him.  He curves his wrist
toward her, opening and closing his first two fingers like
the pincers of a crab.

                         BUZZ
            I'm a crab!

She laughs.  So do the others.

Med. shot. JIM (PLATO behind).  Seen from JUDY's angle.  JIM
turns at the sound of the laughter, and smiles.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Taurus, the Bull.

                         JIM
                   (in good imitation)
            Moo!

He waits for approval.

Angle shot.  JUDY, BUZZ and group (seen from JIM's angle).
He is in f.g.  They are staring at him.  Nobody laughs.

                         CRUNCH
                   (flat)
            Yeah, moo.

                         BUZZ
            Moo.  That's real cute.  Moo.

                         GOON
            Hey, he's real rough--

                         CRUNCH
            I bet he fights with cows.

                         BUZZ
            Moo.

They turn from him.  JIM withers and looks front.  JUDY
smiles a little and looks away so the others cannot notice
her amusement.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Sagittarius and Aries--all as they
            have ever been.

PLATO leans in and touches JIM's shoulder, lightly at first,
then harder.  JIM turns to him.

                         PLATO
            You shouldn't monkey with him.

                         JIM
            What?

                         PLATO
            He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard
            to make friends with them.

                         JIM
            I don't want to make friends.

He turns back, unhappy at having revealed himself.

Another shot.  JUDY, BUZZ, CRUNCH.  JIM seen in b.g.  The
kids are whispering among themselves and pointing at JIM,
who looks up and notices.  He is getting uncomfortable.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            And while the flash of our
            beginning has not yet traveled the
            light years into distance--

Full shot.  The dome.  The star rushes nearer, looming
larger and larger.  The music rises in tension and volume.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Has not yet been seen by planets
            deep within the other galaxies, we
            will disappear into the blackness
            of the space from which we came.

Two shot.  JIM and PLATO staring upward, cringing back into
their seats as the light on their faces increases.  Music is
up loud.

Full shot.  The dome seen past PLATO's head.  The heavens
grow brighter as the star plummets near.  Music at crescendo.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Destroyed as we began in a burst of
            gas and fire.

The sky is blasted by a wild flash of light.  Music reaches
explosion.  The stars appear again.

Moving shot.  Faces of normal kids watching seriously--very
impressed.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
            The heavens are still and cold once
            more.  In all the complexity of our
            universe and the galaxies beyond,
            the Earth will not be missed.

Med. shot.  JIM and PLATO looking up.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Through the infinite reaches of
            space, the problems of Man seem
            trivial and naive indeed.  And Man,
            existing alone, seems to be an
            episode of little consequences.

PLATO ducks his head down on the back of JIM's chair.  JIM
looks at him.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            That's all.  Thank you very much.

The lights go on.  The rustle and confusion of kids
stretching after sitting too long.  Scattered applause.  JIM
rises and ruffles PLATO's hair.

                         JIM
            Hey, it's over.  The world ended.

PLATO looks up at him.

                         PLATO
            What does he know about Man alone?

Med. shot.  LECTURER as he reaches over and turns a dial.
"Morning Song" by Grieg comes on softly.
Low angle.  OLD LADY TEACHER rising.  She stares around at
the bustling students and claps her hands sharply, but the
noise is barely heard above the tumult.

                         TEACHER
                   (shrill)
            May I have your attention?  May I
            please have your attention?
            Classes will meet at the busses
            outside.  May I have your attention?
                   (to herself)
            The heck with it.

She picks up her coat and bag.

Planetarium parking lot.  School busses and autos, some new
and some heaps, are parked in f.g.  Beyond is the dome of
the Planetarium.  Kids mill about, some already driving off
in their cars.  One bus, already full, pulls past camera.

Med. shot.  Front of bus seen from within.  Driver in f.g.
Kids swarm up the steps and enter.  PLATO is among them, but
keeps looking back for JIM.  PLATO boards the bus and pauses
near the driver to peer through windshield.  His face clouds.

Long shot.  JUDY and group.  Seen from PLATO's angle through
windshield.  They are standing idly in a loose line near
BUZZ's car.  They are looking back toward Planetarium.

Med. shot.  Front of bus, seen from within.  PLATO turns
suddenly and pushes his way past the kids who are boarding.

                         PLATO
            Excuse me.  Excuse me.

Full shot.  Parking lot.  Bus in f.g.  Beyond it JUDY and
the group are visible.  PLATO squeezes out.

                         MALE TEACHER
            John, where you going?

                         PLATO
            I forgot something.  I'll get a hitch.

PLATO moves quickly past the teacher who climbs in.  The
door slams, the bus moves away.  PLATO stops and looks after
it.  The last cars are clearing the lot.  Only JIM's and
BUZZ's remain.  PLATO looks at the small, waiting group.

Med. shot.  The group seen from the rear.  PLATO in the
distance facing them.

                         BUZZ
            What you looking at?

Med. shot.  PLATO wild-eyed with fear.

                         PLATO
            Nothing.

He runs off, camera panning with him.  His goal is the
Planetarium Entrance, visible beyond.  He races toward it
frantically.

Med. shot.  The group looking off after PLATO.  BUZZ,
nearest camera, pulls a switch-knife from his pocket and
pops the long blade open.  JUDY stares at it, then looks up
at BUZZ apprehensively.  CRUNCH sits down on the bumper and
lights a cigarette.

Display lobby.  Planetarium as PLATO rushes in, out of
breath, stops and looks around.  In distance he sees JIM
leaning over the pendulum pit, smoking quietly.  PLATO
doesn't move.  JIM hasn't even looked up.

                         PLATO
                   (screaming as if he
                   were yelling "fire!")
            What's your name!

                         JIM
            Jim.  What's yours?

                         PLATO
                   (a little quieter)
            Plato.  It's a nickname.

JIM nods.  PLATO goes over to him, camera following, until
they are close together, both leaning over the rail.

                         PLATO
            Listen, I told you not to fool with
            them.  Now they're waiting for you.

                         JIM
            I know.  That's why I came back.

                         PLATO
            You scared?

                         JIM
            I just don't want trouble.

                         PLATO
            He has a knife.

                         JIM
            I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing
            swing, will you?  Do you think it
            never stops?

                         PLATO
            No.  It's perpetual motion.

                         JIM
            Oh, I bet some little guy comes in
            here at night and pushes it.  Go-
            go-go!

PLATO walks cautiously to the door and starts outside,
camera following.

Long shot.  Kids (corner of Observatory) with PLATO leaning
out of door, seeing them, pulling back quickly.

Inside display lobby as PLATO pulls back through the door.
JIM seems to have disappeared.  PLATO stares around frightened.

                         PLATO
            Jim?

JIM is looking at another exhibit whose mechanical voice is
heard.

                         JIM
            I'm here.

                         PLATO
                   (coming with him)
            They're still there!

JIM nods.  They watch the exhibit a while longer.

                         PLATO
            Jim--Do you think when the end of
            the world comes it'll be at night?

                         JIM
            No.  In the morning.

PLATO looks up questioning.  JIM smiles and shrugs.

                         JIM
            I just have a feeling.

They start moving, camera leading.

                         PLATO
            If you don't want trouble, I know a
            place we can go--

JIM looks up at him.

                         PLATO
            It's a big mansion and we could
            sneak around there and they
            wouldn't even know.  You could be
            safe--

They turn a corner quickly.

Doors to balcony (from inside) as JIM and PLATO come to them
from behind camera, fling the doors open and step outside.

Balcony as JIM and PLATO come onto it, lean on the parapet.
PLATO points off.

                         PLATO
            There it is.

High long shot.  Mansion. (Matte).  It is falling into
elegant ruin, casting long afternoon shadows on the great
lawns and promenades.

Closeup PLATO looking urgently at JIM.

                         PLATO
            Should we go?

Two shot.  JIM and PLATO.  PLATO's back is to us.  JIM looks
past him and sees something.

                         JIM
                   (quietly)
            The shadows are getting long.

PLATO turns to look too.

Long high shot.  Parking lot.  JIM's car is where he left it.
Into the driveway, like logs driven before a sea, the
shadows of the waiting kids appear and advance until the
kids themselves come into view.  They pause there a moment,
then look up.

                         HELEN
                   (smiling)
            Le soleil tombe dans la mer.

Laughter.  The kids scatter along the wall at the foot of
the balcony stairs.  BUZZ goes to JIM's car, knife in hand,
and stands silently.

Low angle.  Two shot.  JIM and PLATO staring down from
balcony parapet.  At last JIM moves out past camera.

Low angle.  Long shot.  JIM and PLATO.  JUDY in f.g.  The
two boys walk down the stairs.  Camera pans with them as
they reach parking lot level and start walking past other
members of the group.

Traveling shot.  JIM and PLATO coming forward.

Dolly shot.  BUZZ from JIM's angle.  As camera moves in
toward BUZZ standing alone at the car, he suddenly bends
down and slashes JIM's tire.  Camera stops.  There is the
hiss of air escaping.  BUZZ straightens and smiles past camera.

Close shot.  JIM inhaling sharply in shock and suppressed
anger.

Full shot over JIM's car.  Group in b.g. motionless.  JIM
and PLATO approach the car.  JIM stops and looks down.  BUZZ
stands smiling and puts away the knife.

Close shot.  Rear wheel.  The tire slashed, the wheel rests
on the ground.

Full shot.  Car.  Shooting between group and BUZZ toward
backs of JIM and PLATO, who are looking down at car which
rests on its rims.  JIM turns and moves toward group.  He
stops, looks from one to the other and smiles nervously.
Then he looks straight at BUZZ.

                         JIM
                   (wearily)
            You know something?

                         BUZZ
            What?

                         JIM
                   (reproachfully)
            You watch too much television.

Med. shot.  The group and JIM.  JUDY has come to BUZZ,
stands on the wall above him.

                         BUZZ
            Hey, he's real abstract and different.

                         JIM
            I'm cute, too.

Suddenly GOON starts clucking softly like a chicken.  One by
one the others pick it up.  BUZZ, the last, crows.  Silence.

Med. shot.  The group and JIM.

                         JIM
            Meaning me?

                         BUZZ
            What?

                         JIM
            Chicken?

The group gives a quick, short laugh.

Med. shot.  JIM as he takes off his glasses, smiles.  Shakes
his head disapprovingly.

                         JIM
            You shouldn't call me that.

Close shot.  PLATO watching anxiously.

Med. shot.  BUZZ with JUDY watching above him.  JIM enters
shot until he is close to BUZZ's face.  He looks up at JUDY.
Camera closes in until we are tight on the three.  The heads
are nearly touching.

                         JIM
                   (softly to JUDY)
            You always at ringside?  You always
            travel in this rank company?

BUZZ clutches JIM's hair and jerks his head up.  He cracks
JIM smartly across the face with the palm of his hand.

Close shot.  JUDY looking at JIM.  Her eyes clear in
recognition.

Another angle.  The group and JIM as JIM tears free and
comes at BUZZ, slugging.  But BUZZ, with a laugh, leaps onto
the parapet and turns, the knife in his hand again.  JIM
stops short.  The group and PLATO move in around him.

                         JIM
            I thought only punks fought with
            knives.

                         BUZZ
            Who's fighting?  This is the test,
            man.  It's a crazy game.

                         HELEN
            Les jeux de courage!

Close-up.  CRUNCH.  He is smiling.  His arms are around the
shoulders of the kids who flank him.

                         CRUNCH
                   (wetting his lips)
            Machismo.  Machismo.

Med. shot.  Group.

                         JIM
            Machismo?

                         BUZZ
            Somebody find him a knife.

Close shot.  PLATO seen between heads of MIL and COOKIE.
COOKIE holds up a switch knife and tosses it over into the
circle.

                         PLATO
            Jim!

Full shot.  Circle as the knife falls at JIM's feet.  JIM
stoops and picks up his weapon, then faces BUZZ.  Then he
springs his blade.

                         BUZZ
            You know the action?  No cutting.
            Just sticking--jab real cool.

BUZZ hops from the parapet.  They begin stalking each other.
BUZZ slides his knife from hand to hand trying to hypnotize
JIM.  Suddenly he pokes out and pricks JIM's shirt.  The
group sighs "Ole!" JIM makes no effort at self-defense.
Silence.  BUZZ pricks JIM again, "Ole!"

                         BUZZ
                   (as he maneuvers)
            What you waiting on, Toreador?  I
            thought you wanted some action!

JIM cuts out half-heartedly.

                         BUZZ
            Big brave bull.  Hah!  Toro!  Hah!
            Hah!

                         GOON
            Moo!

                         BUZZ
            Come on--Fascinate us.  Impress us.
            What's happening?  Let's go!

                         JIM
            I don't want trouble.
                         BUZZ
                   (furious suddenly)
            You crud chicken!  You're wasting
            our time!

BUZZ viciously slaps JIM across the face.  JIM lashes out
and misses.  BUZZ hops back.

                         BUZZ
            Yeah--that's pretty close.  How
            about a little closer, Toreador?
            Cut off a button and you get to
            join the club!

Outside entrance of parking lot.  A uniformed GUIDE of
middle-age stares past camera.  Cries of "Ole," are heard in
the distance.

                         GUIDE
                   (turning)
            Mr. Minton!  Mr. Minton!  Trouble!

The LECTURER appears running.  He stops short at what he
sees, and blinks in the sunlight.

                         GUIDE
            Look.  There's your audience.

                         LECTURER
            Oh, I don't think so.  From the
            school?

Inside circle.  JIM is covered with sweat and about to drop.
He is getting the worst of it, still refusing to defend
himself.

Close shot.  PLATO.  He is looking on in despair.

                         GROUP
            Ole!  Ole!

Suddenly, with a cry, PLATO pushes through.

Inside circle as PLATO comes through.  His eyes are wild.
He holds a tire chain in his hand.

                         MIL
            Buzzy!  Look out!  He's got a chain!

                         BUZZ
                   (smiling as he sees PLATO)
            Hey!  Chicken Little!
BUZZ trips PLATO quickly and kicks him while he's down.
CRUNCH grabs the chain.

                         JIM
            All right--you want it, you got it!

Suddenly JIM transforms.  He bores forward expertly--pricks
BUZZ again and again.  Cries of Ole greet him.  BUZZ is
surprised.

Full shot.  Group.  We hear only the breathing of the
combatants.  Beyond we see the GUIDE approaching swiftly.
The LECTURER trails at a safe distance.

Closeup.  CRUNCH.  He looks up.  His smile fades.

                         CRUNCH
            Honk.  Let's split.

Group as they look off and see the GUIDE and LECTURER
approach.  BUZZ and JIM are both breathing hard.  PLATO is
getting to his feet.

                         BUZZ
            Split for what?  Couple old poopheads?

He folds up his knife and puts it away.  So does JIM.

                         JIM
            You satisfied or you want more?

                         BUZZ
            How 'bout you?  Say the word and
            you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

                         JUDY
            Buzzie--we better get out of here.

                         BUZZ
            What's eating you, Judy?  You want
            him alive?

                         JIM
            Where can we meet?

                         BUZZ
            Know the Millertown bluff?

                         COOKIE
            The bluff, Buzz!  That's dangerous
            up there.

                         BUZZ
            Draw him a picture, Chicken Little.
            Eight o'clock.  Cookie, you call
            Moose and get a couple cars.  We're
            going to have us some real kicks.
            Little chickie-run.  You been on
            chickie-runs before?

                         JIM
            Sure--that's all I do.

The GUIDE bursts in among them.  The LECTURER remains on the
fringe.

                         GUIDE
            All right--all of you--start moving!

                         JUDY
            You mean l'il ol' us?  What's the
            matter with the nice man?

                         GUIDE
            Don't clown with me.

                         BUZZ
            Why'nt you go suck on something sweet?

                         GUIDE
            You think you're tough?  I got a
            son twice your size and I can still
            handle him.

                         LECTURER
            Don't lose control, Mr. Jamison.  I
            think if we just explain--

                         GUIDE
            Explain to these?  They think they
            own the world!

                         CRUNCH
            The world is round!

                         MIL
            The world is flat!

                         COOKIE
            All the world's a stage!

There is wild laughter from the kids as they close around
the GUIDE and start edging him away, up the steps toward the
Planetarium balcony.

                         KIDS
            The world goes round the sun!
            Goodbye proud world!
            I got the world on a string!
            The world's my oyster!
            Hey!  A fish-eater!  Brain food.

They are gone.  The LECTURER looks after them then comes to
JIM.  JIM looks down at his shirt.  There are spots of blood.
PLATO opens it, spits on a handkerchief and starts to wipe
the blood away.

                         LECTURER
                   (smiling wanly, to JIM)
            Sometimes the world is too much
            with us, isn't it, son?  What was
            the disturbance?

                         JIM
            Nothing.

                         LECTURER
            You're bleeding.  Are you all right?

                         JIM
            I scratched my mosquito bites.  I'm
            fine.

LECTURER hesitates.

                         JIM
            I'm fine--thanks!

LECTURER goes.  JIM impatiently closes his shirt.

                         PLATO
            Are you really going to meet them?

                         JIM
            Who knows.  Plato?

                         PLATO
            What?

                         JIM
            What's a chickie-run?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Downstairs hall.  JIM's house.  A single light is burning.
JIM steals in from the kitchen, peers cautiously into the
living room, then starts up the stairs.  A crash is heard
above.  JIM stops, undecided whether to go or stay, then
moves quickly up the stairs, no longer trying to be quiet.

Upper hall.  JIM's house as JIM rises into view at the top
of stairs.  He sees a figure on hands and knees mopping
something off the rug.  Leaklight from the staircase dims
details.  An apron is tied around the figure's waist and its
bow sticks bravely in the air.

                         JIM
            Mom?

The figure straightens and turns around, smiling.  It is the
FATHER.  He is neatly dressed in his business suit but wears
a Mary Petty apron.

                         FATHER
            Hiya, Jimbo.

JIM leans against the wall, shaking his head and trying not
to laugh.  The FATHER laughs unhappily, trying to make it
all seem a joke.

                         FATHER
            You thought I was Mom?

                         JIM
            Yeah!

                         FATHER
            It's just this get-up.  The girl's
            out and I was bringing Mom's supper.

                         JIM
                   (giggling)
            And you dropped it?

                         FATHER
                   (laughing too)
            Yeah!  Shh!

                         JIM
            That's funny!

                         FATHER
            I better clean this up before she
            sees it.

He starts dabbing among the spilled dishes with a wet cloth.
JIM watches him.

                         JIM
            Let her see.  What could happen.

The FATHER continues dabbing.

                         JIM
            Dad--

The FATHER looks up at him.

                         JIM
            Dad--don't.  Don't.

JIM touches his FATHER's elbow, bringing him to his feet.
They look at each other a moment then JIM goes to his
bedroom.  The FATHER goes back to mopping up the mess.

Inside JIM's room as he comes in, shuts the door and throws
himself miserably on his bed.  He writhes as if the pain he
feels were physical.  Outside, radios are heard in the
night--tuned to different stations.  He feels under his
jacket and holds up his hand to the moonlight.  There is
blood on it.  He reaches up and takes his alarm clock and is
setting it as camera glides to his window and holds over the
rooftops.

Full shot.  JUDY's backyard.  Moonlight.  JUDY stands near
camera looking up at the moon.  The radios seem louder out
here.  One breaks through.

                         ANNOUNCER
            Time now for the seven o'clock news.
            Friends, the next time you go
            shopping.

                         JUDY'S FATHER (O.S.)
            Judy.

She wheels around.

Long shot.  The FATHER standing erect on back porch,
silhouetted against a window.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            What are you wishing for, Judy?

Med. shot.  JUDY.  She hasn't moved.

                         JUDY
                   (softly)
            I wasn't wishing.  I was looking at
            the moon.

Full shot.  Backyard featuring the FATHER.  We see him now
as a tall and handsome man.  There is something boyish and
appealing about him.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (singing lightly)
            "Man in the Moon, how came you
            there--
            Up in the sky where you are
            shining--
            Floating so high in the frosty
            air--?
            Oh, say--Man in the Moon!"--

JUDY comes forward, stands below him on the step.  Her look
is adoring.

                         JUDY
                   (astonished)
            How did you know that?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            We used to sing it in school.
                   (smiles)
            Don't look at me with such horror.
            They had schools in those days.

                         JUDY
            But the same song.  I think it's
            fantastic!

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            We were romantic then too--

                         JUDY
            Are you and Mom home tonight?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            No.  Why?

                         JUDY
            Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend
            an evening together for a change.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            With us old creeps?  Come on, we
            have to eat.

                         JUDY
                   (rising)
            Daddy--

He looks at her.

                         JUDY
            Good evening.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Hi.

He turns away and goes into the house.  She hesitates and
then follows.  Something in the moods has changed.  He has
neglected to hold the door for her.

Dining room.  JUDY's house as the FATHER comes to the head
of the table and takes his seat.  Three places are set.
JUDY follows.  She stands above his chair, looking down at
him as he drinks his tomato juice.

                         JUDY
                   (quietly, afraid)
            Didn't you forget something?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            What?

JUDY doesn't answer, but leans down and kisses him quickly
on the lips.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (continuing; shocked)
            What's the matter with you?

JUDY freezes, frightened.  He collects himself a little.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (continuing)
            You're too old for that kind of
            stuff, kiddo.  I thought you
            stopped doing that long ago.

                         JUDY
                   (very hurt)
            I didn't want to stop.

The mother enters briskly from another part of the house--an
attractive, brittle woman of thirty-five.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
            Didn't want to stop what?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Nothing.

                         JUDY
            I was talking to Dad.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
                   (calling to kitchen)
            Bertha!  You can serve the souffle!
                   (to FATHER)
            Fish souffle.
                   (to JUDY)
            You don't have to stand there,
            darling.  Drink your tomato juice.

JUDY slides into her chair reluctantly and unfolds her napkin.

                         JUDY
            I guess I just don't understand
            anything.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to
            change the subject.

                         JUDY
            Why?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            I'd like to, that's all.  Girls
            your age don't do that.  You need
            an explanation?

                         JUDY
                   (very low)
            Girls don't love their father?
            Since when?  Since I got to be
            sixteen?

She half-rises to kiss him again.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Stop it now!  Sit down!

Suddenly the FATHER slaps her.  Even as he does it he is as
stunned as JUDY.  The mother stops eating.  She has never
seen such a display and is shocked.  He tries to control
himself by buttering a piece of bread.  There is a terrible
silence into which BEAU enters in his pajamas.  He runs to
his FATHER's chair, then halts--looking from face to face.
The FATHER puts an arm around him, hugs him almost savagely.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (thickly)
            Hi, rascal.

                         BEAU
                   (hushed)
            Hi.

JUDY rises, weeping.

                         JUDY
            May I please be excused?

She starts out.  The FATHER rises and follows after her.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (softly)
            Hey, hey, Glamorpuss.  I'm sorry.

She leaves the room, interrupting the joke he was going to
make.  He turns back to the table and sits down.  The MOTHER
rises and comes to him.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (continuing)
            I don't know what to do.  All of a
            sudden she's a problem.

The mother stands behind his chair.  She tips his head back
against her body and kneads his neck and shoulders.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
            She'll outgrow it, dear.  It's just
            the age.

                         BEAU
                   (in a sudden burst)
            The atomic age!

The door slams.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
                   (kissing her
                   husband's hair)
            It's the age when nothing fits.

Inside JIM's room.  We see him lying on his bed as before.
His eyes are open.  The alarm clock goes off.  JIM starts as
if shot, then stops the wild ringing.  The time is seven-
forty-five.  He makes no move to leave the bed.  There is a
light tap on the door, then it opens and the FATHER is
there, seen in light from the hall and still wearing the apron.

                         FATHER
            You awake?

                         JIM
            Yes.

                         FATHER
            Listen--I took a steak out of the
            freezer.  I thought we could have a
            real old-fashioned stag party--just
            the two of us, what do you say?

                         JIM
            I'm not hungry.

The FATHER turns away.

                         JIM
            Hey--I want to ask you something.

                         FATHER
                   (happily)
            Shoot, Jimbo.

                         JIM
            Suppose you knew that you had to do
            something very dangerous--where you
            have to prove something you need to
            know--a question of honor.  Would
            you do it?

                         FATHER
                   (laughing)
            Is there some kind of trick answer?

                         JIM
            What would you do, Dad?

                         FATHER
                   (evading)
            I wouldn't do anything hasty.
            Let's get a little light on the
            subject.

The FATHER turns on the light and looks at JIM who is now
sitting on the edge of the bed.  He removes his jacket and
the bloody shirt is revealed.  The FATHER stares.

                         JIM
            Blood.

                         FATHER
            How'd that happen!  What kind of
            trouble you in?

                         JIM
            The kind we've been talking about.
            Can you answer me now?

                         FATHER
            Listen--nobody should make a snap
            decision--This isn't something you
            just--we ought to consider all the
            pros and cons--

                         JIM
            We don't have time.

                         FATHER
            We'll make time.  Where's some
            paper.  We'll make a list and if
            we're still stuck then we ought to
            get some advice--

He goes out, to the study next door.  JIM rises.

                         JIM
            What can you do when you have to be
            a man?

                         FATHER
            Well, now--

                         JIM
            Just give me a direct answer!
                   (pause)
            You going to stop me from going, Dad?

                         FATHER
            You know I never stop you from
            anything.  Believe me--you're at a
            wonderful age.  In ten years you'll
            look back on this and wish you were
            a kid again.

                         JIM
            Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an
            answer now!

                         FATHER
            I just want to show you how foolish
            you are.  When you're older you'll
            laugh at yourself for thinking this
            is so important--

During this, JIM has kicked off his shoes and put on his
boots and jacket and goes out.

Living room featuring stairs.  JIM comes running down the
stairs and out the kitchen door.

                         FATHER (O.S.)
            Jim?  Will you listen?  You can't
            go out till we--Jim!

The FATHER comes down the stairs, goes to the front door and
calls:

                         FATHER
            Jim?  Jim!

He goes to kitchen door, calls again, gets no answer, comes
back into the living room, sees he is still wearing the
apron.  He rips it off and throws it down--then starts for
the stairs.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The Plateau.  Moonlight.  Wind shrieks over the exposed
plateau, which is several hundred yards long.  It cuts into
the darkness like the prow of a ship and ends in empty air.
A dozen cars are scattered about, defining a sort of runway
in the center.  There are twenty kids present, but very
little talk.  Most of them belong to BUZZ's group but there
are a few whom we have not met before.  They stand in small
clots, murmuring and smoking.  The atmosphere is strung
tightly, like the moments before a dawn attack.  In b.g.
near the cliff's edge, are two cars of similar make and
model.  They face away from camera toward the edge of the
plateau.  There are no headlights anywhere...blackout
conditions.

MOOSE, a boy in a leather jacket and cheap yachting cap
stands guard between the cars, his back to us.  His hands
are on his hips.  His legs are spread.  Some girls drift in.

Another angle.  Plateau featuring PLATO as he wanders
through the crowd searching for JIM.  He passes BUZZ's car
where BUZZ, JUDY and the rest are eating hamburgers.  They
have all changed into fighting wardrobe.

                         BUZZ
                   (calling out)
            Hey, Chicken-Little.

PLATO stops.

                         BUZZ
            Where's Toreador?  He beg off?

                         PLATO
            He's not scared of you.

                         BUZZ
                   (laughing)
            Yeah?
                   (to GOON)
            Goon!  You seen that adolescent
            type anywheres?

                         COOKIE
            He won't show.

                         GOON
            Well, you going to wait all night?
            I'm getting nervous, man!  We got
            to do something!

                         CRUNCH
                   (looking off)
            Hey, Buzz!

                         BUZZ
            What?

                         COOKIE
            Over there.

BUZZ snaps on the spotlight again and swings it off.

Full shot.  JIM's car as JIM gets out and PLATO runs to him.

                         JIM
            How'd you get here?

                         PLATO
            I hitched.

                         JIM
            Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.

                         PLATO
            My personality's showing again.
            Should I leave?

                         JIM
            No.  It's okay.

BUZZ enters.

                         BUZZ
            Come on.  Let's see what we're
            driving.

JIM gets out; PLATO starts to follow.

                         BUZZ
            Just him.

                         JIM
            Stay there.

The two boys move away.  PLATO looks after them, hurt, then
goes to side of JUDY and stands.

Dolly shot.  JIM and BUZZ as they come forward.

                         BUZZ
            What you say your name was?

                         JIM
            Jim Stark.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Gundersen.

                         JIM
            Hi.

                         BUZZ
            Glad to meet you.

They shake hands briefly as they walk.  They come to MOOSE
and stop.

                         MOOSE
            Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy.

                         BUZZ
            Flashlight?

MOOSE produces one and hands it to BUZZ who goes to one of
the guarded cars, motioning JIM to come, too.

Closer shot.  BUZZ, JIM and MOOSE seen as hood is raised,
revealing their faces beneath it.  BUZZ explores the motor
with the flashlight.

                         BUZZ
            Looks good.

                         MOOSE
            Clean as a whistle.  They both got
            plenty breeze.

                         BUZZ
            Look good to you?

                         JIM
            Sure.  It's fine.

                         BUZZ
            Okay.

He closes the hood.  Group moves across to other car.

JUDY and PLATO.  The other kids are behind them.  JUDY looks
to see that their attention isn't on her, then speaks
quietly to PLATO.

                         JUDY
            Is he your friend?

                         PLATO
            Yes.  My best friend.

                         JUDY
            What's he like?

                         PLATO
            Oh, I don't know.  You have to get
            to know him.  He doesn't say much
            but when he does you know he means
            it.  He's sincere.

                         JUDY
            Well, that's the main thing--don't
            you think so?

                         PLATO
            Maybe next summer he's going to
            take me hunting with him--and
            fishing.  I want him to teach me
            how and I bet he won't get mad if I
            goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really
            James but he likes Jim more.
                   (laughing)
            People he really likes--he lets
            call him "Jamie."

                         JUDY
            Want to finish my hamburger?  I
            only took a bite.

                         PLATO
            Okay.

Full shot.  Guarded cars.  JIM is close in f.g. at wheel of
his car.  BUZZ is beyond, at wheel of his.  Both boys are
gunning their engines, listening critically.  JIM lets his
idle.

JUDY, GOON and group.  They watch in silent anticipation.
PLATO starts away from them.

Traveling shot.  PLATO hurrying away from the group.  He
stops, looking off.

JIM and BUZZ.  PLATO in distance.

                         BUZZ
            Better try the doors.  Jump out.

JIM opens his door.

                         BUZZ
            No--quick, man!  You got to break
            quick.

JIM shuts his door and tries again.  So does BUZZ.  Then
both boys walk forward to the edge.  Neither says a word.
BUZZ puts his hand on JIM's shoulder.

High angle.  The edge of the bluff (process).  JIM and BUZZ
are directly below us.  Under them the plateau falls steeply
away in a sheer drop of a hundred feet to the ocean below.

Two shot.  JIM and BUZZ.  JIM is staring below.  He is
beginning to perspire.  He lights a cigarette.  Without
taking his hand from JIM's shoulder, BUZZ borrows the
cigarette from his lips, takes a drag and hands it back.
JIM takes another puff then tosses it into the abyss.

                         BUZZ
                   (quietly)
            This is the edge, boy.  This is the
            end.

                         JIM
            Yeah.

                         BUZZ
            I like you, you know?

                         JIM
            Buzz?  What are we doing this for?

                         BUZZ
                   (still quiet)
            We got to do something.  Don't we?

Long shot.  JIM and BUZZ with PLATO in f.g.  JIM and BUZZ
appear to him as two close friends.  Suddenly they break and
go, without speaking further, to their cars.  They back up
to the opposite end of the plateau, headlights dark.  PLATO
follows them with his gaze.

Group shot.  GOON and others looking up as the cars glide by.

Med. shot.  JUDY waiting as BUZZ and JIM move into starting
position next to her.  JUDY goes to BUZZ.  JIM is in b.g.--
looking on.

                         JUDY
            Feel okay?

                         BUZZ
            Give me some dirt.

She bends out of sight for a moment as BUZZ goes on talking,
then hands him the dirt.  He rubs it into his palms.

                         BUZZ
            Hey, Toreador!  She signals.  We
            head for the edge.  The first guy
            who jumps--chicken!

JUDY and BUZZ kiss, without much interest.

                         BUZZ
            What's happening?

                         JUDY
            Good luck, Buzz.

She starts out, without kissing him again.

                         JIM
                   (calling softly)
            Judy.

Med. shot.  JIM's car as JUDY comes to him.

                         JIM
            Me too.

She looks at him a moment then bends and hands him some dirt.
Their heads touch for an instant.

                         JIM
            Thank you.

She breaks the look and hurries away.

Long shot.  The cars.  They are lined up in two rows--
headlights facing each other.  JUDY comes into shot.  When
she gets near camera, she stops and turns back to face them.

                         BUZZ
            Hit your lights!

Suddenly the headlights of all the cars come on full.

Reverse shot.  JUDY.  She is in the center of the glare.
Behind her we see the other kids filing out of their cars,
hurrying toward the edge of the bluff.  The sound of the two
motors revving then dying and revving again.

Inside JIM's car.  JIM grips the wheel firmly, relaxes his
hands to rub his palms together and crack his knuckles.  He
grips the wheel again.  Steps on the accelerator, winding
his engine into a roar.  He lets up, looks tensely at--

BUZZ in his car.  His chin juts forward.  He lets go of the
wheel, starts to comb his hair.

Slow pan shot.  Spectators staring off at the cars.  A boy
has his arm around the girl in front of him, his cheek
against hers.  Both are looking off.  Some of the kids smoke.
All are involved in the blasting of engines.

PLATO among the spectators near edge of the bluff.  He is
chewing his lip.  Camera pans down to show that the fingers
of both his hands are tightly crossed.

Close shot.  JUDY staring tensely into the glare.  Suddenly
she raises her hands high above her head.

Close shot.  JIM sweating it out.  He leans forward,
squinting, ready.

Close shot.  BUZZ.  He puts his comb between his teeth and
clamps it hard.  He settles himself for the run.

Long shot.  Plateau.  The cars are in close, seen from the
rear.  JUDY is a small distant figure, arms stretched high.
The exhaust blasts.  Now she drops her arms.  The cars leap
ahead.

Med. shot.  JUDY.  She whirls to see the cars snap by, then
begins running up the center of the plateau between the
lines of spectators.

Full shot.  Spectators.  Shooting over their shoulders as
the cars approach and scream past.

Pit shot.  Cars.  As they approach, gaining speed, and
thunder over the camera.

Inside JIM's car. (Process).  He is tense.

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  His hands hard on the wheel.
The comb is still between his teeth.  He begins edging
toward the door on his left.

Moving close shot.  JUDY biting hard on her finger, as she
runs forward.

Close shot.  PLATO.  Both hands cover his mouth.  The
fingers are still crossed.

Inside JIM's car. (Process).  As he edges to his left.  He
is driving with one hand.  He opens the door, gets set for
his jump.

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  He reaches for the door
handle and misses.  As he raises his arm to reach again, the
strap of his windbreaker sleeve slips over the handle.  He
looks down in panic, then back at the drop ahead.  He tugs
but cannot get the sleeve loose.

Closeup.  PLATO staring.  He shuts his eyes tight and keeps
them shut.

Shooting at backs of the two cars as they race through the
row of lights toward the edge.

Inside JIM's car. (Process).  His face is soaked.  He looks
once toward BUZZ--then ahead.  His eyes widen in fear.  He
shoves left and flings himself forward, and out.

Outside JIM's car as he sprawls forward--into camera.

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  BUZZ leans way forward now.
He seems to rise in his seat.  His mouth opens and the comb
falls out.

Full shot spectators staring in disbelief.  Suddenly a youth
ducks his face into the neck of his girlfriend so he cannot
see.  At the same instant--

                         CROWD
                   (in a single breath)
            Oh!

Rear view.  Edge of the bluff as the two cars go over.
There is NO human sound.

Close shot.  JIM as he stops rolling.

BUZZ's car in flight. (Special effects).  The car soars
through the night, the vehicle of a terrible journey.

Med. shot.  BUZZ. (Process).  Surprise has gone.  He rides
lightly on the thrill of his last moment--then suddenly, his
face twists in a spasm of protest and loss.

The kids staring at his flight.

JIM unaware of the disaster--glad he made it.

Low angle.  Edge of the bluff.  With headlights blazing,
both cars dive down.

Med. shot.  JUDY standing frozen as the spectators shove
past and around her.

Wide angle.  Edge of the bluff as spectators swarm to it,
stand looking down.

JIM on hands and knees, trying to rise.  Legs rush by him,
knock him onto his face.

Long shot. (Special effects).  Both cars plunge into the
ocean below.

JIM at edge of bluff.  He is pushing through spectators.

                         JIM
                   (a harsh whisper)
            Where's Buzz!  Where's Buzz!

PLATO working his way through the crowd.

                         PLATO
                   (calling)
            Jim!  Jim!

CRUNCH.  CRUNCH looks up as he hears JIM's repeated cry.
JIM enters behind him, continuing blindly on his way.

                         CRUNCH
                   (tight fury)
            Down there!  Down there is Buzz!

JIM looks over the edge.

Rear view.  Spectators.  A siren wail approaches.  The kids
wheel and scatter, panicking past the camera.

Close shot.  MOOSE.  Looks at JIM.  Runs.

Close shot.  GOON.  Turns.  Runs.

Med. shot.  JIM seen between legs of hurrying kids.  The
sirens and the pounding of their feet on the hard turf.  JIM
is sitting on the edge of the bluff.  PLATO rushes in, stops
short as he sees him.

                         PLATO
            Come on, Jim!  We got to get out of
            here!

JIM doesn't move.  PLATO grabs his arm and yanks.

                         PLATO
            Get up!  Get up!  Come on!

JIM stands.  PLATO pushes him.

                         PLATO
            Go on!  Move!

They start away, PLATO still pushing from behind.

Med. shot.  JUDY.  She is standing alone in the wind on the
emptying plateau.  JIM and PLATO move past in the distance.
JIM sees her and stops.

Close shot.  JUDY.  She is shuddering violently but there
are no tears.  She seems not to see or hear or be aware of
anything around her.

Full shot.  JIM and PLATO watching JUDY.  JIM moves toward
her, camera panning with him and leaving PLATO behind.  JIM
stands before JUDY until she notices him.  He shakes his
head for all the sorrow he feels, but no words come.
Tentatively he offers her his hand.  After a moment, she
takes it.  She knows only that help is being offered and
that she will accept it with trust.  JIM leads her away
toward the car.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

High long shot.  JIM's street.  Night.  There is no movement
anywhere.  In the house bordering the street a few lights
still burn.  JIM's car approaches out of distance and slows
when it reaches the alley.

Med. shot.  JIM's car as it slows and stops.  JIM, JUDY and
PLATO in the front seat.  JUDY has the door open before the
car even stops.  She is shaking, agitated and withdrawn.

                         JUDY
                   (hardly audible)
            This is fine--

She gets out and starts away, leaving door open.

                         JIM
                   (calling quietly)
            Judy.  Will you be okay?

PLATO looks at him.  JUDY hesitates.  JIM raises a hand to
her in a shy farewell.  She smiles vaguely, then hurries
away from them.

Near JIM's backyard (alley).  JIM and PLATO.

                         JIM
            I got to go in.  You better get
            home too.
                   (touches PLATO)
            Hey--what?

                         PLATO
            Why don't you come home with me?  I
            mean nobody's home at my house--and
            I'm not tired, are you?  I don't
            have many--people I can talk to.

                         JIM
            Who has?

                         PLATO
            If you want to come we could talk
            and then in the morning we could
            have breakfast like my dad used
            to--
                   (pauses--then
                   excitedly as though
                   an idea had suddenly
                   struck him)
            Gee...if you could only have been
            my father...we could...

                         JIM
                   (interrupting)
            Hey...you flipped--or something?
            You better take off...

                         PLATO
                   (suddenly, pleasantly)
            O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my
            scooter.  See you tomorrow.

                         JIM
            Yeah.

PLATO turns, walks up the alley to the street.  JIM goes
into his kitchen door.

Hallway.  JUDY's house.  Three doors open onto it: one is
closed--this is JUDY's room:--another, leading into BEAU's
room is open, but the room beyond is dark: the third, also
open, reveals the bedroom of JUDY's parents.  As JUDY comes
into the hallway, the parents, who are reading in their
beds, look up.  JUDY hesitates, then starts toward her own
room.

                         BEAU (O.S.)
                   (quietly)
            Hello, little cute sister.

JUDY stops.  BEAU appears at his door in white pajamas, a
small ghost.  JUDY looks at him.

                         BEAU
            Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor-
            puss, sweetie--

JUDY touches BEAU's head and tries to smile.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (calling from his bed)
            Beau!  You belong in bed!

BEAU flees.  JUDY turns without another glance at her
parents, and opens the door of her room.

Inside bedroom of JUDY's parents.  As JUDY slams her bedroom
door o.s., the FATHER reacts.  Perhaps, he wishes she had
given him a chance to say goodnight.  The MOTHER, who use
reading glasses, looks up at the slam.  Then she looks over
at her husband, shrugs when she catches his gaze, and goes
back to her magazine.

Inside JIM's living room.  The television is on, but only a
hum comes from it, and the screen is a flickering gray.  The
FATHER sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace, still
dressed but with his collar open.  The sound of JIM's step
in the dining room makes him open his eyes.  Fear of facing
his son makes him shut them again.  The boy comes in, a
bottle of milk in his hand.  Seeing his FATHER there, he
stops short--his impulse is to flee.  Instead he comes in
and looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids, fluttering
in the FATHER's masquerade of sleep, make him seem to be
having a dream.  JIM is torn between his desire to leave and
his need to speak.  He turns off the television quietly,
then lies down on the couch across the way.  He mumbles the
things he would say to his FATHER and the answers he feels
he would get.  The old man opens his eyes once, sees the boy
there, head banging upside down from the couch.  Then he
shuts them again.

Upside down long shot.  Room (JIM's viewpoint).  Suddenly,
inverted in his vision, the MOTHER appears at the head of
the stairs, in bathrobe and nightgown.  She pauses a moment,
then runs down crying:

                         MOTHER
            He's home!  You're home!  You're
            all right!

The camera rights itself suddenly.

JIM as he completes his turn, pulling his head up and sitting.

FATHER as he pretends to awaken with a start.

Full shot, room as the MOTHER hurries to JIM, holds him,
inspects him, kisses him.

                         MOTHER
            What happened, darling.  We were so
            worried.  I was going to take a
            sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till
            I knew you were home.

                         JIM
            I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I
            have to talk to you both.  And Dad
            this time you got to give me an
            answer.

                         FATHER
            Go ahead.

                         JIM
            I'm in terrible trouble.--You know
            that big high bluff near Miller-
            town Junction?

                         FATHER
            Sure--there was a bad accident
            there.  They showed the pictures on
            T.V.

                         JIM
            I was in it.

                         MOTHER
            How!

                         JIM
            It doesn't matter how.  I was
            driving a stolen car--

                         MOTHER
            Do you enjoy doing this to me or
            what--

                         JIM
            Mom--I'm not--

                         MOTHER
            And you wanted him to make a list!

                         FATHER
            Will you let him tell it!

                         JIM
            She never wants to hear.  She
            doesn't care!

                         MOTHER
            I guess when I nearly died giving
            birth to you--that shows how much I
            don't care!

                         FATHER
            Just relax, please relax!

                         JIM
            I told you Dad, it was a question
            of honor.  They called me chicken--
            you know, chicken!  I had to go or
            I would never have been able to
            face any of those kids again.  So I
            got in one of these cars and a boy
            called Buzz got in the other.  We
            had to drive fast and jump before
            the cars went over the edge of the
            bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz
            didn't.  He was killed.

                         MOTHER
            Good Lord!

                         JIM
            I can't keep it to myself anymore--

                         FATHER
            Well, just get it off your chest, son.

                         JIM
            That's not what I mean.  I've never
            done anything right.  I've been
            going around with my head in a
            sling for years...I don't want to
            drag you into this but I can't help
            it.  I don't think I can prove
            anything by going around pretending
            I'm tough any more, so maybe you
            look like one thing but you still
            feel like another.

                         FATHER
            You're absolutely right!

                         JIM
            Are you listening to me?  You're
            involved in this!  I want to go to
            the police and tell them I was
            mixed up in this thing tonight?

                         FATHER
            You what?

                         MOTHER
            No!

                         FATHER
            Did anyone see you there?  I mean
            did they get your license number or
            anything?

                         JIM
            I don't think so--

                         FATHER
            Well--

                         MOTHER
            What about the other boys--Do you
            think they'll go to the police?

                         JIM
            What's that got to do with it?

                         MOTHER
            Why should you be the only one.

                         FATHER
            Look Jim.  Far be it from me to
            tell you what to do, but there's--

                         MOTHER
            Are you going to preach now?  Are
            we going to have a sermon?

                         FATHER
            I'm just explaining what you mean!
            You can't be an idealist all your
            life!  Nobody thanks you for
            sticking your neck out!

                         MOTHER
            That's right!

                         JIM
            Except yourself!

                         FATHER
            Will you wait a minute?

                         JIM
            You don't want me to go.

                         MOTHER
            No!  I don't want you to go to the
            police!  There were other people
            and why should you be the only one
            involved!

                         JIM
            But I am involved!  We're all
            involved, Mom!  A boy was killed!
            I don't see how we can get out of
            that by pretending it didn't happen!

                         FATHER
            You know you did wrong.  That's the
            main thing, isn't it?

                         JIM
            No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing!
            You always told me to tell the
            truth.  You think you can just turn
            that off?

                         MOTHER
            He's not saying that!  He's saying
            don't volunteer!

                         JIM
            Just tell a little white lie?

                         FATHER
            You'll learn as you get a little
            older, Jim.

                         JIM
            I don't want to learn that!

                         MOTHER
            Well, it doesn't matter anyhow--
            because we're moving.

                         JIM
            No!  You're not tearing me loose
            any more.

                         MOTHER
            Do I have to spell it out?

                         JIM
            You're not going to use me as an
            excuse again, Mom.  Every time you
            can't face yourself you want to
            move and you say it's because of me
            or the neighborhood or some other
            phony excuse.  Now I want to do one
            thing right and I'm not letting you
            run away.
                   (silence)
            Dad?

                         FATHER
            Son--this is all happening so fast--

                         JIM
            You better give me something, Dad.
            You better give me something
                   (stops as he sees the
                   emptiness in them)
            Mom?

                         MOTHER
            Jimmy, you're very young--and a
            foolish decision now could wreck
            your whole life.

                         JIM
            Dad--answer her--aren't you going
            to stand up for me?

The FATHER is mute, helpless...  Suddenly JIM screams.

                         JIM
            Dad?

He leaps at his FATHER, dragging him to his feet, hands at
the man's throat.

                         MOTHER
            Stop it!  You'll kill him!  Jim!
            Do you want to kill your father?

Suddenly JIM loosens his hands and rises.  He looks swiftly
at each of them--moves a few steps toward the door, looks
back at them again--then rushes out of the house.  The
parents stand frozen.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Outside Precinct Station.  JIM's car comes to a stop at the
curb.  JIM gets out and approaches the flight of steps
leading up the entrance.  A bare bulb on either side is the
only illumination.  As he mounts the first step, the double
doors above him swing open revealing several people.  JIM
stops short.  So do they.

Low angle.  CRUNCH, MOOSE and their parents.  JIM's back in
f.g.  The boys stare down at him.

High angle.  JIM (from the boys' point of view) as he stares
up at them.  MOOSE's father takes his arm and starts him
down the stairs, the others moving too.

                         MOOSE
            Let go of me--

                         MOOSE'S FATHER
            You want a good crack in the mouth?

JIM starts forward up the steps.  CRUNCH grabs him.

                         CRUNCH
            This place appeal to you or something?

They move down the steps as JIM breaks away and continues up.
He goes through the doors.

Inside doors as JIM comes through and stops.  He looks back
through the glass.  We see the group reach the curb where
their cars are parked.  There is a brief discussion which we
cannot hear, then CRUNCH and MOOSE move off to MOOSE's car.
JIM turns back.  He looks worried as he passes camera.

Med. shot.  CRUNCH and MOOSE.  They stop at MOOSE's car and
look back at the entrance.  The parents are seen beyond
them, getting into their cars.  CRUNCH is near tears with
anger.

                         CRUNCH
            What's he going to pull--

                         MOOSE
            Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him
            up like the rest of--

                         CRUNCH
            You see any cops?

                         MOOSE'S FATHER
                   (yelling)
            You monsters start home.  We're
            going to--

                         MOOSE
            Yeah.  Yeah.

                         MOOSE'S FATHER
            We're following you so better get
            there.

                         CRUNCH
            You see any cops?

                         MOOSE
            No--

                         CRUNCH
            He's going to cheese, I tell you.
            Nobody arrested him!

                         MOOSE
            I think I should go home.

                         CRUNCH
            No.  We're going to bring him down.

                         MOOSE
            Crunch--my father's--You going to
            kill him?

                         CRUNCH
                   (crying)
            You clean out of your head?  Come on!

CRUNCH gets into the car.  MOOSE follows.  They gun the
motor and throw the car into a sharp U-turn.  MOOSE'S FATHER
jumps into his car.  He steps on the starter but nothing
happens--just the empty whirring, over and over.  Finally it
starts, but the boys have gone.

Inside Precinct Station.  Juvenile division.  A desk
sergeant is writing in the record book.  Facing him across
the desk and handcuffed to an officer is a young hoodlum,
very different in appearance from the kids we have met--a
typical duck-tail 'cat'.

                         SERGEANT
                   (spelling)
            W-O-J-T-what?

                         HOODLUM
            O-W-I-C-Z.  Wojtowicz.  What's the
            matter, man?  That's the craziest
            name in town!  It swings!

                         JIM
            Excuse me--but--You know where I
            can find--I mean I don't remember
            his last name--

                         SERGEANT
            Look--can't you see I'm writing?

                         HOODLUM
                   (combing his duck-tail)
            Man, this cat never stops.  He just
            keeps going like Big Jay at a session!
                         OFFICER
            Shut up.

                         HOODLUM
            He's writing a book about me--

                         SERGEANT
            What I could write about you they
            wouldn't print.

                         JIM
            I think his first name's Ray--I
            have to see him.  It's very important.

                         SERGEANT
            What's the charge?

                         OFFICER
            Assault with a deadly weapon.

                         JIM
            Listen--

                         SERGEANT
                   (annoyed)
            He's not here.  He's not at
            Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where
            he is.  He's out on a call and
            he'll be out all night.  How old
            are you?

                         JIM
            My parents know I'm out.  They know
            I'm here.

                         SERGEANT
            Come back tomorrow.

                         JIM
            I'll wait for him.

                         SERGEANT
            Why don't you come back tomorrow,
            son?
                   (to hoodlum)
            Ever been booked before?

JIM turns away, notices a phone on the wall--puts in a coin,
asks for a number.

Bedroom of JUDY's parents.  Through an open door we hear a
radio playing-- a late disc-jockey show for teenagers in
which numbers are dedicated by request.  JUDY'S MOTHER and
FATHER are in bed, FATHER has phone in his hand.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Who wants her?  Who?  Jim who?
            Never heard of you.

He hangs up phone, looks at his wife.  She rolls over in bed.
The FATHER turns off the bed lamp, then sits up, worried in
the dark.

JUDY's bedroom.  It is her radio we have heard.  She turns
off light, opens the door a crack, and looks out toward her
parent's room.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Traveling shot.  PLATO.  He is coming up the walk to his
house.  When PLATO has come a few feet, somebody whistles.
PLATO and camera stop.  Short, quiet whistles come from the
boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk.  PLATO
turns and starts to run, camera following.  He gets to his
door, tries the key, but in his panic it will not go into
the lock.  Suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around.
CRUNCH stands above him.  GOON closes in from the other side.
All very tense and hotted up!

                         PLATO
            What do you want!

                         CRUNCH
            You know what we want.  We want
            your friend.

                         GOON
            We got eyes for him.

                         PLATO
            Listen, you guys ought to go home.
            The cops are cruising every--

                         GOON
            Where does he live?

PLATO reaches up swiftly and rings the bell.  GOON grabs him.
CRUNCH cracks him.

                         CRUNCH
            You better tell us and I'm not
            kidding.

                         PLATO
            My old man's got a gun.

                         GOON
            His old man's got a gun.  What do
            you think of that!
                   (drives a hard blow
                   at PLATO's belly)
            Your friend talked--
                   (belts him again)
            Now you talk!  Talk!

The door opens and the NEGRO WOMAN is there.  CRUNCH sends
PLATO spinning into the house past her.  He falls.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (yelling)
            What you doing!  What you doing to
            him!  You clear out of here 'fore I
            call the police!

She swings at CRUNCH who faces her, challenging.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now!

                         MOOSE
            Let's go, Crunch.

They turn and move past camera.  PLATO gets up off the floor.
We hear the sound of a heap starting.  The NEGRO WOMAN
closes the door.

Inside PLATO's foyer as NEGRO WOMAN bolts the door.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Why you like to mix with bad boys
            like that?  Why you get in trouble
            all the--

                         PLATO
            I have to go out.  I have to warn him.

He starts up the stairs.  She follows him heavily.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            You not going anywhere!  You
            staying home while your mama's away.

Bedroom of PLATO's mother, a lacy affair with imported dolls
on the pillows.  PLATO rushes in, opens the drawer of the
night-table and pulls out a gun.  He checks to see that it
is loaded.  The NEGRO WOMAN appears in the door and stares
at him, turns on the light which illuminates the bed-lamp.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            John!  What you doing with that!
            You leave that be!  Put it down
            before you hurt yourself.  Hear me?

But PLATO moves past her and out of the room.  She turns
after him.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (continuing)
            John!  You stay home!  John!  John!

The slam of a door is heard below.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

JIM's garage.  Night.  JUDY waiting inside.  JIM's car pulls
in, a radio going softly.  He turns the motor off and is
about to turn off the radio when we hear the announcer:

                         ANNOUNCER
            Coming up now another request--this
            time from the boys down at Anna's
            Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement
            of a great oldie in rhythm and
            blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to
            you--from Buzz.

JIM stares at the radio, then turns it off.

Another angle.

                         JUDY
            They'll be looking for you.

                         JIM
            They saw where I jumped!  I didn't
            chicken!  What do I have to do--
            kill myself?

                         JUDY
            It doesn't matter to them.

                         JIM
            You were looking for me, weren't you?

                         JUDY
                   (a small voice)
            No--I was just--maybe--

                         JIM
            I tried to call you before.
                         JUDY
            I thought so.

                         JIM
            Want some milk?

JUDY comes forward.

                         JIM
            That's all I can do when I'm
            nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a
            slug.

She shakes her head.  He takes a sip.

                         JIM
            You still pretty upset?

                         JUDY
            I'm numb.

She is shuddering a little.

                         JIM
            You cold?

                         JUDY
            Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold.
            I guess just about everybody's cold.

                         JIM
            I swear, sometimes, you just want
            to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what
            am I going to do?  I can't go home
            again.

                         JUDY
            Neither can I.

                         JIM
            No?  Why not?
                   (no answer)
            You know something?  Sometimes I
            figure I'll never live to see my
            next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?

                         JUDY
            No.

                         JIM
            Every day I look in the mirror and
            say, "What?  You still here?" Man!

They laugh a little.

                         JIM
            Hey!  You smiled!

JUDY shakes her head--beginning to warm to him.

                         JIM
            Like even today.  I woke up this
            morning, you know?  And the sun was
            shining and everything was nice.
            Then the first thing that happens
            is I see you and I thought this is
            going to be one terrific day so you
            better live it up, boy, 'cause
            tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.

                         JUDY
            I'm sorry I treated you mean today.
            You shouldn't believe what I say
            when I'm with the kids.  Nobody
            acts sincere.

                         JIM
            Why'd you get mixed up with them?
            You don't have to prove anything.

                         JUDY
            If you knew me you wouldn't say that.

                         JIM
            I don't think you trust anybody, do
            you?

                         JUDY
            Why?

                         JIM
            I'm getting that way, too.

                         JUDY
                   (looks at him)
            Have you ever gone with anyone who--

                         JIM
            Sure.  Lots of times.

                         JUDY
            So have I.  But I've never been in
            love.  Isn't that awful?

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            Awful?  No.  It's just lonely.
            It's the loneliest time.

She looks up.  He kisses her forehead.

                         JUDY
            Why did you do that?

                         JIM
            I felt like it.

                         JUDY
            Your lips are soft when you kiss.

JUDY rises.

                         JIM
            Where you going?

                         JUDY
            I don't know, but we can't stay here.

                         JIM
            Where can we go?  I can't go back
            into that zoo.

                         JUDY
            I'm never going back.

                         JIM
            Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO
            showed me before.  An old deserted
            mansion near the planetarium
                   (rises)
            Would you go with me?

JUDY hesitates.

                         JIM
            You can trust me, Judy.

                         JUDY
            I feel as if I'm walking under water.

They start out.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Inside bathroom.  JIM's house.  The water is running in the
sink and JIM's father is fixing a stomach settler.  Gradually
he grows aware of a heavy pounding which insinuates itself
above the splash of water.  The FATHER pauses, then turns
off the tap.  The pounding continues.  JIM'S MOTHER appears
at the bathroom door.  She is seen in the mirror tying her
robe.

                         MOTHER
            Frank?  I'm frightened.

                         FATHER
            What's that pounding?

                         MOTHER
            I don't know.  First I thought it
            was Jim but--

                         FATHER
            He's home.  I heard the car.

                         MOTHER
            Are you going down there?

                         FATHER
            Look--just relax, will you?

The pounding ceases.

                         FATHER
            See?  It stopped.

                         MOTHER
            I still think you should go down.

He goes out of the bathroom, into the hall.

Foyer.  JIM's house as the FATHER comes down the stairs,
turning on the light as he comes.  He reaches the door and
pauses.  The MOTHER stops midway down the stairs.

                         FATHER
                   (through the door)
            Who's there?
                   (silence)
            Anyone there?

                         MOTHER
                   (low; at balustrade)
            Open it.

The FATHER opens the door and looks up sharply.

Close shot.  Door.  FATHER's head in f.g. as he stares at it.
Nailed to the door by its outstretched wings, its head
hanging in an attitude of crucifixion, is the freshly killed
carcass of a chicken.  Low whistles are heard from outside.
The FATHER, frightened, looks out into the night.

Full shot.  Front lawn and street.  Shooting over the
FATHER's head.  The whistling continues.
                         FATHER
                   (hoarsely)
            Who's out there?

                         VOICE
            Where's your son?

                         FATHER
            What?

                         ANOTHER VOICE
            Where's your baby boy gone to,
            Daddy?  We want him.

Suddenly the FATHER slams the door and rushes past us into
the house.

Full shot.  Foyer as the FATHER rushes to the bottom of the
stairs.

                         FATHER
            Look in his room!

The MOTHER disappears.

                         FATHER
            Jim!  Jim!

The FATHER dashes into the living room, then into the hall
again and down through the kitchen door.

Back yard as the FATHER comes out.  He closes the door
quietly and calls in a low voice:

                         FATHER
            Son?

He stares around the yard, then hurries to the garage.
JIM's car is missing.  He looks up suddenly.

Reverse shot.  JUDY'S FATHER seen across the alley wall.  He
is standing in his own back yard.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Is anything wrong?  I'm your neighbor.

Med. shot.  JIM'S FATHER.  He smiles feebly.

                         FATHER
            Oh, no, thanks.  I just wanted to--
            to be sure my garage was closed.

JIM'S FATHER closes his garage door and walks back toward
his house.

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
            Is he there?

                         FATHER
            No, honey.  No, he's not here.

He starts for the house again after a quick look in the
direction of JUDY'S FATHER.

Full shot.  JUDY's back yard.  JUDY'S FATHER watches MR.
STARK disappear, then...

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (softly)
            Judy?

The alley by JIM's house.  PLATO drives up on scooter.  He
checks the garage, sees JIM's car is gone, is about to take
off in confusion, hears door slam in JIM's back yard, shuts
off engine, fixes tie, combs hair, goes in the fence gate to
JIM's back yard.

Full shot.  JIM's back yard.  JIM'S FATHER is coming toward
him.  JIM'S FATHER and PLATO simultaneously say:

                         FATHER
            What are you doing?

                         PLATO
            Where's Jim?

                         FATHER
            I don't know.  Do you--do you know
            where he is?

                         PLATO
            No.  No, I don't.

Closeup.  PLATO remembers about the mansion--then almost to
himself:

                         PLATO
            I know where--

Back to full shot.  FATHER and PLATO.

                         PLATO
            Hope I didn't bother you.  Goodnight.

He runs to scooter.

                         FATHER
            Hey, come back here.  Who are you?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Split screen montage.  It begins with a telephone ringing
alone in the corner of the screen.  As camera moves back we
see that the phone is in an office at Juvenile Hall.  RAY is
standing by, trying to make sense out of the incoming reports.

The other part of the screen lights up and becomes:

Bedroom of PLATO'S MOTHER where the NEGRO WOMAN is speaking
hysterically into the phone.

Bedroom of JUDY's parents.  The FATHER is on the phone.
BEAU has awakened and is crying.  His MOTHER tries to divert
him.

JIM's bedroom.  JIM'S FATHER sits disconsolately on the bed,
the phone in his hand.  He is talking earnestly.

During this the sound of the telephone ringing has increased
to become the sound of many and this has been submerged in a
deep rising riot of sirens whose wail mounts higher and
higher until:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Full shot.  Planetarium.  Moonlight.  A lone siren wails in
distance.  Aside from this, all is very still.  Camera pans
past the dome and settles on an isolated mansion set high on
a hill nearby.  Stone balustrades drop down to sunken
gardens where the grass has gone to seed around a waterless
fountain.

Closer shot.  Mansion.  Night.  A Mediterranean villa with a
large domed solarium which is connected to the main building
by a low enclosed arcade.  A crash and the falling of
splintered glass is heard.

Long shot.  Promenade.  Shooting through pillars of the main
entrance portico, down the long promenade outside arcade.
Two figures, seen in the distance, are disappearing through
a window.  Camera tracks down promenade until it reaches a
broken window through which JIM is just disappearing.  When
he gets inside, he reaches back and takes his leather jacket
which has been spread on the sill to protect them from
splinters, shakes it out and puts it on.  Running footsteps
are heard approaching.  JIM looks out nervously.  PLATO
bursts in, out of breath.

                         PLATO
            Jim!

                         JIM
            Who's that!

                         PLATO
            It's me!

                         JIM
            How'd you find me?  What's happening?

                         PLATO
            They're looking for you!--

                         JIM
            Yeah?

                         PLATO
            Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and
            everybody!  I think they're going
            to kill you.

                         JIM
            We know.

                         PLATO
            They think you told the police on
            them.  They--who's in there?

                         JIM
            Judy.

                         PLATO
            Help me in!

JIM gives PLATO a hand over the windowsill.

Inside arcade.  JIM and JUDY are seen in an entering shaft
of moonlight.  PLATO hits the floor and disappears into
darkness.

                         JIM
            Hey where'd you go?

                         PLATO
            I'm here.  Shut up.

                         JIM
            Come out come out wherever you are!

                         PLATO
            Shut up.  Are you nuts?

                         JIM
            No.  I'm scared.

A match flares and lights a candle on an antique Spanish
candelabra.  PLATO is revealed bending over it.  He lights
the other candles through the following:

                         PLATO
            We're safe here.  I hope.
                   (holds up candelabra)
            What do you think?

                         JIM
                   (gazing around)
            Wow!  Well now-there-then!

His wonderment is justified.  The floor of the arcade is
marble and there are marble benches and neo-Roman busts
lining the walls.

                         PLATO
            Isn't it crazy?

                         JIM
            Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for
            the summer.

                         JUDY
            Oh, Jim!

                         JIM
            No--come on.  Should we rent or are
            we in a buying mood, dear?

                         JUDY
                   (laughing)
            You decide, darling.  Remember our
            budget.

                         PLATO
            Don't give it a thought.  Only
            three million dollars a month!

                         JUDY
            Oh, we can manage that!  I'll
            scrimp and save and work my fingers
            to the bone...

                         JIM
            Why don't we just rent it for the
            season?

                         JUDY
            You see, we've just--oh, you tell
            him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I
            could die!

                         JIM
            Well--we're newlyweds.

                         JUDY
            There's just one thing.  What about--

                         PLATO
            Children?  Well, we really don't
            encourage them.  They're so noisy
            and troublesome, don't you agree?

                         JUDY
            Yes.  And so terribly annoying when
            they cry.  I just don't know what
            to do when they cry, do you dear?

                         JIM
            Of course.  Drown them like puppies.

                         JUDY
            See, we're very modern.

                         PLATO
            Shall I show you the nursery?  It's
            far away from the rest of the house.
            If you have children--Oh I hate the
            word!--or if you decide to adopt
            one--they can carry on and you'll
            never even notice.  In fact, if you
            lock them in you never have to see
            them again, much less talk to them.

                         JUDY
            Talk to them!  Heavens!

                         JIM
            Nobody talks to children!  They
            just tell them one thing and mean
            another.

                         PLATO
            It's wonderful that you understand
            so well--and so young too!  You
            know the most wonderful feature
            about the nursery?

                         JIM
            What?

                         PLATO
            There's only one key.

                         JIM
            We'll take it!

                         PLATO
            Come on!

PLATO leads them away from us down the arcade, the candelabra
casting wild shadows on the walls.  They are laughing as
they disappear through the glass doors at the end and their
laughter echoes stonily.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Med. shot.  A street and an alley.  Night seen through the
windshield of a police car.  Its radio is on low.  Two
officers are in the front seat.  One of them drinks coffee
from a container.  Suddenly MOOSE's heap moves past on the
street ahead.  In it are MOOSE, GOON and CRUNCH.

Full shot.  The street as MOOSE's heap continues up the
empty street.  The police car slides out of the alley where
it has been concealed, and follows at a distance.  Its
headlights are off.

Close shot.  CRUNCH, GOON and MOOSE (Process).  They are in
the front seat of MOOSE's heap.

                         MOOSE
            What time is it?

                         CRUNCH
            Hang loose.  We got all night.

                         MOOSE
            That maid saw us.  She could
            identify us too.

                         CRUNCH
            You still want to go home, Moose?

                         MOOSE
            No.

                         CRUNCH
            Then shut your mouth before your
            guts run out!

                         GOON
            What guts?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Inside glass solarium.  A swimming pool lies at the center.
There is no water in it.  Framing the pool is a flagstone
walk with marble benches spotted here and there.  The great
glass room had once been planted thickly with tropical
foliage.

But now what palms and lianas remain are withered and dead
with lack of care.  At the edge of the pool, near the deep
end, a blanket has been spread and a candelabra burns upon
it.  In its mysterious light our three kids are revealed:
JIM, bouncing precariously at the end of the diving board;
JUDY on the blanket nearby; PLATO on the pool's bottom.  All
three are laughing hysterically when suddenly JIM starts to
lose his balance.

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            Quick!  Fill the pool!

JIM falls in.  PLATO rushes to him.

                         JIM
            Let's see how long we can stay under.

                         PLATO
            Man, you're schizoid!

                         JIM
                   (in another outburst
                   of laughing)
            I'm what?  What?

                         JUDY
            You can't talk underwater!

                         JIM
                   (gargling)
            I bet you hear everything I say!

                         PLATO
                   (gargling)
            Isn't he schizoid?

                         JIM
                   (gargling)
            Hey!  How 'bout that!

They laugh again.  JIM swings up the ladder and goes to JUDY.
PLATO follows.

                         PLATO
            Haven't you noticed your personality
            splitting?

                         JIM
            Not lately.

They all sit on the blanket.

                         JIM
            How do you know so much about this
            junk, Plato?

                         PLATO
            I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I
            only went twice though.  My mother
            said it cost too much, so she went
            to Hawaii instead.

JIM lies back with his head in JUDY's lap.  She strokes his
hair and smiles at him.  PLATO looks away.

                         JIM
            No.  Seriously.  What's your trouble?

PLATO hesitates a moment, then leans back, cuddling between
the two of them.

                         PLATO
            I don't know but whatever it is,
            it's gone now.  I mean I'm happy
            now.  Here.

JIM puts his arm under PLATO's chin.

                         PLATO
            I came here before.

                         JIM
            When was that?

                         PLATO
            When I was here?  When I ran away.
            I used to run away a lot but they
            always took me back.

                         JIM
            Who?

                         PLATO
            Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my
            crib and I'd listen to them fight.

                         JIM
            You remember that far back?  Boy, I
            can't even remember yesterday.

                         JUDY
            Plato, where's your father now?

                         PLATO
            He's dead.  He was a hero in the
            China Sea.
                         JIM
            You told me he's a big wheel in New
            York!

                         PLATO
            I did?  Well, he might as well be
            dead.  What's the difference?

                         JUDY
            It's all right.

                         JIM
            Sure.

PLATO closes his eyes.  JUDY hums a lullaby as she strokes
JIM's lips with a finger.  He snaps at it.  Then he kisses
her hand, looks at her palm.  They whisper.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            You have a long life-line.

She takes his palm and examines it.

                         JUDY
            So have you.

She kisses it, holds her cheek against it.

                         JIM
            Ever been in a place like this before?

                         JUDY
            Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.

                         JIM
            How many rooms do you think there are?

                         JUDY
            I don't know.

                         JIM
            Should we explore?

She looks at PLATO.  JIM shrugs--tests to see if the boy is
awake, but there is no reaction.

Carefully, they crawl to their feet.  JIM supporting PLATO's
head with his hands as they do so.  JIM takes the other
blanket and covers PLATO with it.  JUDY kneels on the other
side and tucks it in.  They look at each other across him
and smile.  Then suddenly JUDY bends down and kisses PLATO's
cheek very softly.  JUDY and JIM rise.
JIM takes a candle from the candelabra and leads JUDY along
the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond.  Silence
except for their footfalls on the flagstone.  In the
distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through.
When they close again, a sob comes from PLATO.

High angle closeup.  PLATO lying as they left him, but his
eyes are open and he is crying.  Camera booms up as PLATO
throws off the blanket and looks after them.  Camera booms
higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure
sitting by himself.  The pool echoes his weeping.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Inside library.  Mansion.  Night.  The door opens slowly and
JIM appears with the candle.  JUDY lingers at the door.  The
flickering light reveals a formerly lavish room, paneled in
oak.  There is a tapestry couch, empty bookcases, some dim
portraits, a leather table and several chairs around a great
stone fireplace.

                         JIM
            Hey!  Will you look at this room!
                   (looks behind him)
            Judy?

She comes forward.  JIM drips wax on the table-top and
sticks the candle on it.  His hand shakes.  JUDY sits on the
couch.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Want to read any books?  Take your
            pick!
                   (sits beside her)
            Isn't this the craziest?

                         JUDY
            Hi.

                         JIM
            Hi.

He takes her hand.  She looks at him and smiles.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            What?

                         JUDY
            Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.
                   (kisses it)
            You're so funny.

                         JIM
            Why?

                         JUDY
            I don't know--you just are.
            Leaving a light for Plato.  That
            was nice.

                         JIM
            Maybe he's scared of the dark.

                         JUDY
            Are you?

JIM snuffs out the candle.  They are left in moonlight.  A
pause.

                         JIM
                   (singing)
            Here we are--
            out of cigarettes--
            Junior's in the nurs'ry--
            See how late it gets--

                         JUDY
            You don't need to do that.

                         JIM
            There's something I should tell
            you, Judy.

                         JUDY
            I know already.  We don't have to
            pretend now.

                         JIM
                   (laughing)
            What a relief!

He leans back, relaxed at last.  She snuggles close to him.

                         JUDY
            Is this what it's like to love
            somebody?

                         JIM
            You disappointed?

                         JUDY
                   (mussing her hair)
            Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and
            you--this is silly.

                         JIM
            What?

                         JUDY
            You smell like baby powder.

                         JIM
            So do you.

                         JUDY
            I never felt so clean before.

                         JIM
            It's not going to be lonely, Judy.
            Not for you and not for me.

                         JUDY
            I love somebody.  All the time I've
            been looking for someone to love me
            and now--I love somebody.  And it's
            so easy.  Why is it easy now?

                         JIM
            It is for me too.

                         JUDY
            I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.

She kisses his lips gently and looks into his face.  He
returns the kiss.  Their arms go around each other.

                         JIM
            I mean it too.

He kisses her again--

Full shot.  Road near Planetarium.  MOOSE's heap crawls up
and turns left.  A moment later, the police car appears and
does likewise--still holding its distance.

Full shot.  The mansion as MOOSE's heap moves past on the
road below.  Suddenly it stops.

Inside MOOSE's heap.  CRUNCH looks off, curious.

                         GOON
            What you stopping for?

                         CRUNCH
            You scam a car up there?

                         MOTHER
            So what?

                         CRUNCH
            Nobody's lived in that hunk of junk
            for five-six years.

He switches on the spotlight.  It illuminates JIM's heap.

                         CRUNCH
            Well, what do you know!  I feel a
            kick coming on!

He turns off all the lights and gets out.  The others follow.

Med. shot.  Police car.  It has halted.  One of the officers
gets out and draws his gun.  The other makes radio contact
in a low voice:

                         OFFICER
            This is Unit 17.  Unit 17.

                         RADIO
            Come in, Unit 17.

                         OFFICER
            We just zeroed three kids in a heap.
            Crest Drive and Observatory.  Looks
            like house-breaking.  Send us some
            help.  They may be armed.  Over.

Close shot.  PLATO asleep on the blanket.  Only a single
candle burns in the candelabra.  The same low whistles heard
earlier come from all around him and rise in volume.
Suddenly his eyes open.  He doesn't move, but he has come
suddenly awake.

Low shot.  PLATO lying in f.g.  Next to his face are a pair
of booted feet.  He looks up.  Camera pans up to show CRUNCH.
He is smiling.  He holds a tire chain in his hand which he
swings.

                         CRUNCH
            Good morning.

Full shot.  The swimming pool.  GOON and MOOSE are behind
CRUNCH.  They too are armed with tire chains.  They all
laugh.  PLATO rolls away from them and runs toward the deep
end of the pool.

                         CRUNCH
            Moose!  Take the steps!  Goon!  The
            other side.

The boys run to their assigned places.  PLATO sees no exit.
He flings himself down the ladder and into the pool.  He
feints this way and that, the boys responding as if they
were fencing.  CRUNCH swings down the ladder and his boots
make a loud report as they hit the pool.  MOOSE advances
down the steps at the shallow end.  GOON climbs onto the
pool bottom at the opposite side.  The feinting continues,
wordlessly, as the circle closes around PLATO.  The only
sounds are the stamping of their boots as they try to
distract him from side to side, and the animalistic grunts
they make to scare him.  Suddenly PLATO sees an opening and
plunges past MOOSE, pushing him over, and stumbles up the
steps.

                         CRUNCH
            Come on!  Let's make it!

They stream out of the pool after PLATO.  He reaches the
glass doors first, streaks though, and bangs them shut
behind him.

Traveling shot.  Arcade.  PLATO's face is visible only when
the moonlight strikes him through the passing windows.  The
sound of running steps behind him.

Full shot.  Main room.  A pattern of moonlight on the bare
floor as PLATO dashes in and through it.  He falls over a
piece of furniture and comes scurrying in to camera, wheels
around on hands and knees to face the door.  The boys plunge
into the moonlit square and stop.  PLATO tries not to
breathe.  A match is struck.  CRUNCH looks around, but can
see nothing.  That match goes out.  The boys start up the
stairs, whispering.  Immediately, PLATO crawls forward,
under the piano.  He hears a murmur of voices from behind
the oak door of the library--next to the piano.  He moves to
it stealthily.

Close shot, PLATO at door listening through it, on hands and
knees.  His confusion mounts.  He shakes his head to clear
it.  Then, suddenly he rises and tries the knob.  The door
is locked.  He beats on it.

                         PLATO
            Save me!

The boys run across the room.  As they hit the moonlit
square.  PLATO spins and fires.  Somebody drops and starts
moaning.  JIM opens the door.

                         PLATO
                   (shrieks)
            What you run out on me for!  What
            you leave me alone for?

                         JIM
            Plato!

There is a rush of boys coming forward.

                         PLATO
                   (with hate)
            I don't want you for my father!

                         JIM
            Your father!

PLATO fires at JIM.  JIM leaps at PLATO with a cry and
knocks him down.

                         JIM
                   (in rage)
            You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!

                         PLATO
                   (screaming)
            Get away from me!

He rolls away from JIM and runs to the main door.

                         JUDY
            Jim!

Main door, from inside.  PLATO falls upon it, fumbles with
the bolt and swings the door wide.  He steps out into the
waning moonlight and we see him running down the lawn.  JIM
rushes into the doorway and stops short.

Full shot.  Mansion.  The OFFICERS are moving away from us
toward it.  PLATO runs wildly toward them.

                         OFFICER
                   (sharply)
            Halt!

PLATO stops, confused.

                         OFFICER
                   (continuing)
            Come here.

JIM runs out on the promenade and starts over the balustrade.

                         JIM
            Plato!

Close shot.  PLATO.  His face is working desperately in
growing panic.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Come here, son.

                         PLATO
            No!

                         JIM (O.S.)
            Plato!

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Just walk over here quietly now--
            and there won't be any trouble.

PLATO runs out.

Close shot.  JIM as he screams.

                         JIM
            Plato!

Full shot.  Main doorway as JUDY rushes out, followed by
GOON and MOOSE.  They all stop dead at the balustrade.

                         JUDY
            Jim!  Watch out!

Reverse shot.  Lawn.  JIM seen in f.g.  PLATO bolting toward
the woods in the direction of the planetarium.  The officers
have both hit the ground in the distance.  They fire again.
JIM hesitates a moment, then rushes after PLATO.  The
officers fire again.

Moving shot.  JIM as he runs after PLATO.

Med. shot.  OFFICERS as they rise to their feet.

                         FIRST OFFICER
            Take the house!  I'll head him off.

Full shot.  Front of mansion.  JUDY flies down the stairs
and rushes past camera.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Halt!  Halt!

Prowl car.  Another part of town (Process).  RAY is driving.
JIM's father is beside him.  The mother is in the back seat.

                         RADIO
            --located at Summit Drive--the
            Planetarium.
                         RAY
                   (snapping on mike)
            The planetarium?  One kid inside--
            five housebreaking in area.  Will
            proceed.
                   (turning to JIM's parents)
            There are some kids in trouble--
            you'll have to go with me.

                         FATHER
            Perfectly all right.

Edge of woods as JIM hurtles in from the open ground beyond.
He stumbles against a tree and sinks down.

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            Plato!

Traveling shot in the woods as PLATO rushes through the
moonlit trees, sobbing.

                         JIM (O.S.)
                   (distant)
            Plato!

Med. shot.  JIM at the base of a tree.  He is whimpering,
shaking his head.  JUDY crashes through the brush and drops
beside him.

                         JUDY
            Did he hit you?

She is on the verge of hysteria.

                         JIM
            No!

                         JUDY
            We have to go back!

                         JIM
            No!  I got to find him.

He starts to rise.

                         JUDY
            After he tried to shoot you?

                         JIM
            He didn't mean it--we shouldn't
            have left him.  He needed us.

                         JUDY
            He needed you, maybe.  So do I.

There is a sound of distant gunfire.  Both kids freeze.

                         JIM
            He needs you too.  Come on.

JUDY, breaking into a run, follows after him through the brush.

                         JUDY
            You should have heard him talk
            about you tonight.  Like you were
            the hero in the China Seas.

                         JIM
            Sure.  He was trying to make us his
            family.

                         JUDY
            They're killing him!

JIM runs ahead blindly and disappears in the trees.  JUDY
rushes after him a few steps, then stops.

JUDY and JIM running.

PLATO running.

The planetarium.  Moonlight.  Shooting from the bridle path
and panning to the building.  PLATO reels in and goes to the
front door.

Med. shot.  Door to planetarium.  PLATO clutches the handle.
The door is locked.  He whimpers once in frustration.

Med. shot.  Policeman running up same path PLATO has followed.

PLATO at door to planetarium.  He smashes the glass with his
gun and dives through.

Inside planetarium as PLATO lands.  He is cut and bleeding.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Come out of there.

PLATO wheels and skitters backward across the floor of the
observatory on his hands and knees until he comes to the
door of the planetarium theater.

Reverse shot.  Main entrance.  Seen from inside.  The
OFFICER in b.g., PLATO in f.g.  The OFFICER appears in the
entrance, then moves quickly to one side to be less of a
target.  He reaches in to unlatch the door.

                         OFFICER
            You're making it tough on yourself,
            kid.  Come out quietly now.  You
            didn't kill anybody yet.

PLATO fires at him, then opens the door of the planetarium
theater and runs inside.  The door swings shut behind him.

Outside planetarium.  The OFFICER is hugging the outside
wall.  Another siren wails and a spotlight catches the
OFFICER who runs out into the light.

                         OFFICER
                   (running)
            Need a little help here!

Full shot.  Parking lot as the CHIEF's car wheels to a stop.
It is followed by a civilian car and a cab.

CHIEF's car.

                         CHIEF
            We heard firing.  He get anybody?
            You alone?

                         OFFICER
            We got a cookaboo inside.  He
            wounded some kid earlier.

                         CHIEF
            How'd he get in?

                         OFFICER
            Smashed the front door.

                         CHIEF
            Any other entrance?

                         OFFICER
                   (leaving)
            Down in back.

Med. shot.  Bushes bordering planetarium as JIM climbs
through them and stops short, staring in amazement.  JUDY is
in b.g.

Full shot.  Parking lot.  JIM seen in f.g. hiding in the
screen of leaves.  Beyond we see the full activity--the
crowd, the cars, searchlights playing on the planetarium
entrance, police moving in under direction of the CHIEF.

                         CHIEF
                   (loud on speaker)
            Silence.  Please maintain silence.
            Keep back and stay off the
            pavements.  Keep back and stay off
            the pavements.  There will be
            emergency vehicles coming through.
            This warning is for your own
            protection.

RAY's prowl car come in.  JIM's parents climb out, curious.
RAY hurries to consult with an officer who briefs him, then
hurries to the chief's car.

Parking lot.  Several patrol cars now line the parking lot.
The NEGRO WOMAN in her nightgown and overcoat pushes forward
from a cab and accosts an OFFICER.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            What's going on?

                         OFFICER
            I don't know, lady.  Some kid's in
            trouble.  Stand back, please.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            I got to know.  My boy run off
            tonight.  He had a gun with him, too.

Med. shot.  CHIEF's car as RAY hurries in.

                         CHIEF
            Hello, Ray--Know anything about this?

                         RAY
            As much as you do--Loan me your
            mike, will you?

                         CHIEF
                   (handing it to him)
            Help yourself.

                         RAY
                   (into mike)
            I am addressing the boy in the
            planetarium.  I am speaking to the
            boy inside.  This is Ray Framek
            from the Juvenile Division--

Close-up JIM as he reacts to RAY's name.  He rises and looks
off.

                         RAY (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            You are now surrounded.  You are
            surrounded by many armed police.
            Whoever you are, drop your weapon
            and come outside.

Med. shot.  JIM'S FATHER standing by RAY's car, gazing off
with interest.  His wife comes out and stands beside him,
looks at him questioningly.

                         RAY (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            Come outside.  Clasp your hands
            over your head and come outside
            quietly--

The FATHER's gaze has traveled over the scene.  Suddenly he
sees his son followed by JUDY, run into the planetarium.

                         MOTHER
            Frank!

                         FATHER
            Stay here.
                   (goes over to RAY)
            That was my son!

                         RAY
            You sure?

                         FATHER
            I think I know my son.

The FATHER moves behind the crowd, camera trucking with him,
until he reaches the bushes at the edge of the parking lot
and stops, gathering himself.  Meanwhile RAY's voice
continues over:

                         RAY (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            Jim Stark!  I'm addressing Jim
            Stark.  Nobody will harm you or
            your friends if you follow these
            instructions.  We are here to
            protect you.  Drop your guns and
            come outside.  Nobody will hurt you
            if you do as I say--

The FATHER starts forward along the bushes as if stalking
game.  Each step is carefully placed and quiet, but his
heart tugs him along like a kite dragging an anchor.

                         CHIEF
            Officers!  Another boy and girl
            just ran into the planetarium.  We
            do not know if they are armed.
            Hold your positions until further
            instruction.

Inside planetarium as JIM comes dashing in, spins around,
staring.  JUDY follows.  A siren is heard outside growing
shrill.

                         CHIEF (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            Ambulance.  Ambulance is coming
            through.  Clear a passage.  Will
            you people make way there?

Floodlights strike the door and illuminate the lobby dimly.

                         JIM
                   (softly)
            Plato?

Silence.  JIM moves cautiously to the door of the planetarium
theater.  JUDY hangs back.  Another siren is heard
approaching.  More floodlights strike the door.

                         JIM
                   (continuing - calling softly)
            Plato?  Plato, you in there?
                   (silence)
            Hey, I'm going to open the door now.
            You'll be able to see me and you
            can shoot me if you want, but just
            remember one thing, Plato--You're
            my friend.  That means a lot to me.

JIM opens the door slowly.

Inside theater.  Darkness except for the splash of light
from the door where JIM stands in silhouette.  He lets the
door close.  Blackness.

                         JIM
            Plato?

                         PLATO
            I'm here.

                         JIM
            Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a
            match?  I'm going to break my neck
            in here.  Where are you?

                         PLATO
            I've got a gun.

                         JIM
            I know.  Light a match, will you?

PLATO obeys.

                         JIM
            That's swell.  How are you?

                         PLATO
            I'm fine.

Another siren is heard outside.  JIM has reached the
lecturer's desk and, just as the match goes out, he throws a
switch.  The stars appear on the dome and the projector
starts its slow revolution.

                         PLATO
            You think the end of the world will
            come at nighttime, Jim?

                         JIM
            No.  At dawn.

                         PLATO
            Why?

                         JIM
            I just have a feeling.  Where are you?

                         PLATO
            Here.

                         JIM
            Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I
            can't talk to you if I don't see you.

JIM waits.  Nothing happens.

                         JIM
            Hey, look at the stars, Plato.
            Stand up and look at the stars.

Plato rises from behind a row, then JIM continues:

                         JIM
            That's fine.

JIM approaches slowly.

                         JIM
            I'm not going to hurt you.
                         PLATO
            Why did you run out on me?

                         JIM
            We didn't run out.  We were coming
            right back.

                         PLATO
            You sure?

                         JIM
            Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting.
            You ready to come out now?

A siren is heard.

                         PLATO
            No.

                         JIM
            I promise nothing'll happen if you
            do.
                   (silence)
            You want my jacket?  It's warm.

JIM takes off his jacket and holds it out to PLATO.

                         PLATO
            Can I keep it?

                         JIM
            What do you think?

JIM gives him the jacket--PLATO puts it on.

                         JIM
            You want to give me your gun now,
            Plato?

                         PLATO
            My gun?

                         JIM
            In your pocket.  Give it to me.

                         PLATO
            I need it.

                         JIM
            You trust me, don't you?  Just give
            it to me for a second.

PLATO hands him the gun.  JIM removes the cartridges and
puts them in his pocket.

                         PLATO
            You promised to give it back.

                         JIM
            Friends never break promises, do
            they?
                   (gives him back the gun)
            Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There
            are a lot of people outside and
            they all want you to be safe.  You
            understand that?  They said I could
            come in and bring you out.

                         PLATO
            Why?

                         JIM
            They like you.  Okay?

                         PLATO
            Come on!

JIM opens the door for PLATO, then follows him out.  JUDY
joins them.

                         JUDY
            Hi, Plato!

                         PLATO
            Hi.

Observatory as JIM, JUDY and PLATO come to the entrance.
PLATO sees an OFFICER.

                         PLATO
            Who's that?

                         JIM
            Just a guard.

                         PLATO
            I shot at one of them.

                         JIM
            But you didn't hurt anybody.

Outside observatory as PLATO and JIM come forward into the
early dawn.  PLATO stops and looks off, scared.

Slow pan shot.  The crowd.  It has grown enormously.
Silence.  There are armed officers everywhere--all waiting,
alert.

Med. shot.  NEGRO WOMAN.  Her eyes are moist.  Her lips move
in silent prayer.

Med. shot.  JIM's parents.  The FATHER looking on anxiously.
The MOTHER is crying against the car.

Med. shot.  JIM and PLATO.

                         PLATO
            Those aren't my friends.  Make them
            go away.

                         JIM
                   (tense; calling past camera)
            Ray!  Will you tell these guys to
            move back?

Suddenly PLATO bolts.  JIM wheels after him.

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            Plato!  Don't be a fool!

Full shot.  Planetarium as PLATO dashes to the stairway
leading to the balcony.

JIM'S FATHER and MOTHER.  Their faces reflect panic as they
see PLATO running in JIM's coat.

                         MOTHER
            It's Jim!

Full shot.  Balcony.  Shooting down the stairs as PLATO
rushes up.  JIM closes behind him.  Camera pans with PLATO
as he climbs the ladder to the ledge of the small dome.  JIM
stops at the foot of the ladder.

                         JIM
            Plato!

                         PLATO
            Keep away from me!  I don't believe
            you anymore!

He raises the gun as if to shoot JIM.  An OFFICER drops to
one knee and fires a shot at PLATO.

Full shot.  Small dome.  PLATO drops like a stone to JIM's
feet.

Close-up.  JIM.

                         JIM
                   (screaming--wildly)
            But I've got the bullets!  The gun
            was empty!

Close shot.  NEGRO WOMAN as she screams, a handkerchief in
her mouth.

Close shot.  JUDY.  She sobs once and runs up steps.

Med. shot.  JIM staring down at PLATO.

                         JIM
            Plato?
                   (crouches over PLATO)
            Plato.  Hey, Jerkpot!

There is nothing.  He rises and faces the crowd, shaking his
head in wonder and reproach.

                         JIM
                   (quiet)
            What did you have to do that for?

Full shot, the roof.  Parents and Officers.  The NEGRO WOMAN
is hysterical.  RAY shoves past her, followed by JIM'S
FATHER and MOTHER.  They rush toward camera.

Ambulance crew.  They spring into action, arrive with
stretcher.

The balcony.  JIM is at PLATO's side.  A couple of OFFICERS
rush forward to take JIM.  The FATHER comes in and pushes
them aside.

                         FATHER
            Let him alone!  He's mine!  I'll
            take care of him!

RAY, who has witnessed this, motions to the officers.

                         RAY
            It's all right!  It's all right!

The FATHER stares down at JIM for a moment.  Then he kneels
beside his son, puts his coat over JIM's shoulders.  He
speaks very gently.

                         FATHER
            For a minute...that jacket...I
            thought...
                   (breaks off, then)
            You couldn't help it, son.
                   (reaches out, gently,
                   but firmly)
            You did everything a man could do.

He takes JIM by the elbow and starts to bring him to his
feet.  The boy suddenly resists, and remains kneeling.

                         FATHER
            Stand up, Jim.  I'll stand up with
            you.  Let me try to be as strong as
            you want me to be.

A faint hope appears in the boy's face.  He no longer
resists as the FATHER helps him to rise.  But he still keeps
his back to him.  The ambulance attendants start putting
PLATO on a stretcher.  JIM moves, as if to stop them, but
the FATHER still holds his shoulders.

                         JIM
            He depended on me.

                         FATHER
            And you can depend on me, son.
            Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll
            face it together, I swear.

JIM feels, for the first time, the love and security he has
always wanted.  He clutches at his FATHER, crying unashamedly.
The FATHER's arms envelop him.  PLATO, through his death,
has helped these two find each other.

Close shot.  JUDY and RAY watching.

Low angle.  NEGRO WOMAN as she bends over PLATO's body.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (as they lift PLATO
                   onto litter)
            This poor baby got nobody.  Just
            nobody.

As he is carried past her, she follows.

Balcony stairs.  From below as JIM, supported by his FATHER,
comes down.  RAY is behind them.  They pause for a silent
meeting with the MOTHER at foot of the stairs.  She kisses
JIM and starts wiping his tears away, but he is weeping
soundlessly and it does no good.

JIM looks back up at the dome.  The ambulance attendants are
bearing PLATO's litter down the last few stairs, followed by
the NEGRO WOMAN.

Group.  The ambulance attendants come down the last few
stairs followed by the NEGRO WOMAN.  JIM steps forward
suddenly and adjusts the blanket covering PLATO.  JUDY comes
to JIM's side.  The litter passes camera and we hold on two
shot of JIM and JUDY, seen against the lightening sky.

                         JIM
                   (to JUDY, half to himself)
            He was always cold.

JUDY moves to JIM and touches his arm lightly.  He looks
down at her.

Med. shot.  The group.  JIM's arm is around JUDY as he leads
her, firmly, towards his MOTHER and FATHER.  His voice is
warm, brimming with the new found pride he takes in his
parents as he introduces JUDY to them.

                         JIM
            Mom--Dad--this is my friend.  Her
            name is Judy.

The parents nods warmly and smile at her.  She smiles shyly
in response, happy at being accepted.  There is a warmth
emanating from the tight little group.  Changes have
happened to them.  Old things have been shed and a new start
has been made.  Camera booms--pulls back high to:

High general shot.  Planetarium, JIM and JUDY, FATHER and
MOTHER threading their way through the crowd as the camera
continues to pull back.

                                            FADE OUT.

                          The end.
REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE

                     CAST OF CHARACTERS

                        JIM'S FAMILY

JIM'S GRANDMA: A chic, domineering woman in her sixties who
      has made her son Frank dependent upon her for every
      breath he takes.  She is the irritant in the
      household--the silent ruler--the silent enemy of
      Frank's marriage.

JIM'S FATHER: Frank is an unfeathered man who has never been
      able to have fun.  He is anxious to be a real father
      to Jim, but has never learned how.

JIM'S MOTHER: Tense and immature, she has never found the
      husband she married.  Upset by the presence of her
      mother-in-law, mated with an ineffectual and joyless
      man, she takes out her disappointment on him and on
      her son.

JIM: The angry victim and the result.  At seventeen he is
     filled with confusion about his role in life.  Because
     of his "nowhere" father, he does not know how to be a
     man.  Because of his wounding mother, he anticipates
     destruction in all women.  And yet he wants to find a
     girl who will be willing to receive his tenderness.

                        JUDY'S FAMILY

JUDY'S FATHER: a junior partner in a law firm.  Boyish,
       attractive and debonair.  Because he is frightened by
       the adolescence of his daughter, Judy, his only
       recourse is to criticize her.

JUDY'S MOTHER: Self-centered and frightened by the coming of
       middle-age.  She feels that Judy's blossoming youth
       is threatening her wifely position as the desirable
       object of the husband's attentions.

JUDY: The victim and the result.  At sixteen, she is in a
      panic of frustration regarding her father--needing his
      love and suffering when it is denied.  This forces her
      to invite the attention of other men in order to
      punish him.

BEAU: Judy's brother.  Because he is very young he is a
      danger to nobody and thus will grow up happily--
      certain of the love of his father who feels comfortable
      in giving it.

PLATO: Son of a divided family--an absent father and a
       traveling mother--he feels himself the target of
       desertion. At fifteen he wants to find a substitute
       family for himself so that he need no longer feel
       cold, and especially a friend who will supply the fatherly
       protection and warmth he needs and cannot find.

BUZZ: A sado-masochistic boy of seventeen, who acts out
      aggressively his idea of what a man should be in order
      to hide his real sensitivities and needs.  He was
      probably rejected by both parents and must constantly
      court danger and must constantly court danger in order
      to achieve any sense of prestige or personal worth.

                          THE KIDS

HELEN, CRUNCH, MOOSE, GOON, CHICK, COOKIE, MIL: All
       searching for recognition in the only way available
       to them; all suffering from unfulfilled hungers at
       home; all creating an outside world of chaos in order
       to bear the chaos they feel inside.  They are
       soldiers in search of an enemy.

FADE IN.

A deep night sky.  Matte shot.  Camera searches slowly
upward through the heavens and the silver tone of a bell is
heard sounding the strokes of midnight.

On the final note of the bell, camera is full on the Milky
Way and there it rests, just long enough for a burst of
Easter singing to arise.  The hymn is sung by the crude,
unmatched voices of children.  Camera pans down to include:

Spire of a church.  Camera continues its downward pan as the
singing continues and we pass a window beyond which is the
source of the singing.  Camera pans off window to show--

Long shot.  City.  Night.  Suddenly revealed--crisp and
sparkling with lights.  Camera pans down and over:

A lonely street full of parked cars.  The singing diminishes
but a thread of it remains.  A car has just parked.  The
headlights snap off.  A MAN emerges whistling the same
melody and pulls some gifts from the front seat.  He slams
the door and starts down the street in the direction of a
house with bright windows.  He must pass an empty lot full
of rusty grass and litter which lies in darkness between two
street lights.

As the MAN walks by the lot, still whistling, a GROUP OF
FIGURES rises silently from the grass, figures who have been
lying in concealment until now.  They step noiselessly onto
the pavement and follow the MAN.  At the sound of their
boots the whistling stops.

The MAN glances behind him and sees the figures walking
after him, filling the pavement.  A street light shows them
to be boys and girls and all quite young.  The MAN moves on
more swiftly and the sound of their pursuit increases.  He
begins to run toward the lighted house and the following
steps run too.  Suddenly he stops under the next street
light and turns to face the figures.  They are upon him and
around him quickly.  Nobody speaks for a moment, then one of
the boys grins.  His name is BUZZ.  He is big and filled
with an awareness of his own masculinity.

                         BUZZ
                   (friendly, cool)
            That was pretty what you were
            whistling.  Whistle some more.

The MAN whistles a nervous phrase, trying to make a joke of
the situation which he doesn't understand.

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing; suddenly)
            You got a cigarette?

                         MAN
            Oh, I think so--

The MAN fumbles in his pocket, finds a pack and drops it in
his nervousness.  The FIGURES wait until he picks it up.  He
offers one to BUZZ.

                         MAN
                   (continuing)
            Filter tips.

                         BUZZ
                   (smiling, encouraging)
            You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad.

Smiling uncertainly, the MAN puts the cigarette in his mouth.
BUZZ, still smiling, takes out a packet of wooden matches.

                         BUZZ
                   (continuing)
            I'll light it for you, Dad.

BUZZ ignites a match and holds it near the Man's face for a
second, searching it.  Then he ignites the whole box under
his nose.  The MAN shrieks, and his packages fall.  BUZZ
slaps him sharply, his smile gone.

The camera pans away as the figures enclose him, and holds
on a small mechanical monkey which has dropped from its
wrappings.  It begins to dance madly on the pavement, then
runs down.

The feet of the figures scatter past the unmoving monkey.
Then camera rises to show that the man has disappeared.
There is a moment of awful stillness, then we see a boy
coming down the street alone.  He is quite drunk, and he
slips once.  This is JIM, a good-looking kid of seventeen
with a crew-cut and wearing a good suit.  The spilled
packages on the pavement stop him.  He bends down to see
what they are and picks up the mechanical monkey from the
wreckage.  He smiles and winds it up.  He sets it on the
sidewalk and sits down.  He watches it dance for a moment,
happily.  A siren is heard distantly, growing louder.  JIM
pays no attention to it as he winds the monkey again and
releases it for its dance.

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE: "REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE" STARRING ____ as
siren rises piercingly close, and JIM looks up, we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Close shot.  Throbbing light of police car.  Night.  The
siren screaming wildly, then dying.  The sound of brakes.
Camera moves to reveal the police car stopped at the
entrance of a Precinct Station.  Two officers dismount,
bearing between them the struggling JIM.  They bear him up
the steps and in through the double doors.

Inside precinct station. Reception area.  A large open space
onto which several corridors converge.  In the middle is a
Sergeant's desk, really a quadrangular counter in the center
of which the SERGEANT stands.  There are a few glass-walked
interviewing rooms which open off the area, and several
benches lining the walls.  The scene is one of confusion,
activity and waiting.  Phones ring.  The arrested pass in
custody of officers.  Present among others at JIM's entrance
are: JUDY, who is blonde and sixteen.  She sits on a crowded
bench wearing an expression of downcast bitterness.  On a
bench across the way from her are three remarkably dirty
little Mexican children without shoes or socks.  The oldest
is a BOY of four who is protecting his little SISTER who in
turn mothers an infant crying on the bench beside her.
Standing at a corner of the desk is a docile, undersized boy
of fifteen named JOHN "PLATO" CRAWFORD.  He is shivering.
With him is a large NEGRO WOMAN, his maid.  JIM comes
through the doors and is led to the desk.  One of the
officers presents a brief report to the SERGEANT, who
examines it.

                         SERGEANT
            Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth
            Street?

                         OFFICER
            No.  Plain drunkenness.

                         SERGEANT
            This says he was picked up there.

                         OFFICER
            They had him on the carpet for an
            hour at Headquarters.  He's clear.
            Plain drunkenness.

                         SERGEANT
            Young squirt.  All right--You want
            to lean him against something?
            Stand him over there.

The officer leads JIM to JUDY's bench and stands him against
the wall beside it.

JIM is frisked, a look of prayer on his upturned face.  The
OFFICER finds the toy monkey in his pocket and would take
it, but when JIM asks to keep it, the OFFICER hands it back
and moves away.  Another officer enters and leads the
prisoner who is sitting next to JUDY into another room.  JIM
sits beside her.  He smiles at her but receives only a
chilling look.  He winds the monkey up and sets it dancing
on the floor, but she is not amused.  Camera pans to show
others reacting to the monkey with pleasure.  We see PLATO
look up and smile a little.  Camera stops on the MEXICAN
CHILDREN who are smiling too.  A bald JUVENILE OFFICER named
GENE, squats before them, smiling.

                         GENE
            You going to tell me your name now?

The little boy shakes his head.

                         LITTLE BOY
                   (touching GENE's bald pate)
            Where's your hair?

                         GENE
            It's all gone.

                         LITTLE BOY
            Did you get a haircut?

                         GENE
            No--it just fell out!

                         LITTLE BOY
                   (sympathetically)
            Aw--

GENE laughs as another Juvenile Officer enters and pauses to
look at the children.  His name is RAY.

                         RAY
            What gang does he belong to?

                         GENE
            Give him a couple of years.

                         RAY
            Where's your mamma, honey?

                         LITTLE BOY
            I don't know.

RAY and GENE exchange looks, then RAY moves across to JUDY--
camera following.  He looks down at her, consults the file
in his hand.

                         RAY
            Judy--we're ready for you now.

                         JUDY
                   (a mumble)
            He hates me.

                         RAY
            What?

                         JUDY
            He hates me.

She rises.  RAY leads her to one of the glass-walled offices.
Camera moves with them.  JIM watches them go.

                         RAY
            What makes you think he hates you,
            Judy?

                         JUDY
            I don't think.  I know.  He looks
            at me like I'm the ugliest thing in
            the world.  He doesn't like my
            friends--he--

RAY leads her into the office.

Inside small office as JUDY comes in, RAY following.  He
indicates a chair for her while he sits down behind a desk.

                         JUDY
                   (continuing)
            He doesn't like anything about me--
            he calls me--he calls me--

She starts to cry.  She doesn't hide it, but keeps wiping
the tears with the palms of her hands.
                         RAY
            He makes you feel pretty unhappy?

                         JUDY
                   (crying)
            He calls me a dirty tramp--my own
            father!

                         RAY
            Do you think your father means that?

                         JUDY
            Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe
            he doesn't mean it but he acts like
            he does.  We're altogether and
            we're going to celebrate Easter and
            catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So
            I put on my new dress and I came
            out and he--

                         RAY
            That one?

                         JUDY
            Yes--he started yelling for a
            handkerchief--screaming.  He
            grabbed my face and he rubbed all
            my lipstick off--he rubbed till I
            thought I wouldn't have any lips
            left.  And all the time yelling at
            me--that thing--the thing I told
            you he called me.  Then I ran out
            of the house.

                         RAY
            Is that why you were wandering
            around at one o'clock in the morning?

                         JUDY
            I was just talking a walk.  I tried
            to call the kids but everybody was
            out and I couldn't find them.  I
            hate my life.  I just hate it.

                         RAY
            You weren't looking for company,
            were you?

                         JUDY
            No.

                         RAY
            Did you stop to talk to anyone,
            Judy?
                   (she is silent)
            Do you enjoy that?

                         JUDY
            No.  I don't even know why I do it.

                         RAY
            Do you think you can get back at
            your Dad that way?  I mean
            sometimes if we can't get as close
            to somebody as we'd like we have to
            try making them jealous--so they'll
            have to pay attention.  Did you
            ever think of that?

                         JUDY
            I'll never get close to anybody.

                         RAY
            Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth
            Street, Judy.

                         JUDY
            You know where they picked me up!
            Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near
            there!

                         RAY
            Would you like to go home if we can
            arrange it?
                   (no answer; to WOMAN OFFICER)
            Did you notify the parents?

                         WOMAN OFFICER
            She wouldn't give me their number.

                         RAY
            What's your number, Judy?  We'll
            see if your Dad will come and get you.

JUDY looks up hopefully.

                         RAY
            Unless you really don't want to go
            home.
                   (silence)
            Would you rather stay here?

Camera moves close on JUDY.  She looks up and speaks very
quietly.

                         JUDY
            Lexington 05549.

The wail of a siren is heard.  JUDY looks off through the
glass wall toward JIM.  RAY is heard dialing.

Med. shot.  JIM's bench.  JIM sits with his head back, eyes
closed.  As the siren mounts louder, JIM opens his mouth and
imitates it--a long, forlorn wail.

Med. shot, PLATO and NEGRO WOMAN.  PLATO smiles faintly and
moves out toward JIM, NEGRO WOMAN following.  Camera pans
with them.  PLATO sits by JIM.  She stands over them.  JIM's
wailing continues.

Med. shot.  JIM, PLATO, NEGRO WOMAN.  An OFFICER moves into
shot.

                         OFFICER
            Hey!

JIM continues for a moment.

                         OFFICER
                   (continuing)
            Hey!  That's enough static out of you.

                         JIM
            Want me to imitate a stupid cop?

                         OFFICER
            Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.

                         JIM
            Yes, ma'am.

The OFFICER moves out.  The NEGRO WOMAN bends over PLATO who
is shivering violently.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            You shivering, John?  You cold?

PLATO shakes his head.  JIM notices him.

                         JIM
            Want my jacket?

PLATO looks up at JIM.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            You want my jacket?  It's warm.

PLATO wants it but shakes his head "no."

Full shot.  JUDY's office.  RAY and JUDY seated as before.
JUDY is still gazing through the glass.

                         RAY
            Your mother will be down in a few
            minutes, Judy--

                         JUDY
                   (clearing)
            What?

                         RAY
            Your mother will be down in a few
            minutes.

                         JUDY
                   (startled)
            My mother?

RAY signals to a WOMAN OFFICER just outside and leads JUDY
to the door.

Outside door as RAY turns JUDY over to the WOMAN OFFICER.

                         RAY
            She's being called for.

                         JUDY
            You said you'd call my father.

                         RAY
            Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.

JUDY doesn't answer.  RAY goes back inside as camera leads
the WOMAN OFFICER and JUDY past JIM's bench.  Camera stops
on JIM, PLATO and the NEGRO WOMAN.  JIM stares at JUDY and
whistles but gets no reaction.  GENE enters and comes to the
NEGRO WOMAN.

                         GENE
            John Crawford?

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Yes, sir.

                         GENE
            Come with me, John.

PLATO rises and goes with GENE, the NEGRO WOMAN following.
JIM is alone.  He closes his eyes, throws his head back and
gives another siren wail as camera moves close on his face.

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
            Jim!

JIM looks up suddenly, scared.  Then he smiles mysteriously
and staggers to his feet.

Low angle.  Tight three.  JIM's parents and grandma framed
in the doorway, frozen.  They are all dressed in evening
clothes.  The MOTHER is a very chic but rather hard-faced
woman.  The FATHER is an unfeathered man.  The GRANDMA is
the smallest, also very chic and very bright-eyed.

Med. shot.  JIM as he faces them.

                         JIM
            Happy Easter.

Tight shot.  The family.

                         MOTHER
            Where were you tonight?  They
            called us at the club and I got the
            fright of my life!

Silence.

                         FATHER
            Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

Close shot.  JIM.  He says nothing.

Close shot.  FATHER laughing uncomfortably.

Med. shot.  JIM.

                         JIM
            You think I'm funny?

JIM turns suddenly and walks to the glass wall of the office
behind which PLATO, the NEGRO WOMAN and GENE are visible.
He looks through the glass partition which separates him
from PLATO.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Why didn't you take my jacket?

Inside office.  JIM is seen through the glass.  He moves
away.  PLATO is still shivering, cracking his knuckles.

                         GENE
            Do you know why you shot those
            puppies, John?
                   (silence)
            Is that what they call you or do
            you have a nickname?

                         PLATO
                   (a murmur)
            Plato.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            You talk to the man nice now, hear?
            He's going to help you.

                         PLATO
            Nobody can help me.

                         GENE
            Can you tell me why you killed the
            puppies, Plato?

                         PLATO
            No, sir.  I just went next door to
            look at them like I always do.
            They were nursing on their mother
            and I did it.  I guess I'm just no
            good?

                         GENE
            What do you think's going to
            happen, you do things like that?

                         PLATO
            I don't know.  End up in the
            electric chair?

                         GENE
            Where did you get the gun?

                         PLATO
            In my mother's drawer.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            She keep it to protect herself, sir.
            She scared without a man in the house.

                         GENE
            Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

                         PLATO
            She's away.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Seems like she's always going
            somewhere.  She got a sister in
            Chicago and she go for the holiday.
            She says her sister is all the
            family she has.
                         GENE
            Where's your father?

PLATO is silent.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            They not together, sir.  We don't
            see him in a long time now.

                         GENE
            Do you hear from him, son?

PLATO looks up as JIM and his family move into the next
office.  JIM smiles at PLATO, who returns it feebly, then
looks away--embarrassed.

                         GENE
            You know if the boy ever talked to
            a psychiatrist?

                         PLATO
                   (smiling a bit)
            Head-shrinker?

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (laughing)
            Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in
            them!

                         GENE
            Well maybe she better start.

Other office.  JIM, his parents, GRANDMA and RAY are
gathered in the small room.  JIM is humming THE RIDE OF THE
VALKRYIES to himself as if he had absolutely no interest in
what is happening around him.  RAY suspects this is
something more than mere disinterest, so lets the humming go
on, in order to discover its real purpose.  GRANDMA watches
everything like a tennis match, reacting with soft little
sounds of terror or astonishment or sympathy.  No one pays
any attention to her.  For a moment no one talks.  RAY
watches JIM as he hums.  Then the FATHER shakes his head and
looks up.

                         FATHER
            I don't see what's so bad about
            taking a little drink.

                         RAY
            You don't?

                         FATHER
            No.  I definitely don't.  I did the
            sa--

                         RAY
            He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it
            looks to me like he had more than a
            little drink.

                         FATHER
                   (chuckling)
            Say, listen--

                         MOTHER
                   (to JIM: in intimate,
                   half-humorous disapproval)
            Jim--don't hum.

JIM merely rolls his eyes at her, then away--but continues
his humming.

                         FATHER
            I guess I cut pretty loose in my
            day too.

                         MOTHER
            Really, Frank?  When was that?

                         FATHER
            Listen--can't you wait till we get
            home?

                         RAY
            Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a
            little upset but--

                         FATHER
            Sorry.

                         RAY
            What about you, Jim?  Got anything
            to say for yourself?

JIM stops humming and shrugs.

                         RAY
            Not interested, huh?

JIM shakes his head.

                         MOTHER
            Can't you answer?  What's the
            matter with you anyhow?

                         FATHER
            He's just loaded, honey.

                         MOTHER
            I was talking to Jim.

                         FATHER
                   (to RAY)
            Let me just explain to you--we just
            moved here, y'understand?  The kid
            has no friends yet and--

                         JIM
            Tell him why we moved here.

                         FATHER
            Hold it, Jim.

                         JIM
            You can't protect me.

                         FATHER
                   (to JIM)
            You mind if I try?  You have to
            slam the door in my face?
                   (to RAY)
            I try to get to him--what happens?
                   (to JIM)
            Don't I give you everything you
            want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle.
            A car--

                         JIM
            You buy me many things.  Thank you.

                         FATHER
            Not just buy!  You hear all this
            talk about not lovely your kids
            enough.  We give you love and
            affection, don't we?

Silence; JIM is fighting his emotion but his eyes grow wet.

                         FATHER
            Then what is it?  I can't even
            touch you anymore but you pull away.
            I want to understand you.  Why'd
            you get drunk?  You must have had a
            reason.

JIM stares straight ahead, trying not to listen.

                         FATHER
            Was it because we went to that
            party?
                   (silence)
            You know what kind of drunken
            brawls those parties turn into--
            it's no place for kids.

                         MOTHER
            A minute ago you said you didn't
            care if he drinks.

                         GRANDMA
            He said a little drink.

                         JIM
                   (exploding)
            You're tearing me apart!

                         MOTHER
            What?

                         JIM
            Stop tearing me apart!  You say one
            thing and he says another and then
            everybody changes back--

                         MOTHER
            That's a fine way to behave!

                         GRANDMA
                   (smiling)
            Well you know who he takes after!

                         RAY
            Outside, Jim.  Come outside.

RAY pushes him out the door firmly, and into office vacated
by PLATO and GENE.

                         RAY
            Excuse us a minute?

                         FATHER
                   (very overwrought)
            Sure.  Sure.

GENE's office.  RAY and JIM alone.

                         JIM
            Someone should put poison in her
            epsom salts.

                         RAY
            Grandma?

No answer.  JIM turns away from RAY.

                         JIM
            Get lost.

                         RAY
            Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.

                         JIM
            Wash up and go home.

                         RAY
            Big tough character.  You don't kid
            me, pal.  How come you're not
            wearing your boots?

Suddenly JIM flings himself at RAY who deftly flips him past
and drops him near the desk.

                         RAY
                   (continuing)
            Too bad you didn't connect.  You
            could have gone to Juvenile Hall.
            That's what you want, isn't it?

                         JIM
            No.

                         RAY
            Sure it is.  You want to bug us
            till we have to lock you up.  Why?

                         JIM
            Leave me alone.

                         RAY
            No.

                         JIM
            I don't know why--!

                         RAY
            Go on--don't give me that.  Someone
            giving you hard looks?

                         JIM
            I just get so--
                   (fighting tears)
            Boy, sometimes the temperature goes
            way up.
                         RAY
                   (suddenly gentle)
            Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.

JIM starts crying.

                         RAY
            You feel like you want to blow your
            wheels right now?

                         JIM
            All the time!  I don't know what
            gets into me--but I keep looking
            for trouble and I always--I swear
            you better lock me up.  I'm going
            to smash somebody--I know it.

                         RAY
            Try the desk.

JIM smashes his fist against it, letting loose for a moment.
RAY watches, then sits near him.

                         RAY
            That why you moved from the last
            town? 'Cause you were in trouble?
            You can talk about it if you want
            to--I know about it anyway.
            Routine check.

                         JIM
            And they think they are protecting
            my by moving.

                         RAY
            You were getting a good start in
            the wrong direction back there.
            Why did you do it?

                         JIM
            Mess that kid up?

RAY just nods.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            He called me chicken.

                         RAY
            And your folks didn't understand?

                         JIM
            They never do.

                         RAY
            So then you moved?

                         JIM
            They think I'll make friends if we
            move.  Just move and everything'll
            be roses and sunshine.

                         RAY
            But you don't think that's a solution.

JIM is silent; he picks at his nails.

                         RAY
                   (continuing)
            Things pretty tough for you at home?

                         JIM
            She eats him alive and he takes it.

JIM stares at his family through hole in door.

                         JIM
            What a zoo!

                         RAY
            What?

                         JIM
            A zoo.  He always wants to be my
            pal, you know?  But how can I give
            him anything when he's--I mean I
            love him and I don't want to hurt
            him--but I don't know what to do
            anymore except maybe die.

                         RAY
            Pretty mixed up?

                         JIM
            If he could--

                         RAY
            "If he could" what?  You mean your
            father?

                         JIM
            I mean if he had the guts to knock
            Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy
            and I bet she'd stop picking.  They
            make mush out of him.  Just mush.
            One thing I know is I never want to
            be like him.

                         RAY
                   (interrupts)
            Chicken?

                         JIM
            I bet you see right through me,
            don't you?

RAY shrugs.

                         JIM
            How can anyone grow up in this circus?

                         RAY
            You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want
            some water?

                         JIM
                   (as RAY gets a cup of
                   water from cooler)
            Boy--if I had one day when I didn't
            have to be all confused and ashamed
            of everything--or I felt I belonged
            some place.

                         RAY
                   (giving him water)
            Here.  Look, will you do something
            for me?  If the pot starts boiling
            again, will you come and see me
            before you get yourself in a jam?
            Even if you just want to talk--come
            in and shoot the breeze.  It's
            easier sometimes than talking to
            your folks.

                         JIM
            Okay--

                         RAY
            Any time--day or night.  You calmed
            down enough to go back now?

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            You serious?

RAY smiles and opens the door.

RAY's office as JIM comes towards his MOTHER and forces
himself to kiss her.

                         JIM
            I'm sorry.

                         MOTHER
            All right, darling.

She rises and takes his arm.  They start out through the
door into the hall, followed by GRANDMA and FATHER.

                         GRANDMA
                   (to RAY)
            This was all very unfortunate, but
            he made a mistake and he's sorry--
            so we're not going to have any more
            trouble.  He's always been a lovely
            boy--

                         JIM
            Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell
            another lie you're going to turn to
            stone.

                         RAY
            Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.

                         FATHER
                   (offering RAY three cigars)
            Have some cigars.

                         RAY
            No thanks, I don't smoke.

                         FATHER
            Go on--Give 'em to your friends.

                         RAY
            No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.

                         MOTHER
            Frank--he doesn't want any.

JIM grins at RAY who nods.  They all leave.  RAY looking
after them, shakes his head and lights a cigarette.  We see
JIM and his family pass through the main door.  Waiting to
enter, in the custody of some uniformed police, are BUZZ and
the kids we saw at the opening, sullen and truculent.  As
they march into the lobby and JIM grows smaller in the
distance, the music comes up and out.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

Low angle.  Alley.  Morning.  A rabbit comes running down
the alley followed by a group of young kids, screaming with
pleasure.

As camera pans with the group, the littlest, a boy of five,
stops near us looking after the disappearing group.  The
shouts of the children wane.

JUDY rushes out from a backyard beyond him.  She is carrying
school books and a bag lunch.  She wears a polo coat against
the winter wind.

                         JUDY
                   (yelling)
            Beau!

The boy, who is her brother, BEAU, looks up but doesn't move.
JUDY stops at her gate.  A car careens down the alley, past
him.

Long shot.  JUDY and BEAU seen through a window in JIM's
house.  JIM is in f.g. looking out through the curtains.  He
smiles.

                         JUDY
                   (yelling)
            What are you trying to do, get
            yourself killed?

                         BEAU
                   (laughing)
            Yes!

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
            Your eggs are on the table, dear.

JIM turns from window and passes camera.

Full shot JIM's dining room.  The MOTHER is just settling a
plate of eggs at JIM's place.  They FATHER is seated,
drinking coffee and looking at the newspaper.  GRANDMA comes
in from kitchen.  JIM is neatly dressed in tie, tweed jacket
and slacks.

                         MOTHER
                   (continuing)
            Sit down and eat--you'll be late.

                         JIM
                   (approaching table)
            It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm
            nervous or something--

                         GRANDMA
            It's a wonder we don't all have TB
            or some other terrible disease
            after living in all those smokey
            cities!

                         MOTHER
            Well, drink your milk anyhow.

                         GRANDMA
                   (muttering)
            There aren't so many factories here.

                         FATHER
            Mother--

                         JIM
                   (still standing; he drinks)
            You make any sandwiches?

                         FATHER
            My first day of school, mother'd
            make me eat and by golly I could
            never even swallow till recess--

                         MOTHER
                   (bringing bag of
                   lunch from buffet)
            There's nothing to be nervous about.
            Here's peanut butter and meat loaf--

JIM makes a mouth-stuck-together-with-peanut-butter sound.

                         GRANDMA
            What did I tell you?  Peanut butter!

                         MOTHER
            Well, there's a thermos of orange
            juice and some apple-sauce cake in
            the wax paper to wash it down.

                         GRANDMA
            I baked that!

                         JIM
                   (kisses her cheek)
            'Bye, Mom.

                         MOTHER
            Goodbye, dear.

                         FATHER
                   (rising)
            So long, young fella.  Knock 'em
            dead, like your old man used to!

                         JIM
            Sure--
                   (gets to door and turns)
            You know something?  I have a
            feeling we're going to stay here.

                         FATHER
            And listen--watch out about the
            pals you choose--Know what I mean?
            Don't let them choose you--

But JIM is on his way out.

Full shot.  JIM's backyard as JIM comes out of the kitchen
door into the early sunshine.

                         JUDY (O.S.)
            Come out of the alley, Beau!  This
            is the last time I'm going to call
            you.

JIM blinks, pauses and sees JUDY.  He takes off his tie and
puts it in his pocket.  Then he starts across the backyard,
camera panning with him to:

Full shot.  The Alley with JIM coming out his gate, JUDY and
BEAU visible beyond.  He stops again.

                         JUDY
            Beau!  All right--go to school alone!

She starts down the alley.  BEAU skips after her and starts
tightrope-walking the gutter gravel.

                         JIM
                   (calling)
            Hey!

JUDY glances at him briefly, but continues.  JIM follows a
few yards, but on his side of the alley.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Hey, didn't I see you before some
            place?

JUDY ignores him, but something self-conscious happens to
her walk.  JIM runs across the alley.

Med. shot.  JUDY stopping as JIM enters.  BEAU tight-rope
walking on down the hill.

                         JIM
            Hi.  I saw you before.

                         JUDY
            Bully for you.

                         JIM
            You don't have to be unfriendly.

                         JUDY
            Now that's true!

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            See?

                         JUDY
            "Life is crushing in on me."

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I
            know where it was.

                         JUDY
            Where what was.

                         JIM
            Where I saw you.
                   (no answer)
            Everything going okay now?
                   (no answer)
            You live around here?

                         JUDY
                   (relieved)
            Who lives?

                         JIM
            See, I'm new.

                         JUDY
            Won't mother be proud.

                         JIM
            You're really flipped--aren't you.

JUDY looks up a little surprised.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Where's Dawson High School?

                         JUDY
            You going there?

                         JIM
            Yeah--why--

                         JUDY
            Dig the square wardrobe!

                         JIM
                   (defensively)
            Yeah.  So where's the high school?

                         JUDY
                   (softer)
            University and 10th--Want to carry
            my books?

An auto horn, stuck, in the distance.

                         JIM
            I was just getting my car.  I could
            take you.

The horn approaches, loud.

                         JUDY
            The kids take me.

                         JIM
            Oh.

Another angle.  JIM and JUDY as the car, horn blowing,
wheels into view above them and comes careening into the
alley.  JUDY sees it and moves a step away from JIM.

                         JUDY
            I'll bet you're a real yo yo.

                         JIM
            A what?

                         JUDY
                   (yelling over horn)
            Goodbye!  See you!

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            I'm not so bad.

JUDY is moving toward the car.

Med. shot.  Car full of kids as it comes to a jolting stop
near JUDY.  The boys wear suede coats, leather jackets,
black peggers, boots.  Their clothing is not uniform--it is
the air they assume which is uniform: swaggering, self-
conscious, piratical.  Someone is always combing his hair.

The driver is BUZZ, whom we recognize as the leader of the
stomp gang we met on Easter.  He wears a leather jacket.
With him are CHICK, a slight bespectacled lad; CRUNCH,
BUZZ's first lieutenant; COOKIE, a hanger-on; GOON, a
character; and the girls HELEN and MILLIE.  The kids are
screaming as BUZZ jams on the brakes.  JUDY comes forward.
JIM hangs back.

                         BUZZ
            Stella-a-a-a!

JUDY comes to them quickly, smiling.

                         JUDY
            Steady Marlon!

                         BUZZ
            Wanna make the colored lights go
            around and around?

JUDY and BUZZ kiss ardently and without love.  JIM goes for
his car.

                         BUZZ
                   (looks after JIM then
                   at JUDY)
            What's that?

                         JUDY
            A new disease.

                         BUZZ
                   (a little suspicious)
            Friend of yours?

                         JUDY
            I'm glad they let you out.

                         BUZZ
            Nobody chickened.

                         JUDY
            I heard about it.  You're lucky he
            lived.

                         BUZZ
            They always live.

During this JIM has gotten his car and has driven up.

                         JIM
            Where's University and 10th?
                         JUDY
                   (pointing right)
            That way!

                         CHICK
                   (pointing left)
            That way!

                         BUZZ
                   (pointing up)
            That way!

Simultaneously, the kids laugh wildly.  The radio blares.
JUDy lays her head on BUZZ's shoulder and his arm goes
around her as the car zooms away.  JIM looks after them a
moment, then follows.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Close shot.  Bicycle rack.  Wheels spin in, one after
another and drive straight into their slots.  As the nearest
bike moves in:

Med. shot.  PLATO just getting off his motor scooter.  He
comes forward, passes camera which pans with him then
stops--as the school is suddenly revealed.  Music starts
with a crash and keeps mounting through the following.
PLATO sighs and moves away from us to join the parade of
students filling the Main approach.

Parking lot as cars scream into their places noisily.  JIM
gets out of one and comes forward.  A motorcycle roars by,
just missing him.  JIM stares off and starts to move as
camera pans with him to:

Another angle.  School.  Another crash of music.  JIM moves
toward the parade.

Full shot.  Mid-way down main approach.  A number of kids
pass, gossiping happily as they greet each other for the
first time since vacation.  Camera searches over them and
stops upon our special group moving toward us--BUZZ, JUDY
and the rest, all abreast.  Others must park at their
passage or be elbowed out of the way, staring resentfully,
but not daring to challenge the group's priority.  PLATO
runs forward, past them.

Door from within bouncing from hand to hand as students
enter.  PLATO moves through the door and disappears in a
milling of kids.  JUDY enters with her group and moves on
with them.

Med. shot.  Monitor (inside corridor).  The Monitor is an
athletic letter-sweater boy with an arm brassard that bears
the letters "HC".  Kids pour past him.  JIM enters.

                         JIM
            Hi--can you tell we where I go?
            I'm just starting here.

                         MONITOR
                   (pointing at brassard)
            Mr. Bassett's office--203.  He'll
            tell you where your home room is--

                         JIM
            Thanks a lot.

JIM moves out.

Angle shot.  Corridor.  Shooting past a row of steel lockers.
The clash and slam of doors as kids throw in coats, pull out
books and primp for the day ahead.  PLATO comes to his
locker, which is the nearest, and opens it.

Full shot.  Corridor.  JIM moves toward us from the distance.
Crowded at the entrance to a classroom in f.g. are JUDY and
her pals.  They are sneaking a smoke, passing the cigarette
from one cupped hand to another.  As JIM comes near, JUDY
sees him.  So do the others.  They fold their arms across
their chests and whistle "We are the girls of the
institute"--all but JUDY.  JIM glances at her and continues
on past camera.  A bell starts ringing crazily over the music.

Close shot.  PLATO.  He is straightening his tie in the
mirror.  Above it, pasted to the locker door, is a still of
Alan Ladd.  In the mirror we can see JIM moving past.  PLATO
sees him too.  He wheels around and stares.

                         PLATO
                   (to himself)
            Hi.

The strident music of the students diminishes.  The ringing
of the bell stops.  There remain only JIM's footsteps.

Long shot.  JIM moving off down the corridor.  PLATO is in
f.g. looking after him.  He slams his locker and starts
after JIM, moving at the same speed and hovering near the
wall.  The footsteps of the two boys echo stonily.  They are
alone.  JIM stops at a bulletin board near a bend in the
corridor.  PLATO stops too.

Bulletin board.  JIM looking at the notices.  PLATO drifts
in several yards away and hangs near the wall watching JIM
who doesn't see him.  JIM reads:

Insert: Bulletin board, "Attention All Juniors and Seniors"--
Planetarium field trip--2 pm--Sharp!"

Another angle.  JIM and PLATO as JIM turns from bulletin
board and starts away.

                         PLATO
                   (clearing his throat)
            Hi.

                         JIM
            Hi there.

                         PLATO
            You remember me?

                         JIM
            No.  I don't think so--

                         PLATO
            I'm sorry--I made a mistake.

JIM starts toward camera as PLATO after another look, turns
in the opposite direction and walks away from us, smashing
his fist against the wall as he goes.  JIM stops, full in
camera.  His face clouds, trying to remember.  He turns full
around to look after PLATO, then turns back and continues on
his way.  The footsteps fade.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Full shot.  Planetarium seen from the parking lot--a great
dome crowns it--the city lies below.  Camera picks up JIM's
car maneuvering through the crowded lot.  In b.g. a few
other late-comers are dashing up steps to Planetarium.  JIM
drives into a small lot behind observator, parks, then runs
to observatory entrance.

Full shot.  Lobby as JIM runs through, opens door of theater
and passes inside.

Long shot.  Sky full of stars seen past JIM's head.
Darkness.  This is not our sky.  It is a replica of it
projected onto the dome of the Planetarium.  The stars slide
their tentative ways in an ever-changing pattern.  One of
them is much larger than the rest and increases in size as
we watch.  Music of the spheres is heard--a high threatening
tremolo.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            For many days before the end of our
            earth people will look into the
            night sky and notice a star,
            increasingly bright and increasingly
            near.

JIM looks around for a seat and passes down aisle.  Seen
beyond him is the projector, moving slowly, its great dumb-
bell head sparkling with pin-points of light.  JIM takes a
seat in front row.  PLATO, in the row behind him, moves over
a seat to be nearer.  They exchange looks.

Full shot.  Normal students watching intently.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            As this star approaches us, the
            weather will change.  The great
            polar fields of the north and south
            will rot and divide, and the seas
            will turn warmer.

Low angle.  LECTURER.  A dry, elderly man in a stiff white
collar.  He is seated at a desk, the light from the reading
lamp spilling upward onto his face.

                         LECTURER
            The last of us search the heavens
            and stand amazed.  For the stars
            will still be there, moving through
            their ancient rhythms.

Angle shot.  Students.  Some watching, some taking notes.
An OLD LADY TEACHER in f.g. taps the heads of two kids in
the row before her.  They stop their whispering.  She smiles
at them.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            The familiar constellations that
            illuminate our night will seem as
            they have always seemed, eternal,
            unchanged and little moved by the
            shortness of time between our
            planet's birth and its demise.

Med. shot.  PLATO staring upward.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Orion, the Hunter.

PLATO looks off.

Med. shot.  JIM (from PLATO's angle).  JIM is seated in the
row ahead of PLATO.  His lips are parted as he looks up.

                         JIM
            Boy!

                         PLATO
                   (leaning forward)
            What?

                         JIM
                   (surprised)
            Once you been up there, you know
            you been some place!

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Gemini, the Twins.

Two shot.  JUDY and BUZZ.  BUZZ has his arm around her.  He
is nuzzling her ear.  She is blandly watching the dome.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
            Cancer, the Crab.

BUZZ pokes JUDY who looks at him.  He curves his wrist
toward her, opening and closing his first two fingers like
the pincers of a crab.

                         BUZZ
            I'm a crab!

She laughs.  So do the others.

Med. shot. JIM (PLATO behind).  Seen from JUDY's angle.  JIM
turns at the sound of the laughter, and smiles.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Taurus, the Bull.

                         JIM
                   (in good imitation)
            Moo!

He waits for approval.

Angle shot.  JUDY, BUZZ and group (seen from JIM's angle).
He is in f.g.  They are staring at him.  Nobody laughs.

                         CRUNCH
                   (flat)
            Yeah, moo.

                         BUZZ
            Moo.  That's real cute.  Moo.

                         GOON
            Hey, he's real rough--

                         CRUNCH
            I bet he fights with cows.

                         BUZZ
            Moo.

They turn from him.  JIM withers and looks front.  JUDY
smiles a little and looks away so the others cannot notice
her amusement.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Sagittarius and Aries--all as they
            have ever been.

PLATO leans in and touches JIM's shoulder, lightly at first,
then harder.  JIM turns to him.

                         PLATO
            You shouldn't monkey with him.

                         JIM
            What?

                         PLATO
            He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard
            to make friends with them.

                         JIM
            I don't want to make friends.

He turns back, unhappy at having revealed himself.

Another shot.  JUDY, BUZZ, CRUNCH.  JIM seen in b.g.  The
kids are whispering among themselves and pointing at JIM,
who looks up and notices.  He is getting uncomfortable.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            And while the flash of our
            beginning has not yet traveled the
            light years into distance--

Full shot.  The dome.  The star rushes nearer, looming
larger and larger.  The music rises in tension and volume.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Has not yet been seen by planets
            deep within the other galaxies, we
            will disappear into the blackness
            of the space from which we came.

Two shot.  JIM and PLATO staring upward, cringing back into
their seats as the light on their faces increases.  Music is
up loud.

Full shot.  The dome seen past PLATO's head.  The heavens
grow brighter as the star plummets near.  Music at crescendo.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Destroyed as we began in a burst of
            gas and fire.

The sky is blasted by a wild flash of light.  Music reaches
explosion.  The stars appear again.

Moving shot.  Faces of normal kids watching seriously--very
impressed.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
                   (continuing)
            The heavens are still and cold once
            more.  In all the complexity of our
            universe and the galaxies beyond,
            the Earth will not be missed.

Med. shot.  JIM and PLATO looking up.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            Through the infinite reaches of
            space, the problems of Man seem
            trivial and naive indeed.  And Man,
            existing alone, seems to be an
            episode of little consequences.

PLATO ducks his head down on the back of JIM's chair.  JIM
looks at him.

                         LECTURER (O.S.)
            That's all.  Thank you very much.

The lights go on.  The rustle and confusion of kids
stretching after sitting too long.  Scattered applause.  JIM
rises and ruffles PLATO's hair.

                         JIM
            Hey, it's over.  The world ended.

PLATO looks up at him.

                         PLATO
            What does he know about Man alone?

Med. shot.  LECTURER as he reaches over and turns a dial.
"Morning Song" by Grieg comes on softly.
Low angle.  OLD LADY TEACHER rising.  She stares around at
the bustling students and claps her hands sharply, but the
noise is barely heard above the tumult.

                         TEACHER
                   (shrill)
            May I have your attention?  May I
            please have your attention?
            Classes will meet at the busses
            outside.  May I have your attention?
                   (to herself)
            The heck with it.

She picks up her coat and bag.

Planetarium parking lot.  School busses and autos, some new
and some heaps, are parked in f.g.  Beyond is the dome of
the Planetarium.  Kids mill about, some already driving off
in their cars.  One bus, already full, pulls past camera.

Med. shot.  Front of bus seen from within.  Driver in f.g.
Kids swarm up the steps and enter.  PLATO is among them, but
keeps looking back for JIM.  PLATO boards the bus and pauses
near the driver to peer through windshield.  His face clouds.

Long shot.  JUDY and group.  Seen from PLATO's angle through
windshield.  They are standing idly in a loose line near
BUZZ's car.  They are looking back toward Planetarium.

Med. shot.  Front of bus, seen from within.  PLATO turns
suddenly and pushes his way past the kids who are boarding.

                         PLATO
            Excuse me.  Excuse me.

Full shot.  Parking lot.  Bus in f.g.  Beyond it JUDY and
the group are visible.  PLATO squeezes out.

                         MALE TEACHER
            John, where you going?

                         PLATO
            I forgot something.  I'll get a hitch.

PLATO moves quickly past the teacher who climbs in.  The
door slams, the bus moves away.  PLATO stops and looks after
it.  The last cars are clearing the lot.  Only JIM's and
BUZZ's remain.  PLATO looks at the small, waiting group.

Med. shot.  The group seen from the rear.  PLATO in the
distance facing them.

                         BUZZ
            What you looking at?

Med. shot.  PLATO wild-eyed with fear.

                         PLATO
            Nothing.

He runs off, camera panning with him.  His goal is the
Planetarium Entrance, visible beyond.  He races toward it
frantically.

Med. shot.  The group looking off after PLATO.  BUZZ,
nearest camera, pulls a switch-knife from his pocket and
pops the long blade open.  JUDY stares at it, then looks up
at BUZZ apprehensively.  CRUNCH sits down on the bumper and
lights a cigarette.

Display lobby.  Planetarium as PLATO rushes in, out of
breath, stops and looks around.  In distance he sees JIM
leaning over the pendulum pit, smoking quietly.  PLATO
doesn't move.  JIM hasn't even looked up.

                         PLATO
                   (screaming as if he
                   were yelling "fire!")
            What's your name!

                         JIM
            Jim.  What's yours?

                         PLATO
                   (a little quieter)
            Plato.  It's a nickname.

JIM nods.  PLATO goes over to him, camera following, until
they are close together, both leaning over the rail.

                         PLATO
            Listen, I told you not to fool with
            them.  Now they're waiting for you.

                         JIM
            I know.  That's why I came back.

                         PLATO
            You scared?

                         JIM
            I just don't want trouble.

                         PLATO
            He has a knife.

                         JIM
            I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing
            swing, will you?  Do you think it
            never stops?

                         PLATO
            No.  It's perpetual motion.

                         JIM
            Oh, I bet some little guy comes in
            here at night and pushes it.  Go-
            go-go!

PLATO walks cautiously to the door and starts outside,
camera following.

Long shot.  Kids (corner of Observatory) with PLATO leaning
out of door, seeing them, pulling back quickly.

Inside display lobby as PLATO pulls back through the door.
JIM seems to have disappeared.  PLATO stares around frightened.

                         PLATO
            Jim?

JIM is looking at another exhibit whose mechanical voice is
heard.

                         JIM
            I'm here.

                         PLATO
                   (coming with him)
            They're still there!

JIM nods.  They watch the exhibit a while longer.

                         PLATO
            Jim--Do you think when the end of
            the world comes it'll be at night?

                         JIM
            No.  In the morning.

PLATO looks up questioning.  JIM smiles and shrugs.

                         JIM
            I just have a feeling.

They start moving, camera leading.

                         PLATO
            If you don't want trouble, I know a
            place we can go--

JIM looks up at him.

                         PLATO
            It's a big mansion and we could
            sneak around there and they
            wouldn't even know.  You could be
            safe--

They turn a corner quickly.

Doors to balcony (from inside) as JIM and PLATO come to them
from behind camera, fling the doors open and step outside.

Balcony as JIM and PLATO come onto it, lean on the parapet.
PLATO points off.

                         PLATO
            There it is.

High long shot.  Mansion. (Matte).  It is falling into
elegant ruin, casting long afternoon shadows on the great
lawns and promenades.

Closeup PLATO looking urgently at JIM.

                         PLATO
            Should we go?

Two shot.  JIM and PLATO.  PLATO's back is to us.  JIM looks
past him and sees something.

                         JIM
                   (quietly)
            The shadows are getting long.

PLATO turns to look too.

Long high shot.  Parking lot.  JIM's car is where he left it.
Into the driveway, like logs driven before a sea, the
shadows of the waiting kids appear and advance until the
kids themselves come into view.  They pause there a moment,
then look up.

                         HELEN
                   (smiling)
            Le soleil tombe dans la mer.

Laughter.  The kids scatter along the wall at the foot of
the balcony stairs.  BUZZ goes to JIM's car, knife in hand,
and stands silently.

Low angle.  Two shot.  JIM and PLATO staring down from
balcony parapet.  At last JIM moves out past camera.

Low angle.  Long shot.  JIM and PLATO.  JUDY in f.g.  The
two boys walk down the stairs.  Camera pans with them as
they reach parking lot level and start walking past other
members of the group.

Traveling shot.  JIM and PLATO coming forward.

Dolly shot.  BUZZ from JIM's angle.  As camera moves in
toward BUZZ standing alone at the car, he suddenly bends
down and slashes JIM's tire.  Camera stops.  There is the
hiss of air escaping.  BUZZ straightens and smiles past camera.

Close shot.  JIM inhaling sharply in shock and suppressed
anger.

Full shot over JIM's car.  Group in b.g. motionless.  JIM
and PLATO approach the car.  JIM stops and looks down.  BUZZ
stands smiling and puts away the knife.

Close shot.  Rear wheel.  The tire slashed, the wheel rests
on the ground.

Full shot.  Car.  Shooting between group and BUZZ toward
backs of JIM and PLATO, who are looking down at car which
rests on its rims.  JIM turns and moves toward group.  He
stops, looks from one to the other and smiles nervously.
Then he looks straight at BUZZ.

                         JIM
                   (wearily)
            You know something?

                         BUZZ
            What?

                         JIM
                   (reproachfully)
            You watch too much television.

Med. shot.  The group and JIM.  JUDY has come to BUZZ,
stands on the wall above him.

                         BUZZ
            Hey, he's real abstract and different.

                         JIM
            I'm cute, too.

Suddenly GOON starts clucking softly like a chicken.  One by
one the others pick it up.  BUZZ, the last, crows.  Silence.

Med. shot.  The group and JIM.

                         JIM
            Meaning me?

                         BUZZ
            What?

                         JIM
            Chicken?

The group gives a quick, short laugh.

Med. shot.  JIM as he takes off his glasses, smiles.  Shakes
his head disapprovingly.

                         JIM
            You shouldn't call me that.

Close shot.  PLATO watching anxiously.

Med. shot.  BUZZ with JUDY watching above him.  JIM enters
shot until he is close to BUZZ's face.  He looks up at JUDY.
Camera closes in until we are tight on the three.  The heads
are nearly touching.

                         JIM
                   (softly to JUDY)
            You always at ringside?  You always
            travel in this rank company?

BUZZ clutches JIM's hair and jerks his head up.  He cracks
JIM smartly across the face with the palm of his hand.

Close shot.  JUDY looking at JIM.  Her eyes clear in
recognition.

Another angle.  The group and JIM as JIM tears free and
comes at BUZZ, slugging.  But BUZZ, with a laugh, leaps onto
the parapet and turns, the knife in his hand again.  JIM
stops short.  The group and PLATO move in around him.

                         JIM
            I thought only punks fought with
            knives.

                         BUZZ
            Who's fighting?  This is the test,
            man.  It's a crazy game.

                         HELEN
            Les jeux de courage!

Close-up.  CRUNCH.  He is smiling.  His arms are around the
shoulders of the kids who flank him.

                         CRUNCH
                   (wetting his lips)
            Machismo.  Machismo.

Med. shot.  Group.

                         JIM
            Machismo?

                         BUZZ
            Somebody find him a knife.

Close shot.  PLATO seen between heads of MIL and COOKIE.
COOKIE holds up a switch knife and tosses it over into the
circle.

                         PLATO
            Jim!

Full shot.  Circle as the knife falls at JIM's feet.  JIM
stoops and picks up his weapon, then faces BUZZ.  Then he
springs his blade.

                         BUZZ
            You know the action?  No cutting.
            Just sticking--jab real cool.

BUZZ hops from the parapet.  They begin stalking each other.
BUZZ slides his knife from hand to hand trying to hypnotize
JIM.  Suddenly he pokes out and pricks JIM's shirt.  The
group sighs "Ole!" JIM makes no effort at self-defense.
Silence.  BUZZ pricks JIM again, "Ole!"

                         BUZZ
                   (as he maneuvers)
            What you waiting on, Toreador?  I
            thought you wanted some action!

JIM cuts out half-heartedly.

                         BUZZ
            Big brave bull.  Hah!  Toro!  Hah!
            Hah!

                         GOON
            Moo!

                         BUZZ
            Come on--Fascinate us.  Impress us.
            What's happening?  Let's go!

                         JIM
            I don't want trouble.
                         BUZZ
                   (furious suddenly)
            You crud chicken!  You're wasting
            our time!

BUZZ viciously slaps JIM across the face.  JIM lashes out
and misses.  BUZZ hops back.

                         BUZZ
            Yeah--that's pretty close.  How
            about a little closer, Toreador?
            Cut off a button and you get to
            join the club!

Outside entrance of parking lot.  A uniformed GUIDE of
middle-age stares past camera.  Cries of "Ole," are heard in
the distance.

                         GUIDE
                   (turning)
            Mr. Minton!  Mr. Minton!  Trouble!

The LECTURER appears running.  He stops short at what he
sees, and blinks in the sunlight.

                         GUIDE
            Look.  There's your audience.

                         LECTURER
            Oh, I don't think so.  From the
            school?

Inside circle.  JIM is covered with sweat and about to drop.
He is getting the worst of it, still refusing to defend
himself.

Close shot.  PLATO.  He is looking on in despair.

                         GROUP
            Ole!  Ole!

Suddenly, with a cry, PLATO pushes through.

Inside circle as PLATO comes through.  His eyes are wild.
He holds a tire chain in his hand.

                         MIL
            Buzzy!  Look out!  He's got a chain!

                         BUZZ
                   (smiling as he sees PLATO)
            Hey!  Chicken Little!
BUZZ trips PLATO quickly and kicks him while he's down.
CRUNCH grabs the chain.

                         JIM
            All right--you want it, you got it!

Suddenly JIM transforms.  He bores forward expertly--pricks
BUZZ again and again.  Cries of Ole greet him.  BUZZ is
surprised.

Full shot.  Group.  We hear only the breathing of the
combatants.  Beyond we see the GUIDE approaching swiftly.
The LECTURER trails at a safe distance.

Closeup.  CRUNCH.  He looks up.  His smile fades.

                         CRUNCH
            Honk.  Let's split.

Group as they look off and see the GUIDE and LECTURER
approach.  BUZZ and JIM are both breathing hard.  PLATO is
getting to his feet.

                         BUZZ
            Split for what?  Couple old poopheads?

He folds up his knife and puts it away.  So does JIM.

                         JIM
            You satisfied or you want more?

                         BUZZ
            How 'bout you?  Say the word and
            you're cold, Jack--you're dead.

                         JUDY
            Buzzie--we better get out of here.

                         BUZZ
            What's eating you, Judy?  You want
            him alive?

                         JIM
            Where can we meet?

                         BUZZ
            Know the Millertown bluff?

                         COOKIE
            The bluff, Buzz!  That's dangerous
            up there.

                         BUZZ
            Draw him a picture, Chicken Little.
            Eight o'clock.  Cookie, you call
            Moose and get a couple cars.  We're
            going to have us some real kicks.
            Little chickie-run.  You been on
            chickie-runs before?

                         JIM
            Sure--that's all I do.

The GUIDE bursts in among them.  The LECTURER remains on the
fringe.

                         GUIDE
            All right--all of you--start moving!

                         JUDY
            You mean l'il ol' us?  What's the
            matter with the nice man?

                         GUIDE
            Don't clown with me.

                         BUZZ
            Why'nt you go suck on something sweet?

                         GUIDE
            You think you're tough?  I got a
            son twice your size and I can still
            handle him.

                         LECTURER
            Don't lose control, Mr. Jamison.  I
            think if we just explain--

                         GUIDE
            Explain to these?  They think they
            own the world!

                         CRUNCH
            The world is round!

                         MIL
            The world is flat!

                         COOKIE
            All the world's a stage!

There is wild laughter from the kids as they close around
the GUIDE and start edging him away, up the steps toward the
Planetarium balcony.

                         KIDS
            The world goes round the sun!
            Goodbye proud world!
            I got the world on a string!
            The world's my oyster!
            Hey!  A fish-eater!  Brain food.

They are gone.  The LECTURER looks after them then comes to
JIM.  JIM looks down at his shirt.  There are spots of blood.
PLATO opens it, spits on a handkerchief and starts to wipe
the blood away.

                         LECTURER
                   (smiling wanly, to JIM)
            Sometimes the world is too much
            with us, isn't it, son?  What was
            the disturbance?

                         JIM
            Nothing.

                         LECTURER
            You're bleeding.  Are you all right?

                         JIM
            I scratched my mosquito bites.  I'm
            fine.

LECTURER hesitates.

                         JIM
            I'm fine--thanks!

LECTURER goes.  JIM impatiently closes his shirt.

                         PLATO
            Are you really going to meet them?

                         JIM
            Who knows.  Plato?

                         PLATO
            What?

                         JIM
            What's a chickie-run?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Downstairs hall.  JIM's house.  A single light is burning.
JIM steals in from the kitchen, peers cautiously into the
living room, then starts up the stairs.  A crash is heard
above.  JIM stops, undecided whether to go or stay, then
moves quickly up the stairs, no longer trying to be quiet.

Upper hall.  JIM's house as JIM rises into view at the top
of stairs.  He sees a figure on hands and knees mopping
something off the rug.  Leaklight from the staircase dims
details.  An apron is tied around the figure's waist and its
bow sticks bravely in the air.

                         JIM
            Mom?

The figure straightens and turns around, smiling.  It is the
FATHER.  He is neatly dressed in his business suit but wears
a Mary Petty apron.

                         FATHER
            Hiya, Jimbo.

JIM leans against the wall, shaking his head and trying not
to laugh.  The FATHER laughs unhappily, trying to make it
all seem a joke.

                         FATHER
            You thought I was Mom?

                         JIM
            Yeah!

                         FATHER
            It's just this get-up.  The girl's
            out and I was bringing Mom's supper.

                         JIM
                   (giggling)
            And you dropped it?

                         FATHER
                   (laughing too)
            Yeah!  Shh!

                         JIM
            That's funny!

                         FATHER
            I better clean this up before she
            sees it.

He starts dabbing among the spilled dishes with a wet cloth.
JIM watches him.

                         JIM
            Let her see.  What could happen.

The FATHER continues dabbing.

                         JIM
            Dad--

The FATHER looks up at him.

                         JIM
            Dad--don't.  Don't.

JIM touches his FATHER's elbow, bringing him to his feet.
They look at each other a moment then JIM goes to his
bedroom.  The FATHER goes back to mopping up the mess.

Inside JIM's room as he comes in, shuts the door and throws
himself miserably on his bed.  He writhes as if the pain he
feels were physical.  Outside, radios are heard in the
night--tuned to different stations.  He feels under his
jacket and holds up his hand to the moonlight.  There is
blood on it.  He reaches up and takes his alarm clock and is
setting it as camera glides to his window and holds over the
rooftops.

Full shot.  JUDY's backyard.  Moonlight.  JUDY stands near
camera looking up at the moon.  The radios seem louder out
here.  One breaks through.

                         ANNOUNCER
            Time now for the seven o'clock news.
            Friends, the next time you go
            shopping.

                         JUDY'S FATHER (O.S.)
            Judy.

She wheels around.

Long shot.  The FATHER standing erect on back porch,
silhouetted against a window.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            What are you wishing for, Judy?

Med. shot.  JUDY.  She hasn't moved.

                         JUDY
                   (softly)
            I wasn't wishing.  I was looking at
            the moon.

Full shot.  Backyard featuring the FATHER.  We see him now
as a tall and handsome man.  There is something boyish and
appealing about him.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (singing lightly)
            "Man in the Moon, how came you
            there--
            Up in the sky where you are
            shining--
            Floating so high in the frosty
            air--?
            Oh, say--Man in the Moon!"--

JUDY comes forward, stands below him on the step.  Her look
is adoring.

                         JUDY
                   (astonished)
            How did you know that?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            We used to sing it in school.
                   (smiles)
            Don't look at me with such horror.
            They had schools in those days.

                         JUDY
            But the same song.  I think it's
            fantastic!

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            We were romantic then too--

                         JUDY
            Are you and Mom home tonight?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            No.  Why?

                         JUDY
            Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend
            an evening together for a change.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            With us old creeps?  Come on, we
            have to eat.

                         JUDY
                   (rising)
            Daddy--

He looks at her.

                         JUDY
            Good evening.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Hi.

He turns away and goes into the house.  She hesitates and
then follows.  Something in the moods has changed.  He has
neglected to hold the door for her.

Dining room.  JUDY's house as the FATHER comes to the head
of the table and takes his seat.  Three places are set.
JUDY follows.  She stands above his chair, looking down at
him as he drinks his tomato juice.

                         JUDY
                   (quietly, afraid)
            Didn't you forget something?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            What?

JUDY doesn't answer, but leans down and kisses him quickly
on the lips.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (continuing; shocked)
            What's the matter with you?

JUDY freezes, frightened.  He collects himself a little.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (continuing)
            You're too old for that kind of
            stuff, kiddo.  I thought you
            stopped doing that long ago.

                         JUDY
                   (very hurt)
            I didn't want to stop.

The mother enters briskly from another part of the house--an
attractive, brittle woman of thirty-five.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
            Didn't want to stop what?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Nothing.

                         JUDY
            I was talking to Dad.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
                   (calling to kitchen)
            Bertha!  You can serve the souffle!
                   (to FATHER)
            Fish souffle.
                   (to JUDY)
            You don't have to stand there,
            darling.  Drink your tomato juice.

JUDY slides into her chair reluctantly and unfolds her napkin.

                         JUDY
            I guess I just don't understand
            anything.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to
            change the subject.

                         JUDY
            Why?

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            I'd like to, that's all.  Girls
            your age don't do that.  You need
            an explanation?

                         JUDY
                   (very low)
            Girls don't love their father?
            Since when?  Since I got to be
            sixteen?

She half-rises to kiss him again.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Stop it now!  Sit down!

Suddenly the FATHER slaps her.  Even as he does it he is as
stunned as JUDY.  The mother stops eating.  She has never
seen such a display and is shocked.  He tries to control
himself by buttering a piece of bread.  There is a terrible
silence into which BEAU enters in his pajamas.  He runs to
his FATHER's chair, then halts--looking from face to face.
The FATHER puts an arm around him, hugs him almost savagely.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (thickly)
            Hi, rascal.

                         BEAU
                   (hushed)
            Hi.

JUDY rises, weeping.

                         JUDY
            May I please be excused?

She starts out.  The FATHER rises and follows after her.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (softly)
            Hey, hey, Glamorpuss.  I'm sorry.

She leaves the room, interrupting the joke he was going to
make.  He turns back to the table and sits down.  The MOTHER
rises and comes to him.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (continuing)
            I don't know what to do.  All of a
            sudden she's a problem.

The mother stands behind his chair.  She tips his head back
against her body and kneads his neck and shoulders.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
            She'll outgrow it, dear.  It's just
            the age.

                         BEAU
                   (in a sudden burst)
            The atomic age!

The door slams.

                         JUDY'S MOTHER
                   (kissing her
                   husband's hair)
            It's the age when nothing fits.

Inside JIM's room.  We see him lying on his bed as before.
His eyes are open.  The alarm clock goes off.  JIM starts as
if shot, then stops the wild ringing.  The time is seven-
forty-five.  He makes no move to leave the bed.  There is a
light tap on the door, then it opens and the FATHER is
there, seen in light from the hall and still wearing the apron.

                         FATHER
            You awake?

                         JIM
            Yes.

                         FATHER
            Listen--I took a steak out of the
            freezer.  I thought we could have a
            real old-fashioned stag party--just
            the two of us, what do you say?

                         JIM
            I'm not hungry.

The FATHER turns away.

                         JIM
            Hey--I want to ask you something.

                         FATHER
                   (happily)
            Shoot, Jimbo.

                         JIM
            Suppose you knew that you had to do
            something very dangerous--where you
            have to prove something you need to
            know--a question of honor.  Would
            you do it?

                         FATHER
                   (laughing)
            Is there some kind of trick answer?

                         JIM
            What would you do, Dad?

                         FATHER
                   (evading)
            I wouldn't do anything hasty.
            Let's get a little light on the
            subject.

The FATHER turns on the light and looks at JIM who is now
sitting on the edge of the bed.  He removes his jacket and
the bloody shirt is revealed.  The FATHER stares.

                         JIM
            Blood.

                         FATHER
            How'd that happen!  What kind of
            trouble you in?

                         JIM
            The kind we've been talking about.
            Can you answer me now?

                         FATHER
            Listen--nobody should make a snap
            decision--This isn't something you
            just--we ought to consider all the
            pros and cons--

                         JIM
            We don't have time.

                         FATHER
            We'll make time.  Where's some
            paper.  We'll make a list and if
            we're still stuck then we ought to
            get some advice--

He goes out, to the study next door.  JIM rises.

                         JIM
            What can you do when you have to be
            a man?

                         FATHER
            Well, now--

                         JIM
            Just give me a direct answer!
                   (pause)
            You going to stop me from going, Dad?

                         FATHER
            You know I never stop you from
            anything.  Believe me--you're at a
            wonderful age.  In ten years you'll
            look back on this and wish you were
            a kid again.

                         JIM
            Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an
            answer now!

                         FATHER
            I just want to show you how foolish
            you are.  When you're older you'll
            laugh at yourself for thinking this
            is so important--

During this, JIM has kicked off his shoes and put on his
boots and jacket and goes out.

Living room featuring stairs.  JIM comes running down the
stairs and out the kitchen door.

                         FATHER (O.S.)
            Jim?  Will you listen?  You can't
            go out till we--Jim!

The FATHER comes down the stairs, goes to the front door and
calls:

                         FATHER
            Jim?  Jim!

He goes to kitchen door, calls again, gets no answer, comes
back into the living room, sees he is still wearing the
apron.  He rips it off and throws it down--then starts for
the stairs.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The Plateau.  Moonlight.  Wind shrieks over the exposed
plateau, which is several hundred yards long.  It cuts into
the darkness like the prow of a ship and ends in empty air.
A dozen cars are scattered about, defining a sort of runway
in the center.  There are twenty kids present, but very
little talk.  Most of them belong to BUZZ's group but there
are a few whom we have not met before.  They stand in small
clots, murmuring and smoking.  The atmosphere is strung
tightly, like the moments before a dawn attack.  In b.g.
near the cliff's edge, are two cars of similar make and
model.  They face away from camera toward the edge of the
plateau.  There are no headlights anywhere...blackout
conditions.

MOOSE, a boy in a leather jacket and cheap yachting cap
stands guard between the cars, his back to us.  His hands
are on his hips.  His legs are spread.  Some girls drift in.

Another angle.  Plateau featuring PLATO as he wanders
through the crowd searching for JIM.  He passes BUZZ's car
where BUZZ, JUDY and the rest are eating hamburgers.  They
have all changed into fighting wardrobe.

                         BUZZ
                   (calling out)
            Hey, Chicken-Little.

PLATO stops.

                         BUZZ
            Where's Toreador?  He beg off?

                         PLATO
            He's not scared of you.

                         BUZZ
                   (laughing)
            Yeah?
                   (to GOON)
            Goon!  You seen that adolescent
            type anywheres?

                         COOKIE
            He won't show.

                         GOON
            Well, you going to wait all night?
            I'm getting nervous, man!  We got
            to do something!

                         CRUNCH
                   (looking off)
            Hey, Buzz!

                         BUZZ
            What?

                         COOKIE
            Over there.

BUZZ snaps on the spotlight again and swings it off.

Full shot.  JIM's car as JIM gets out and PLATO runs to him.

                         JIM
            How'd you get here?

                         PLATO
            I hitched.

                         JIM
            Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.

                         PLATO
            My personality's showing again.
            Should I leave?

                         JIM
            No.  It's okay.

BUZZ enters.

                         BUZZ
            Come on.  Let's see what we're
            driving.

JIM gets out; PLATO starts to follow.

                         BUZZ
            Just him.

                         JIM
            Stay there.

The two boys move away.  PLATO looks after them, hurt, then
goes to side of JUDY and stands.

Dolly shot.  JIM and BUZZ as they come forward.

                         BUZZ
            What you say your name was?

                         JIM
            Jim Stark.

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Gundersen.

                         JIM
            Hi.

                         BUZZ
            Glad to meet you.

They shake hands briefly as they walk.  They come to MOOSE
and stop.

                         MOOSE
            Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy.

                         BUZZ
            Flashlight?

MOOSE produces one and hands it to BUZZ who goes to one of
the guarded cars, motioning JIM to come, too.

Closer shot.  BUZZ, JIM and MOOSE seen as hood is raised,
revealing their faces beneath it.  BUZZ explores the motor
with the flashlight.

                         BUZZ
            Looks good.

                         MOOSE
            Clean as a whistle.  They both got
            plenty breeze.

                         BUZZ
            Look good to you?

                         JIM
            Sure.  It's fine.

                         BUZZ
            Okay.

He closes the hood.  Group moves across to other car.

JUDY and PLATO.  The other kids are behind them.  JUDY looks
to see that their attention isn't on her, then speaks
quietly to PLATO.

                         JUDY
            Is he your friend?

                         PLATO
            Yes.  My best friend.

                         JUDY
            What's he like?

                         PLATO
            Oh, I don't know.  You have to get
            to know him.  He doesn't say much
            but when he does you know he means
            it.  He's sincere.

                         JUDY
            Well, that's the main thing--don't
            you think so?

                         PLATO
            Maybe next summer he's going to
            take me hunting with him--and
            fishing.  I want him to teach me
            how and I bet he won't get mad if I
            goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really
            James but he likes Jim more.
                   (laughing)
            People he really likes--he lets
            call him "Jamie."

                         JUDY
            Want to finish my hamburger?  I
            only took a bite.

                         PLATO
            Okay.

Full shot.  Guarded cars.  JIM is close in f.g. at wheel of
his car.  BUZZ is beyond, at wheel of his.  Both boys are
gunning their engines, listening critically.  JIM lets his
idle.

JUDY, GOON and group.  They watch in silent anticipation.
PLATO starts away from them.

Traveling shot.  PLATO hurrying away from the group.  He
stops, looking off.

JIM and BUZZ.  PLATO in distance.

                         BUZZ
            Better try the doors.  Jump out.

JIM opens his door.

                         BUZZ
            No--quick, man!  You got to break
            quick.

JIM shuts his door and tries again.  So does BUZZ.  Then
both boys walk forward to the edge.  Neither says a word.
BUZZ puts his hand on JIM's shoulder.

High angle.  The edge of the bluff (process).  JIM and BUZZ
are directly below us.  Under them the plateau falls steeply
away in a sheer drop of a hundred feet to the ocean below.

Two shot.  JIM and BUZZ.  JIM is staring below.  He is
beginning to perspire.  He lights a cigarette.  Without
taking his hand from JIM's shoulder, BUZZ borrows the
cigarette from his lips, takes a drag and hands it back.
JIM takes another puff then tosses it into the abyss.

                         BUZZ
                   (quietly)
            This is the edge, boy.  This is the
            end.

                         JIM
            Yeah.

                         BUZZ
            I like you, you know?

                         JIM
            Buzz?  What are we doing this for?

                         BUZZ
                   (still quiet)
            We got to do something.  Don't we?

Long shot.  JIM and BUZZ with PLATO in f.g.  JIM and BUZZ
appear to him as two close friends.  Suddenly they break and
go, without speaking further, to their cars.  They back up
to the opposite end of the plateau, headlights dark.  PLATO
follows them with his gaze.

Group shot.  GOON and others looking up as the cars glide by.

Med. shot.  JUDY waiting as BUZZ and JIM move into starting
position next to her.  JUDY goes to BUZZ.  JIM is in b.g.--
looking on.

                         JUDY
            Feel okay?

                         BUZZ
            Give me some dirt.

She bends out of sight for a moment as BUZZ goes on talking,
then hands him the dirt.  He rubs it into his palms.

                         BUZZ
            Hey, Toreador!  She signals.  We
            head for the edge.  The first guy
            who jumps--chicken!

JUDY and BUZZ kiss, without much interest.

                         BUZZ
            What's happening?

                         JUDY
            Good luck, Buzz.

She starts out, without kissing him again.

                         JIM
                   (calling softly)
            Judy.

Med. shot.  JIM's car as JUDY comes to him.

                         JIM
            Me too.

She looks at him a moment then bends and hands him some dirt.
Their heads touch for an instant.

                         JIM
            Thank you.

She breaks the look and hurries away.

Long shot.  The cars.  They are lined up in two rows--
headlights facing each other.  JUDY comes into shot.  When
she gets near camera, she stops and turns back to face them.

                         BUZZ
            Hit your lights!

Suddenly the headlights of all the cars come on full.

Reverse shot.  JUDY.  She is in the center of the glare.
Behind her we see the other kids filing out of their cars,
hurrying toward the edge of the bluff.  The sound of the two
motors revving then dying and revving again.

Inside JIM's car.  JIM grips the wheel firmly, relaxes his
hands to rub his palms together and crack his knuckles.  He
grips the wheel again.  Steps on the accelerator, winding
his engine into a roar.  He lets up, looks tensely at--

BUZZ in his car.  His chin juts forward.  He lets go of the
wheel, starts to comb his hair.

Slow pan shot.  Spectators staring off at the cars.  A boy
has his arm around the girl in front of him, his cheek
against hers.  Both are looking off.  Some of the kids smoke.
All are involved in the blasting of engines.

PLATO among the spectators near edge of the bluff.  He is
chewing his lip.  Camera pans down to show that the fingers
of both his hands are tightly crossed.

Close shot.  JUDY staring tensely into the glare.  Suddenly
she raises her hands high above her head.

Close shot.  JIM sweating it out.  He leans forward,
squinting, ready.

Close shot.  BUZZ.  He puts his comb between his teeth and
clamps it hard.  He settles himself for the run.

Long shot.  Plateau.  The cars are in close, seen from the
rear.  JUDY is a small distant figure, arms stretched high.
The exhaust blasts.  Now she drops her arms.  The cars leap
ahead.

Med. shot.  JUDY.  She whirls to see the cars snap by, then
begins running up the center of the plateau between the
lines of spectators.

Full shot.  Spectators.  Shooting over their shoulders as
the cars approach and scream past.

Pit shot.  Cars.  As they approach, gaining speed, and
thunder over the camera.

Inside JIM's car. (Process).  He is tense.

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  His hands hard on the wheel.
The comb is still between his teeth.  He begins edging
toward the door on his left.

Moving close shot.  JUDY biting hard on her finger, as she
runs forward.

Close shot.  PLATO.  Both hands cover his mouth.  The
fingers are still crossed.

Inside JIM's car. (Process).  As he edges to his left.  He
is driving with one hand.  He opens the door, gets set for
his jump.

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  He reaches for the door
handle and misses.  As he raises his arm to reach again, the
strap of his windbreaker sleeve slips over the handle.  He
looks down in panic, then back at the drop ahead.  He tugs
but cannot get the sleeve loose.

Closeup.  PLATO staring.  He shuts his eyes tight and keeps
them shut.

Shooting at backs of the two cars as they race through the
row of lights toward the edge.

Inside JIM's car. (Process).  His face is soaked.  He looks
once toward BUZZ--then ahead.  His eyes widen in fear.  He
shoves left and flings himself forward, and out.

Outside JIM's car as he sprawls forward--into camera.

Inside BUZZ's car. (Process).  BUZZ leans way forward now.
He seems to rise in his seat.  His mouth opens and the comb
falls out.

Full shot spectators staring in disbelief.  Suddenly a youth
ducks his face into the neck of his girlfriend so he cannot
see.  At the same instant--

                         CROWD
                   (in a single breath)
            Oh!

Rear view.  Edge of the bluff as the two cars go over.
There is NO human sound.

Close shot.  JIM as he stops rolling.

BUZZ's car in flight. (Special effects).  The car soars
through the night, the vehicle of a terrible journey.

Med. shot.  BUZZ. (Process).  Surprise has gone.  He rides
lightly on the thrill of his last moment--then suddenly, his
face twists in a spasm of protest and loss.

The kids staring at his flight.

JIM unaware of the disaster--glad he made it.

Low angle.  Edge of the bluff.  With headlights blazing,
both cars dive down.

Med. shot.  JUDY standing frozen as the spectators shove
past and around her.

Wide angle.  Edge of the bluff as spectators swarm to it,
stand looking down.

JIM on hands and knees, trying to rise.  Legs rush by him,
knock him onto his face.

Long shot. (Special effects).  Both cars plunge into the
ocean below.

JIM at edge of bluff.  He is pushing through spectators.

                         JIM
                   (a harsh whisper)
            Where's Buzz!  Where's Buzz!

PLATO working his way through the crowd.

                         PLATO
                   (calling)
            Jim!  Jim!

CRUNCH.  CRUNCH looks up as he hears JIM's repeated cry.
JIM enters behind him, continuing blindly on his way.

                         CRUNCH
                   (tight fury)
            Down there!  Down there is Buzz!

JIM looks over the edge.

Rear view.  Spectators.  A siren wail approaches.  The kids
wheel and scatter, panicking past the camera.

Close shot.  MOOSE.  Looks at JIM.  Runs.

Close shot.  GOON.  Turns.  Runs.

Med. shot.  JIM seen between legs of hurrying kids.  The
sirens and the pounding of their feet on the hard turf.  JIM
is sitting on the edge of the bluff.  PLATO rushes in, stops
short as he sees him.

                         PLATO
            Come on, Jim!  We got to get out of
            here!

JIM doesn't move.  PLATO grabs his arm and yanks.

                         PLATO
            Get up!  Get up!  Come on!

JIM stands.  PLATO pushes him.

                         PLATO
            Go on!  Move!

They start away, PLATO still pushing from behind.

Med. shot.  JUDY.  She is standing alone in the wind on the
emptying plateau.  JIM and PLATO move past in the distance.
JIM sees her and stops.

Close shot.  JUDY.  She is shuddering violently but there
are no tears.  She seems not to see or hear or be aware of
anything around her.

Full shot.  JIM and PLATO watching JUDY.  JIM moves toward
her, camera panning with him and leaving PLATO behind.  JIM
stands before JUDY until she notices him.  He shakes his
head for all the sorrow he feels, but no words come.
Tentatively he offers her his hand.  After a moment, she
takes it.  She knows only that help is being offered and
that she will accept it with trust.  JIM leads her away
toward the car.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

High long shot.  JIM's street.  Night.  There is no movement
anywhere.  In the house bordering the street a few lights
still burn.  JIM's car approaches out of distance and slows
when it reaches the alley.

Med. shot.  JIM's car as it slows and stops.  JIM, JUDY and
PLATO in the front seat.  JUDY has the door open before the
car even stops.  She is shaking, agitated and withdrawn.

                         JUDY
                   (hardly audible)
            This is fine--

She gets out and starts away, leaving door open.

                         JIM
                   (calling quietly)
            Judy.  Will you be okay?

PLATO looks at him.  JUDY hesitates.  JIM raises a hand to
her in a shy farewell.  She smiles vaguely, then hurries
away from them.

Near JIM's backyard (alley).  JIM and PLATO.

                         JIM
            I got to go in.  You better get
            home too.
                   (touches PLATO)
            Hey--what?

                         PLATO
            Why don't you come home with me?  I
            mean nobody's home at my house--and
            I'm not tired, are you?  I don't
            have many--people I can talk to.

                         JIM
            Who has?

                         PLATO
            If you want to come we could talk
            and then in the morning we could
            have breakfast like my dad used
            to--
                   (pauses--then
                   excitedly as though
                   an idea had suddenly
                   struck him)
            Gee...if you could only have been
            my father...we could...

                         JIM
                   (interrupting)
            Hey...you flipped--or something?
            You better take off...

                         PLATO
                   (suddenly, pleasantly)
            O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my
            scooter.  See you tomorrow.

                         JIM
            Yeah.

PLATO turns, walks up the alley to the street.  JIM goes
into his kitchen door.

Hallway.  JUDY's house.  Three doors open onto it: one is
closed--this is JUDY's room:--another, leading into BEAU's
room is open, but the room beyond is dark: the third, also
open, reveals the bedroom of JUDY's parents.  As JUDY comes
into the hallway, the parents, who are reading in their
beds, look up.  JUDY hesitates, then starts toward her own
room.

                         BEAU (O.S.)
                   (quietly)
            Hello, little cute sister.

JUDY stops.  BEAU appears at his door in white pajamas, a
small ghost.  JUDY looks at him.

                         BEAU
            Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor-
            puss, sweetie--

JUDY touches BEAU's head and tries to smile.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (calling from his bed)
            Beau!  You belong in bed!

BEAU flees.  JUDY turns without another glance at her
parents, and opens the door of her room.

Inside bedroom of JUDY's parents.  As JUDY slams her bedroom
door o.s., the FATHER reacts.  Perhaps, he wishes she had
given him a chance to say goodnight.  The MOTHER, who use
reading glasses, looks up at the slam.  Then she looks over
at her husband, shrugs when she catches his gaze, and goes
back to her magazine.

Inside JIM's living room.  The television is on, but only a
hum comes from it, and the screen is a flickering gray.  The
FATHER sits lumpily in a chair by the fireplace, still
dressed but with his collar open.  The sound of JIM's step
in the dining room makes him open his eyes.  Fear of facing
his son makes him shut them again.  The boy comes in, a
bottle of milk in his hand.  Seeing his FATHER there, he
stops short--his impulse is to flee.  Instead he comes in
and looks down at the sleeping man whose eyelids, fluttering
in the FATHER's masquerade of sleep, make him seem to be
having a dream.  JIM is torn between his desire to leave and
his need to speak.  He turns off the television quietly,
then lies down on the couch across the way.  He mumbles the
things he would say to his FATHER and the answers he feels
he would get.  The old man opens his eyes once, sees the boy
there, head banging upside down from the couch.  Then he
shuts them again.

Upside down long shot.  Room (JIM's viewpoint).  Suddenly,
inverted in his vision, the MOTHER appears at the head of
the stairs, in bathrobe and nightgown.  She pauses a moment,
then runs down crying:

                         MOTHER
            He's home!  You're home!  You're
            all right!

The camera rights itself suddenly.

JIM as he completes his turn, pulling his head up and sitting.

FATHER as he pretends to awaken with a start.

Full shot, room as the MOTHER hurries to JIM, holds him,
inspects him, kisses him.

                         MOTHER
            What happened, darling.  We were so
            worried.  I was going to take a
            sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till
            I knew you were home.

                         JIM
            I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I
            have to talk to you both.  And Dad
            this time you got to give me an
            answer.

                         FATHER
            Go ahead.

                         JIM
            I'm in terrible trouble.--You know
            that big high bluff near Miller-
            town Junction?

                         FATHER
            Sure--there was a bad accident
            there.  They showed the pictures on
            T.V.

                         JIM
            I was in it.

                         MOTHER
            How!

                         JIM
            It doesn't matter how.  I was
            driving a stolen car--

                         MOTHER
            Do you enjoy doing this to me or
            what--

                         JIM
            Mom--I'm not--

                         MOTHER
            And you wanted him to make a list!

                         FATHER
            Will you let him tell it!

                         JIM
            She never wants to hear.  She
            doesn't care!

                         MOTHER
            I guess when I nearly died giving
            birth to you--that shows how much I
            don't care!

                         FATHER
            Just relax, please relax!

                         JIM
            I told you Dad, it was a question
            of honor.  They called me chicken--
            you know, chicken!  I had to go or
            I would never have been able to
            face any of those kids again.  So I
            got in one of these cars and a boy
            called Buzz got in the other.  We
            had to drive fast and jump before
            the cars went over the edge of the
            bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz
            didn't.  He was killed.

                         MOTHER
            Good Lord!

                         JIM
            I can't keep it to myself anymore--

                         FATHER
            Well, just get it off your chest, son.

                         JIM
            That's not what I mean.  I've never
            done anything right.  I've been
            going around with my head in a
            sling for years...I don't want to
            drag you into this but I can't help
            it.  I don't think I can prove
            anything by going around pretending
            I'm tough any more, so maybe you
            look like one thing but you still
            feel like another.

                         FATHER
            You're absolutely right!

                         JIM
            Are you listening to me?  You're
            involved in this!  I want to go to
            the police and tell them I was
            mixed up in this thing tonight?

                         FATHER
            You what?

                         MOTHER
            No!

                         FATHER
            Did anyone see you there?  I mean
            did they get your license number or
            anything?

                         JIM
            I don't think so--

                         FATHER
            Well--

                         MOTHER
            What about the other boys--Do you
            think they'll go to the police?

                         JIM
            What's that got to do with it?

                         MOTHER
            Why should you be the only one.

                         FATHER
            Look Jim.  Far be it from me to
            tell you what to do, but there's--

                         MOTHER
            Are you going to preach now?  Are
            we going to have a sermon?

                         FATHER
            I'm just explaining what you mean!
            You can't be an idealist all your
            life!  Nobody thanks you for
            sticking your neck out!

                         MOTHER
            That's right!

                         JIM
            Except yourself!

                         FATHER
            Will you wait a minute?

                         JIM
            You don't want me to go.

                         MOTHER
            No!  I don't want you to go to the
            police!  There were other people
            and why should you be the only one
            involved!

                         JIM
            But I am involved!  We're all
            involved, Mom!  A boy was killed!
            I don't see how we can get out of
            that by pretending it didn't happen!

                         FATHER
            You know you did wrong.  That's the
            main thing, isn't it?

                         JIM
            No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing!
            You always told me to tell the
            truth.  You think you can just turn
            that off?

                         MOTHER
            He's not saying that!  He's saying
            don't volunteer!

                         JIM
            Just tell a little white lie?

                         FATHER
            You'll learn as you get a little
            older, Jim.

                         JIM
            I don't want to learn that!

                         MOTHER
            Well, it doesn't matter anyhow--
            because we're moving.

                         JIM
            No!  You're not tearing me loose
            any more.

                         MOTHER
            Do I have to spell it out?

                         JIM
            You're not going to use me as an
            excuse again, Mom.  Every time you
            can't face yourself you want to
            move and you say it's because of me
            or the neighborhood or some other
            phony excuse.  Now I want to do one
            thing right and I'm not letting you
            run away.
                   (silence)
            Dad?

                         FATHER
            Son--this is all happening so fast--

                         JIM
            You better give me something, Dad.
            You better give me something
                   (stops as he sees the
                   emptiness in them)
            Mom?

                         MOTHER
            Jimmy, you're very young--and a
            foolish decision now could wreck
            your whole life.

                         JIM
            Dad--answer her--aren't you going
            to stand up for me?

The FATHER is mute, helpless...  Suddenly JIM screams.

                         JIM
            Dad?

He leaps at his FATHER, dragging him to his feet, hands at
the man's throat.

                         MOTHER
            Stop it!  You'll kill him!  Jim!
            Do you want to kill your father?

Suddenly JIM loosens his hands and rises.  He looks swiftly
at each of them--moves a few steps toward the door, looks
back at them again--then rushes out of the house.  The
parents stand frozen.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Outside Precinct Station.  JIM's car comes to a stop at the
curb.  JIM gets out and approaches the flight of steps
leading up the entrance.  A bare bulb on either side is the
only illumination.  As he mounts the first step, the double
doors above him swing open revealing several people.  JIM
stops short.  So do they.

Low angle.  CRUNCH, MOOSE and their parents.  JIM's back in
f.g.  The boys stare down at him.

High angle.  JIM (from the boys' point of view) as he stares
up at them.  MOOSE's father takes his arm and starts him
down the stairs, the others moving too.

                         MOOSE
            Let go of me--

                         MOOSE'S FATHER
            You want a good crack in the mouth?

JIM starts forward up the steps.  CRUNCH grabs him.

                         CRUNCH
            This place appeal to you or something?

They move down the steps as JIM breaks away and continues up.
He goes through the doors.

Inside doors as JIM comes through and stops.  He looks back
through the glass.  We see the group reach the curb where
their cars are parked.  There is a brief discussion which we
cannot hear, then CRUNCH and MOOSE move off to MOOSE's car.
JIM turns back.  He looks worried as he passes camera.

Med. shot.  CRUNCH and MOOSE.  They stop at MOOSE's car and
look back at the entrance.  The parents are seen beyond
them, getting into their cars.  CRUNCH is near tears with
anger.

                         CRUNCH
            What's he going to pull--

                         MOOSE
            Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him
            up like the rest of--

                         CRUNCH
            You see any cops?

                         MOOSE'S FATHER
                   (yelling)
            You monsters start home.  We're
            going to--

                         MOOSE
            Yeah.  Yeah.

                         MOOSE'S FATHER
            We're following you so better get
            there.

                         CRUNCH
            You see any cops?

                         MOOSE
            No--

                         CRUNCH
            He's going to cheese, I tell you.
            Nobody arrested him!

                         MOOSE
            I think I should go home.

                         CRUNCH
            No.  We're going to bring him down.

                         MOOSE
            Crunch--my father's--You going to
            kill him?

                         CRUNCH
                   (crying)
            You clean out of your head?  Come on!

CRUNCH gets into the car.  MOOSE follows.  They gun the
motor and throw the car into a sharp U-turn.  MOOSE'S FATHER
jumps into his car.  He steps on the starter but nothing
happens--just the empty whirring, over and over.  Finally it
starts, but the boys have gone.

Inside Precinct Station.  Juvenile division.  A desk
sergeant is writing in the record book.  Facing him across
the desk and handcuffed to an officer is a young hoodlum,
very different in appearance from the kids we have met--a
typical duck-tail 'cat'.

                         SERGEANT
                   (spelling)
            W-O-J-T-what?

                         HOODLUM
            O-W-I-C-Z.  Wojtowicz.  What's the
            matter, man?  That's the craziest
            name in town!  It swings!

                         JIM
            Excuse me--but--You know where I
            can find--I mean I don't remember
            his last name--

                         SERGEANT
            Look--can't you see I'm writing?

                         HOODLUM
                   (combing his duck-tail)
            Man, this cat never stops.  He just
            keeps going like Big Jay at a session!
                         OFFICER
            Shut up.

                         HOODLUM
            He's writing a book about me--

                         SERGEANT
            What I could write about you they
            wouldn't print.

                         JIM
            I think his first name's Ray--I
            have to see him.  It's very important.

                         SERGEANT
            What's the charge?

                         OFFICER
            Assault with a deadly weapon.

                         JIM
            Listen--

                         SERGEANT
                   (annoyed)
            He's not here.  He's not at
            Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where
            he is.  He's out on a call and
            he'll be out all night.  How old
            are you?

                         JIM
            My parents know I'm out.  They know
            I'm here.

                         SERGEANT
            Come back tomorrow.

                         JIM
            I'll wait for him.

                         SERGEANT
            Why don't you come back tomorrow,
            son?
                   (to hoodlum)
            Ever been booked before?

JIM turns away, notices a phone on the wall--puts in a coin,
asks for a number.

Bedroom of JUDY's parents.  Through an open door we hear a
radio playing-- a late disc-jockey show for teenagers in
which numbers are dedicated by request.  JUDY'S MOTHER and
FATHER are in bed, FATHER has phone in his hand.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Who wants her?  Who?  Jim who?
            Never heard of you.

He hangs up phone, looks at his wife.  She rolls over in bed.
The FATHER turns off the bed lamp, then sits up, worried in
the dark.

JUDY's bedroom.  It is her radio we have heard.  She turns
off light, opens the door a crack, and looks out toward her
parent's room.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Traveling shot.  PLATO.  He is coming up the walk to his
house.  When PLATO has come a few feet, somebody whistles.
PLATO and camera stop.  Short, quiet whistles come from the
boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk.  PLATO
turns and starts to run, camera following.  He gets to his
door, tries the key, but in his panic it will not go into
the lock.  Suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around.
CRUNCH stands above him.  GOON closes in from the other side.
All very tense and hotted up!

                         PLATO
            What do you want!

                         CRUNCH
            You know what we want.  We want
            your friend.

                         GOON
            We got eyes for him.

                         PLATO
            Listen, you guys ought to go home.
            The cops are cruising every--

                         GOON
            Where does he live?

PLATO reaches up swiftly and rings the bell.  GOON grabs him.
CRUNCH cracks him.

                         CRUNCH
            You better tell us and I'm not
            kidding.

                         PLATO
            My old man's got a gun.

                         GOON
            His old man's got a gun.  What do
            you think of that!
                   (drives a hard blow
                   at PLATO's belly)
            Your friend talked--
                   (belts him again)
            Now you talk!  Talk!

The door opens and the NEGRO WOMAN is there.  CRUNCH sends
PLATO spinning into the house past her.  He falls.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (yelling)
            What you doing!  What you doing to
            him!  You clear out of here 'fore I
            call the police!

She swings at CRUNCH who faces her, challenging.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now!

                         MOOSE
            Let's go, Crunch.

They turn and move past camera.  PLATO gets up off the floor.
We hear the sound of a heap starting.  The NEGRO WOMAN
closes the door.

Inside PLATO's foyer as NEGRO WOMAN bolts the door.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            Why you like to mix with bad boys
            like that?  Why you get in trouble
            all the--

                         PLATO
            I have to go out.  I have to warn him.

He starts up the stairs.  She follows him heavily.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            You not going anywhere!  You
            staying home while your mama's away.

Bedroom of PLATO's mother, a lacy affair with imported dolls
on the pillows.  PLATO rushes in, opens the drawer of the
night-table and pulls out a gun.  He checks to see that it
is loaded.  The NEGRO WOMAN appears in the door and stares
at him, turns on the light which illuminates the bed-lamp.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            John!  What you doing with that!
            You leave that be!  Put it down
            before you hurt yourself.  Hear me?

But PLATO moves past her and out of the room.  She turns
after him.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (continuing)
            John!  You stay home!  John!  John!

The slam of a door is heard below.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

JIM's garage.  Night.  JUDY waiting inside.  JIM's car pulls
in, a radio going softly.  He turns the motor off and is
about to turn off the radio when we hear the announcer:

                         ANNOUNCER
            Coming up now another request--this
            time from the boys down at Anna's
            Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement
            of a great oldie in rhythm and
            blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to
            you--from Buzz.

JIM stares at the radio, then turns it off.

Another angle.

                         JUDY
            They'll be looking for you.

                         JIM
            They saw where I jumped!  I didn't
            chicken!  What do I have to do--
            kill myself?

                         JUDY
            It doesn't matter to them.

                         JIM
            You were looking for me, weren't you?

                         JUDY
                   (a small voice)
            No--I was just--maybe--

                         JIM
            I tried to call you before.
                         JUDY
            I thought so.

                         JIM
            Want some milk?

JUDY comes forward.

                         JIM
            That's all I can do when I'm
            nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a
            slug.

She shakes her head.  He takes a sip.

                         JIM
            You still pretty upset?

                         JUDY
            I'm numb.

She is shuddering a little.

                         JIM
            You cold?

                         JUDY
            Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold.
            I guess just about everybody's cold.

                         JIM
            I swear, sometimes, you just want
            to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what
            am I going to do?  I can't go home
            again.

                         JUDY
            Neither can I.

                         JIM
            No?  Why not?
                   (no answer)
            You know something?  Sometimes I
            figure I'll never live to see my
            next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?

                         JUDY
            No.

                         JIM
            Every day I look in the mirror and
            say, "What?  You still here?" Man!

They laugh a little.

                         JIM
            Hey!  You smiled!

JUDY shakes her head--beginning to warm to him.

                         JIM
            Like even today.  I woke up this
            morning, you know?  And the sun was
            shining and everything was nice.
            Then the first thing that happens
            is I see you and I thought this is
            going to be one terrific day so you
            better live it up, boy, 'cause
            tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.

                         JUDY
            I'm sorry I treated you mean today.
            You shouldn't believe what I say
            when I'm with the kids.  Nobody
            acts sincere.

                         JIM
            Why'd you get mixed up with them?
            You don't have to prove anything.

                         JUDY
            If you knew me you wouldn't say that.

                         JIM
            I don't think you trust anybody, do
            you?

                         JUDY
            Why?

                         JIM
            I'm getting that way, too.

                         JUDY
                   (looks at him)
            Have you ever gone with anyone who--

                         JIM
            Sure.  Lots of times.

                         JUDY
            So have I.  But I've never been in
            love.  Isn't that awful?

                         JIM
                   (smiling)
            Awful?  No.  It's just lonely.
            It's the loneliest time.

She looks up.  He kisses her forehead.

                         JUDY
            Why did you do that?

                         JIM
            I felt like it.

                         JUDY
            Your lips are soft when you kiss.

JUDY rises.

                         JIM
            Where you going?

                         JUDY
            I don't know, but we can't stay here.

                         JIM
            Where can we go?  I can't go back
            into that zoo.

                         JUDY
            I'm never going back.

                         JIM
            Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO
            showed me before.  An old deserted
            mansion near the planetarium
                   (rises)
            Would you go with me?

JUDY hesitates.

                         JIM
            You can trust me, Judy.

                         JUDY
            I feel as if I'm walking under water.

They start out.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Inside bathroom.  JIM's house.  The water is running in the
sink and JIM's father is fixing a stomach settler.  Gradually
he grows aware of a heavy pounding which insinuates itself
above the splash of water.  The FATHER pauses, then turns
off the tap.  The pounding continues.  JIM'S MOTHER appears
at the bathroom door.  She is seen in the mirror tying her
robe.

                         MOTHER
            Frank?  I'm frightened.

                         FATHER
            What's that pounding?

                         MOTHER
            I don't know.  First I thought it
            was Jim but--

                         FATHER
            He's home.  I heard the car.

                         MOTHER
            Are you going down there?

                         FATHER
            Look--just relax, will you?

The pounding ceases.

                         FATHER
            See?  It stopped.

                         MOTHER
            I still think you should go down.

He goes out of the bathroom, into the hall.

Foyer.  JIM's house as the FATHER comes down the stairs,
turning on the light as he comes.  He reaches the door and
pauses.  The MOTHER stops midway down the stairs.

                         FATHER
                   (through the door)
            Who's there?
                   (silence)
            Anyone there?

                         MOTHER
                   (low; at balustrade)
            Open it.

The FATHER opens the door and looks up sharply.

Close shot.  Door.  FATHER's head in f.g. as he stares at it.
Nailed to the door by its outstretched wings, its head
hanging in an attitude of crucifixion, is the freshly killed
carcass of a chicken.  Low whistles are heard from outside.
The FATHER, frightened, looks out into the night.

Full shot.  Front lawn and street.  Shooting over the
FATHER's head.  The whistling continues.
                         FATHER
                   (hoarsely)
            Who's out there?

                         VOICE
            Where's your son?

                         FATHER
            What?

                         ANOTHER VOICE
            Where's your baby boy gone to,
            Daddy?  We want him.

Suddenly the FATHER slams the door and rushes past us into
the house.

Full shot.  Foyer as the FATHER rushes to the bottom of the
stairs.

                         FATHER
            Look in his room!

The MOTHER disappears.

                         FATHER
            Jim!  Jim!

The FATHER dashes into the living room, then into the hall
again and down through the kitchen door.

Back yard as the FATHER comes out.  He closes the door
quietly and calls in a low voice:

                         FATHER
            Son?

He stares around the yard, then hurries to the garage.
JIM's car is missing.  He looks up suddenly.

Reverse shot.  JUDY'S FATHER seen across the alley wall.  He
is standing in his own back yard.

                         JUDY'S FATHER
            Is anything wrong?  I'm your neighbor.

Med. shot.  JIM'S FATHER.  He smiles feebly.

                         FATHER
            Oh, no, thanks.  I just wanted to--
            to be sure my garage was closed.

JIM'S FATHER closes his garage door and walks back toward
his house.

                         MOTHER (O.S.)
            Is he there?

                         FATHER
            No, honey.  No, he's not here.

He starts for the house again after a quick look in the
direction of JUDY'S FATHER.

Full shot.  JUDY's back yard.  JUDY'S FATHER watches MR.
STARK disappear, then...

                         JUDY'S FATHER
                   (softly)
            Judy?

The alley by JIM's house.  PLATO drives up on scooter.  He
checks the garage, sees JIM's car is gone, is about to take
off in confusion, hears door slam in JIM's back yard, shuts
off engine, fixes tie, combs hair, goes in the fence gate to
JIM's back yard.

Full shot.  JIM's back yard.  JIM'S FATHER is coming toward
him.  JIM'S FATHER and PLATO simultaneously say:

                         FATHER
            What are you doing?

                         PLATO
            Where's Jim?

                         FATHER
            I don't know.  Do you--do you know
            where he is?

                         PLATO
            No.  No, I don't.

Closeup.  PLATO remembers about the mansion--then almost to
himself:

                         PLATO
            I know where--

Back to full shot.  FATHER and PLATO.

                         PLATO
            Hope I didn't bother you.  Goodnight.

He runs to scooter.

                         FATHER
            Hey, come back here.  Who are you?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Split screen montage.  It begins with a telephone ringing
alone in the corner of the screen.  As camera moves back we
see that the phone is in an office at Juvenile Hall.  RAY is
standing by, trying to make sense out of the incoming reports.

The other part of the screen lights up and becomes:

Bedroom of PLATO'S MOTHER where the NEGRO WOMAN is speaking
hysterically into the phone.

Bedroom of JUDY's parents.  The FATHER is on the phone.
BEAU has awakened and is crying.  His MOTHER tries to divert
him.

JIM's bedroom.  JIM'S FATHER sits disconsolately on the bed,
the phone in his hand.  He is talking earnestly.

During this the sound of the telephone ringing has increased
to become the sound of many and this has been submerged in a
deep rising riot of sirens whose wail mounts higher and
higher until:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Full shot.  Planetarium.  Moonlight.  A lone siren wails in
distance.  Aside from this, all is very still.  Camera pans
past the dome and settles on an isolated mansion set high on
a hill nearby.  Stone balustrades drop down to sunken
gardens where the grass has gone to seed around a waterless
fountain.

Closer shot.  Mansion.  Night.  A Mediterranean villa with a
large domed solarium which is connected to the main building
by a low enclosed arcade.  A crash and the falling of
splintered glass is heard.

Long shot.  Promenade.  Shooting through pillars of the main
entrance portico, down the long promenade outside arcade.
Two figures, seen in the distance, are disappearing through
a window.  Camera tracks down promenade until it reaches a
broken window through which JIM is just disappearing.  When
he gets inside, he reaches back and takes his leather jacket
which has been spread on the sill to protect them from
splinters, shakes it out and puts it on.  Running footsteps
are heard approaching.  JIM looks out nervously.  PLATO
bursts in, out of breath.

                         PLATO
            Jim!

                         JIM
            Who's that!

                         PLATO
            It's me!

                         JIM
            How'd you find me?  What's happening?

                         PLATO
            They're looking for you!--

                         JIM
            Yeah?

                         PLATO
            Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and
            everybody!  I think they're going
            to kill you.

                         JIM
            We know.

                         PLATO
            They think you told the police on
            them.  They--who's in there?

                         JIM
            Judy.

                         PLATO
            Help me in!

JIM gives PLATO a hand over the windowsill.

Inside arcade.  JIM and JUDY are seen in an entering shaft
of moonlight.  PLATO hits the floor and disappears into
darkness.

                         JIM
            Hey where'd you go?

                         PLATO
            I'm here.  Shut up.

                         JIM
            Come out come out wherever you are!

                         PLATO
            Shut up.  Are you nuts?

                         JIM
            No.  I'm scared.

A match flares and lights a candle on an antique Spanish
candelabra.  PLATO is revealed bending over it.  He lights
the other candles through the following:

                         PLATO
            We're safe here.  I hope.
                   (holds up candelabra)
            What do you think?

                         JIM
                   (gazing around)
            Wow!  Well now-there-then!

His wonderment is justified.  The floor of the arcade is
marble and there are marble benches and neo-Roman busts
lining the walls.

                         PLATO
            Isn't it crazy?

                         JIM
            Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for
            the summer.

                         JUDY
            Oh, Jim!

                         JIM
            No--come on.  Should we rent or are
            we in a buying mood, dear?

                         JUDY
                   (laughing)
            You decide, darling.  Remember our
            budget.

                         PLATO
            Don't give it a thought.  Only
            three million dollars a month!

                         JUDY
            Oh, we can manage that!  I'll
            scrimp and save and work my fingers
            to the bone...

                         JIM
            Why don't we just rent it for the
            season?

                         JUDY
            You see, we've just--oh, you tell
            him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I
            could die!

                         JIM
            Well--we're newlyweds.

                         JUDY
            There's just one thing.  What about--

                         PLATO
            Children?  Well, we really don't
            encourage them.  They're so noisy
            and troublesome, don't you agree?

                         JUDY
            Yes.  And so terribly annoying when
            they cry.  I just don't know what
            to do when they cry, do you dear?

                         JIM
            Of course.  Drown them like puppies.

                         JUDY
            See, we're very modern.

                         PLATO
            Shall I show you the nursery?  It's
            far away from the rest of the house.
            If you have children--Oh I hate the
            word!--or if you decide to adopt
            one--they can carry on and you'll
            never even notice.  In fact, if you
            lock them in you never have to see
            them again, much less talk to them.

                         JUDY
            Talk to them!  Heavens!

                         JIM
            Nobody talks to children!  They
            just tell them one thing and mean
            another.

                         PLATO
            It's wonderful that you understand
            so well--and so young too!  You
            know the most wonderful feature
            about the nursery?

                         JIM
            What?

                         PLATO
            There's only one key.

                         JIM
            We'll take it!

                         PLATO
            Come on!

PLATO leads them away from us down the arcade, the candelabra
casting wild shadows on the walls.  They are laughing as
they disappear through the glass doors at the end and their
laughter echoes stonily.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Med. shot.  A street and an alley.  Night seen through the
windshield of a police car.  Its radio is on low.  Two
officers are in the front seat.  One of them drinks coffee
from a container.  Suddenly MOOSE's heap moves past on the
street ahead.  In it are MOOSE, GOON and CRUNCH.

Full shot.  The street as MOOSE's heap continues up the
empty street.  The police car slides out of the alley where
it has been concealed, and follows at a distance.  Its
headlights are off.

Close shot.  CRUNCH, GOON and MOOSE (Process).  They are in
the front seat of MOOSE's heap.

                         MOOSE
            What time is it?

                         CRUNCH
            Hang loose.  We got all night.

                         MOOSE
            That maid saw us.  She could
            identify us too.

                         CRUNCH
            You still want to go home, Moose?

                         MOOSE
            No.

                         CRUNCH
            Then shut your mouth before your
            guts run out!

                         GOON
            What guts?

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Inside glass solarium.  A swimming pool lies at the center.
There is no water in it.  Framing the pool is a flagstone
walk with marble benches spotted here and there.  The great
glass room had once been planted thickly with tropical
foliage.

But now what palms and lianas remain are withered and dead
with lack of care.  At the edge of the pool, near the deep
end, a blanket has been spread and a candelabra burns upon
it.  In its mysterious light our three kids are revealed:
JIM, bouncing precariously at the end of the diving board;
JUDY on the blanket nearby; PLATO on the pool's bottom.  All
three are laughing hysterically when suddenly JIM starts to
lose his balance.

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            Quick!  Fill the pool!

JIM falls in.  PLATO rushes to him.

                         JIM
            Let's see how long we can stay under.

                         PLATO
            Man, you're schizoid!

                         JIM
                   (in another outburst
                   of laughing)
            I'm what?  What?

                         JUDY
            You can't talk underwater!

                         JIM
                   (gargling)
            I bet you hear everything I say!

                         PLATO
                   (gargling)
            Isn't he schizoid?

                         JIM
                   (gargling)
            Hey!  How 'bout that!

They laugh again.  JIM swings up the ladder and goes to JUDY.
PLATO follows.

                         PLATO
            Haven't you noticed your personality
            splitting?

                         JIM
            Not lately.

They all sit on the blanket.

                         JIM
            How do you know so much about this
            junk, Plato?

                         PLATO
            I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I
            only went twice though.  My mother
            said it cost too much, so she went
            to Hawaii instead.

JIM lies back with his head in JUDY's lap.  She strokes his
hair and smiles at him.  PLATO looks away.

                         JIM
            No.  Seriously.  What's your trouble?

PLATO hesitates a moment, then leans back, cuddling between
the two of them.

                         PLATO
            I don't know but whatever it is,
            it's gone now.  I mean I'm happy
            now.  Here.

JIM puts his arm under PLATO's chin.

                         PLATO
            I came here before.

                         JIM
            When was that?

                         PLATO
            When I was here?  When I ran away.
            I used to run away a lot but they
            always took me back.

                         JIM
            Who?

                         PLATO
            Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my
            crib and I'd listen to them fight.

                         JIM
            You remember that far back?  Boy, I
            can't even remember yesterday.

                         JUDY
            Plato, where's your father now?

                         PLATO
            He's dead.  He was a hero in the
            China Sea.
                         JIM
            You told me he's a big wheel in New
            York!

                         PLATO
            I did?  Well, he might as well be
            dead.  What's the difference?

                         JUDY
            It's all right.

                         JIM
            Sure.

PLATO closes his eyes.  JUDY hums a lullaby as she strokes
JIM's lips with a finger.  He snaps at it.  Then he kisses
her hand, looks at her palm.  They whisper.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            You have a long life-line.

She takes his palm and examines it.

                         JUDY
            So have you.

She kisses it, holds her cheek against it.

                         JIM
            Ever been in a place like this before?

                         JUDY
            Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.

                         JIM
            How many rooms do you think there are?

                         JUDY
            I don't know.

                         JIM
            Should we explore?

She looks at PLATO.  JIM shrugs--tests to see if the boy is
awake, but there is no reaction.

Carefully, they crawl to their feet.  JIM supporting PLATO's
head with his hands as they do so.  JIM takes the other
blanket and covers PLATO with it.  JUDY kneels on the other
side and tucks it in.  They look at each other across him
and smile.  Then suddenly JUDY bends down and kisses PLATO's
cheek very softly.  JUDY and JIM rise.
JIM takes a candle from the candelabra and leads JUDY along
the edge of the pool to the glass doors beyond.  Silence
except for their footfalls on the flagstone.  In the
distance we see the doors open and the couple pass through.
When they close again, a sob comes from PLATO.

High angle closeup.  PLATO lying as they left him, but his
eyes are open and he is crying.  Camera booms up as PLATO
throws off the blanket and looks after them.  Camera booms
higher until he is revealed as a small and lonely figure
sitting by himself.  The pool echoes his weeping.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Inside library.  Mansion.  Night.  The door opens slowly and
JIM appears with the candle.  JUDY lingers at the door.  The
flickering light reveals a formerly lavish room, paneled in
oak.  There is a tapestry couch, empty bookcases, some dim
portraits, a leather table and several chairs around a great
stone fireplace.

                         JIM
            Hey!  Will you look at this room!
                   (looks behind him)
            Judy?

She comes forward.  JIM drips wax on the table-top and
sticks the candle on it.  His hand shakes.  JUDY sits on the
couch.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            Want to read any books?  Take your
            pick!
                   (sits beside her)
            Isn't this the craziest?

                         JUDY
            Hi.

                         JIM
            Hi.

He takes her hand.  She looks at him and smiles.

                         JIM
                   (continuing)
            What?

                         JUDY
            Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.
                   (kisses it)
            You're so funny.

                         JIM
            Why?

                         JUDY
            I don't know--you just are.
            Leaving a light for Plato.  That
            was nice.

                         JIM
            Maybe he's scared of the dark.

                         JUDY
            Are you?

JIM snuffs out the candle.  They are left in moonlight.  A
pause.

                         JIM
                   (singing)
            Here we are--
            out of cigarettes--
            Junior's in the nurs'ry--
            See how late it gets--

                         JUDY
            You don't need to do that.

                         JIM
            There's something I should tell
            you, Judy.

                         JUDY
            I know already.  We don't have to
            pretend now.

                         JIM
                   (laughing)
            What a relief!

He leans back, relaxed at last.  She snuggles close to him.

                         JUDY
            Is this what it's like to love
            somebody?

                         JIM
            You disappointed?

                         JUDY
                   (mussing her hair)
            Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and
            you--this is silly.

                         JIM
            What?

                         JUDY
            You smell like baby powder.

                         JIM
            So do you.

                         JUDY
            I never felt so clean before.

                         JIM
            It's not going to be lonely, Judy.
            Not for you and not for me.

                         JUDY
            I love somebody.  All the time I've
            been looking for someone to love me
            and now--I love somebody.  And it's
            so easy.  Why is it easy now?

                         JIM
            It is for me too.

                         JUDY
            I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.

She kisses his lips gently and looks into his face.  He
returns the kiss.  Their arms go around each other.

                         JIM
            I mean it too.

He kisses her again--

Full shot.  Road near Planetarium.  MOOSE's heap crawls up
and turns left.  A moment later, the police car appears and
does likewise--still holding its distance.

Full shot.  The mansion as MOOSE's heap moves past on the
road below.  Suddenly it stops.

Inside MOOSE's heap.  CRUNCH looks off, curious.

                         GOON
            What you stopping for?

                         CRUNCH
            You scam a car up there?

                         MOTHER
            So what?

                         CRUNCH
            Nobody's lived in that hunk of junk
            for five-six years.

He switches on the spotlight.  It illuminates JIM's heap.

                         CRUNCH
            Well, what do you know!  I feel a
            kick coming on!

He turns off all the lights and gets out.  The others follow.

Med. shot.  Police car.  It has halted.  One of the officers
gets out and draws his gun.  The other makes radio contact
in a low voice:

                         OFFICER
            This is Unit 17.  Unit 17.

                         RADIO
            Come in, Unit 17.

                         OFFICER
            We just zeroed three kids in a heap.
            Crest Drive and Observatory.  Looks
            like house-breaking.  Send us some
            help.  They may be armed.  Over.

Close shot.  PLATO asleep on the blanket.  Only a single
candle burns in the candelabra.  The same low whistles heard
earlier come from all around him and rise in volume.
Suddenly his eyes open.  He doesn't move, but he has come
suddenly awake.

Low shot.  PLATO lying in f.g.  Next to his face are a pair
of booted feet.  He looks up.  Camera pans up to show CRUNCH.
He is smiling.  He holds a tire chain in his hand which he
swings.

                         CRUNCH
            Good morning.

Full shot.  The swimming pool.  GOON and MOOSE are behind
CRUNCH.  They too are armed with tire chains.  They all
laugh.  PLATO rolls away from them and runs toward the deep
end of the pool.

                         CRUNCH
            Moose!  Take the steps!  Goon!  The
            other side.

The boys run to their assigned places.  PLATO sees no exit.
He flings himself down the ladder and into the pool.  He
feints this way and that, the boys responding as if they
were fencing.  CRUNCH swings down the ladder and his boots
make a loud report as they hit the pool.  MOOSE advances
down the steps at the shallow end.  GOON climbs onto the
pool bottom at the opposite side.  The feinting continues,
wordlessly, as the circle closes around PLATO.  The only
sounds are the stamping of their boots as they try to
distract him from side to side, and the animalistic grunts
they make to scare him.  Suddenly PLATO sees an opening and
plunges past MOOSE, pushing him over, and stumbles up the
steps.

                         CRUNCH
            Come on!  Let's make it!

They stream out of the pool after PLATO.  He reaches the
glass doors first, streaks though, and bangs them shut
behind him.

Traveling shot.  Arcade.  PLATO's face is visible only when
the moonlight strikes him through the passing windows.  The
sound of running steps behind him.

Full shot.  Main room.  A pattern of moonlight on the bare
floor as PLATO dashes in and through it.  He falls over a
piece of furniture and comes scurrying in to camera, wheels
around on hands and knees to face the door.  The boys plunge
into the moonlit square and stop.  PLATO tries not to
breathe.  A match is struck.  CRUNCH looks around, but can
see nothing.  That match goes out.  The boys start up the
stairs, whispering.  Immediately, PLATO crawls forward,
under the piano.  He hears a murmur of voices from behind
the oak door of the library--next to the piano.  He moves to
it stealthily.

Close shot, PLATO at door listening through it, on hands and
knees.  His confusion mounts.  He shakes his head to clear
it.  Then, suddenly he rises and tries the knob.  The door
is locked.  He beats on it.

                         PLATO
            Save me!

The boys run across the room.  As they hit the moonlit
square.  PLATO spins and fires.  Somebody drops and starts
moaning.  JIM opens the door.

                         PLATO
                   (shrieks)
            What you run out on me for!  What
            you leave me alone for?

                         JIM
            Plato!

There is a rush of boys coming forward.

                         PLATO
                   (with hate)
            I don't want you for my father!

                         JIM
            Your father!

PLATO fires at JIM.  JIM leaps at PLATO with a cry and
knocks him down.

                         JIM
                   (in rage)
            You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!

                         PLATO
                   (screaming)
            Get away from me!

He rolls away from JIM and runs to the main door.

                         JUDY
            Jim!

Main door, from inside.  PLATO falls upon it, fumbles with
the bolt and swings the door wide.  He steps out into the
waning moonlight and we see him running down the lawn.  JIM
rushes into the doorway and stops short.

Full shot.  Mansion.  The OFFICERS are moving away from us
toward it.  PLATO runs wildly toward them.

                         OFFICER
                   (sharply)
            Halt!

PLATO stops, confused.

                         OFFICER
                   (continuing)
            Come here.

JIM runs out on the promenade and starts over the balustrade.

                         JIM
            Plato!

Close shot.  PLATO.  His face is working desperately in
growing panic.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Come here, son.

                         PLATO
            No!

                         JIM (O.S.)
            Plato!

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Just walk over here quietly now--
            and there won't be any trouble.

PLATO runs out.

Close shot.  JIM as he screams.

                         JIM
            Plato!

Full shot.  Main doorway as JUDY rushes out, followed by
GOON and MOOSE.  They all stop dead at the balustrade.

                         JUDY
            Jim!  Watch out!

Reverse shot.  Lawn.  JIM seen in f.g.  PLATO bolting toward
the woods in the direction of the planetarium.  The officers
have both hit the ground in the distance.  They fire again.
JIM hesitates a moment, then rushes after PLATO.  The
officers fire again.

Moving shot.  JIM as he runs after PLATO.

Med. shot.  OFFICERS as they rise to their feet.

                         FIRST OFFICER
            Take the house!  I'll head him off.

Full shot.  Front of mansion.  JUDY flies down the stairs
and rushes past camera.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Halt!  Halt!

Prowl car.  Another part of town (Process).  RAY is driving.
JIM's father is beside him.  The mother is in the back seat.

                   (turning to JIM's parents)
            There are some kids in trouble--
            you'll have to go with me.

                         FATHER
            Perfectly all right.

Edge of woods as JIM hurtles in from the open ground beyond.
He stumbles against a tree and sinks down.

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            Plato!

Traveling shot in the woods as PLATO rushes through the
moonlit trees, sobbing.

                         JIM (O.S.)
                   (distant)
            Plato!

Med. shot.  JIM at the base of a tree.  He is whimpering,
shaking his head.  JUDY crashes through the brush and drops
beside him.

                         JUDY
            Did he hit you?

She is on the verge of hysteria.

                         JIM
            No!

                         JUDY
            We have to go back!

                         JIM
            No!  I got to find him.

He starts to rise.

                         JUDY
            After he tried to shoot you?

                         JIM
            He didn't mean it--we shouldn't
            have left him.  He needed us.

                         JUDY
            He needed you, maybe.  So do I.

There is a sound of distant gunfire.  Both kids freeze.

                         JIM
            He needs you too.  Come on.

JUDY, breaking into a run, follows after him through the brush.

                         JUDY
            You should have heard him talk
            about you tonight.  Like you were
            the hero in the China Seas.

                         JIM
            Sure.  He was trying to make us his
            family.

                         JUDY
            They're killing him!

JIM runs ahead blindly and disappears in the trees.  JUDY
rushes after him a few steps, then stops.

JUDY and JIM running.

PLATO running.

The planetarium.  Moonlight.  Shooting from the bridle path
and panning to the building.  PLATO reels in and goes to the
front door.

Med. shot.  Door to planetarium.  PLATO clutches the handle.
The door is locked.  He whimpers once in frustration.

Med. shot.  Policeman running up same path PLATO has followed.

PLATO at door to planetarium.  He smashes the glass with his
gun and dives through.

Inside planetarium as PLATO lands.  He is cut and bleeding.

                         OFFICER (O.S.)
            Come out of there.

PLATO wheels and skitters backward across the floor of the
observatory on his hands and knees until he comes to the
door of the planetarium theater.

Reverse shot.  Main entrance.  Seen from inside.  The
OFFICER in b.g., PLATO in f.g.  The OFFICER appears in the
entrance, then moves quickly to one side to be less of a
target.  He reaches in to unlatch the door.

                         OFFICER
            You're making it tough on yourself,
            kid.  Come out quietly now.  You
            didn't kill anybody yet.

PLATO fires at him, then opens the door of the planetarium
theater and runs inside.  The door swings shut behind him.

Outside planetarium.  The OFFICER is hugging the outside
wall.  Another siren wails and a spotlight catches the
OFFICER who runs out into the light.

                         OFFICER
                   (running)
            Need a little help here!

Full shot.  Parking lot as the CHIEF's car wheels to a stop.
It is followed by a civilian car and a cab.

CHIEF's car.

                         CHIEF
            We heard firing.  He get anybody?
            You alone?

                         OFFICER
            We got a cookaboo inside.  He
            wounded some kid earlier.

                         CHIEF
            How'd he get in?

                         OFFICER
            Smashed the front door.

                         CHIEF
            Any other entrance?

                         OFFICER
                   (leaving)
            Down in back.

Med. shot.  Bushes bordering planetarium as JIM climbs
through them and stops short, staring in amazement.  JUDY is
in b.g.

Full shot.  Parking lot.  JIM seen in f.g. hiding in the
screen of leaves.  Beyond we see the full activity--the
crowd, the cars, searchlights playing on the planetarium
entrance, police moving in under direction of the CHIEF.

                         CHIEF
                   (loud on speaker)
            Silence.  Please maintain silence.
            Keep back and stay off the
            pavements.  Keep back and stay off
            the pavements.  There will be
            emergency vehicles coming through.
            This warning is for your own
            protection.

RAY's prowl car come in.  JIM's parents climb out, curious.
RAY hurries to consult with an officer who briefs him, then
hurries to the chief's car.

Parking lot.  Several patrol cars now line the parking lot.
The NEGRO WOMAN in her nightgown and overcoat pushes forward
from a cab and accosts an OFFICER.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            What's going on?

                         OFFICER
            I don't know, lady.  Some kid's in
            trouble.  Stand back, please.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
            I got to know.  My boy run off
            tonight.  He had a gun with him, too.

Med. shot.  CHIEF's car as RAY hurries in.

                         CHIEF
            Hello, Ray--Know anything about this?

                         RAY
            As much as you do--Loan me your
            mike, will you?

                         CHIEF
                   (handing it to him)
            Help yourself.

                         RAY
                   (into mike)
            I am addressing the boy in the
            planetarium.  I am speaking to the
            boy inside.  This is Ray Framek
            from the Juvenile Division--

Close-up JIM as he reacts to RAY's name.  He rises and looks
off.

                         RAY (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            You are now surrounded.  You are
            surrounded by many armed police.
            Whoever you are, drop your weapon
            and come outside.

Med. shot.  JIM'S FATHER standing by RAY's car, gazing off
with interest.  His wife comes out and stands beside him,
looks at him questioningly.

                         RAY (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            Come outside.  Clasp your hands
            over your head and come outside
            quietly--

The FATHER's gaze has traveled over the scene.  Suddenly he
sees his son followed by JUDY, run into the planetarium.

                         MOTHER
            Frank!

                         FATHER
            Stay here.
                   (goes over to RAY)
            That was my son!

                         RAY
            You sure?

                         FATHER
            I think I know my son.

The FATHER moves behind the crowd, camera trucking with him,
until he reaches the bushes at the edge of the parking lot
and stops, gathering himself.  Meanwhile RAY's voice
continues over:

                         RAY (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            Jim Stark!  I'm addressing Jim
            Stark.  Nobody will harm you or
            your friends if you follow these
            instructions.  We are here to
            protect you.  Drop your guns and
            come outside.  Nobody will hurt you
            if you do as I say--

The FATHER starts forward along the bushes as if stalking
game.  Each step is carefully placed and quiet, but his
heart tugs him along like a kite dragging an anchor.

                         CHIEF
            Officers!  Another boy and girl
            just ran into the planetarium.  We
            do not know if they are armed.
            Hold your positions until further
            instruction.

Inside planetarium as JIM comes dashing in, spins around,
staring.  JUDY follows.  A siren is heard outside growing
shrill.

                         CHIEF (O.S.)
                   (over speaker)
            Ambulance.  Ambulance is coming
            through.  Clear a passage.  Will
            you people make way there?

Floodlights strike the door and illuminate the lobby dimly.

                         JIM
                   (softly)
            Plato?

Silence.  JIM moves cautiously to the door of the planetarium
theater.  JUDY hangs back.  Another siren is heard
approaching.  More floodlights strike the door.

                         JIM
                   (continuing - calling softly)
            Plato?  Plato, you in there?
                   (silence)
            Hey, I'm going to open the door now.
            You'll be able to see me and you
            can shoot me if you want, but just
            remember one thing, Plato--You're
            my friend.  That means a lot to me.

JIM opens the door slowly.

Inside theater.  Darkness except for the splash of light
from the door where JIM stands in silhouette.  He lets the
door close.  Blackness.

                         JIM
            Plato?

                         PLATO
            I'm here.

                         JIM
            Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a
            match?  I'm going to break my neck
            in here.  Where are you?

                         PLATO
            I've got a gun.

                         JIM
            I know.  Light a match, will you?

PLATO obeys.

                         JIM
            That's swell.  How are you?

                         PLATO
            I'm fine.

Another siren is heard outside.  JIM has reached the
lecturer's desk and, just as the match goes out, he throws a
switch.  The stars appear on the dome and the projector
starts its slow revolution.

                         PLATO
            You think the end of the world will
            come at nighttime, Jim?

                         JIM
            No.  At dawn.

                         PLATO
            Why?

                         JIM
            I just have a feeling.  Where are you?

                         PLATO
            Here.

                         JIM
            Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I
            can't talk to you if I don't see you.

JIM waits.  Nothing happens.

                         JIM
            Hey, look at the stars, Plato.
            Stand up and look at the stars.

Plato rises from behind a row, then JIM continues:

                         JIM
            That's fine.

JIM approaches slowly.

                         JIM
            I'm not going to hurt you.
                         PLATO
            Why did you run out on me?

                         JIM
            We didn't run out.  We were coming
            right back.

                         PLATO
            You sure?

                         JIM
            Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting.
            You ready to come out now?

A siren is heard.

                         PLATO
            No.

                         JIM
            I promise nothing'll happen if you
            do.
                   (silence)
            You want my jacket?  It's warm.

JIM takes off his jacket and holds it out to PLATO.

                         PLATO
            Can I keep it?

                         JIM
            What do you think?

JIM gives him the jacket--PLATO puts it on.

                         JIM
            You want to give me your gun now,
            Plato?

                         PLATO
            My gun?

                         JIM
            In your pocket.  Give it to me.

                         PLATO
            I need it.

                         JIM
            You trust me, don't you?  Just give
            it to me for a second.

PLATO hands him the gun.  JIM removes the cartridges and
puts them in his pocket.

                         PLATO
            You promised to give it back.

                         JIM
            Friends never break promises, do
            they?
                   (gives him back the gun)
            Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There
            are a lot of people outside and
            they all want you to be safe.  You
            understand that?  They said I could
            come in and bring you out.

                         PLATO
            Why?

                         JIM
            They like you.  Okay?

                         PLATO
            Come on!

JIM opens the door for PLATO, then follows him out.  JUDY
joins them.

                         JUDY
            Hi, Plato!

                         PLATO
            Hi.

Observatory as JIM, JUDY and PLATO come to the entrance.
PLATO sees an OFFICER.

                         PLATO
            Who's that?

                         JIM
            Just a guard.

                         PLATO
            I shot at one of them.

                         JIM
            But you didn't hurt anybody.

Outside observatory as PLATO and JIM come forward into the
early dawn.  PLATO stops and looks off, scared.

Slow pan shot.  The crowd.  It has grown enormously.
Silence.  There are armed officers everywhere--all waiting,
alert.

Med. shot.  NEGRO WOMAN.  Her eyes are moist.  Her lips move
in silent prayer.

Med. shot.  JIM's parents.  The FATHER looking on anxiously.
The MOTHER is crying against the car.

Med. shot.  JIM and PLATO.

                         PLATO
            Those aren't my friends.  Make them
            go away.

                         JIM
                   (tense; calling past camera)
            Ray!  Will you tell these guys to
            move back?

Suddenly PLATO bolts.  JIM wheels after him.

                         JIM
                   (yelling)
            Plato!  Don't be a fool!

Full shot.  Planetarium as PLATO dashes to the stairway
leading to the balcony.

JIM'S FATHER and MOTHER.  Their faces reflect panic as they
see PLATO running in JIM's coat.

                         MOTHER
            It's Jim!

Full shot.  Balcony.  Shooting down the stairs as PLATO
rushes up.  JIM closes behind him.  Camera pans with PLATO
as he climbs the ladder to the ledge of the small dome.  JIM
stops at the foot of the ladder.

                         JIM
            Plato!

                         PLATO
            Keep away from me!  I don't believe
            you anymore!

He raises the gun as if to shoot JIM.  An OFFICER drops to
one knee and fires a shot at PLATO.

Full shot.  Small dome.  PLATO drops like a stone to JIM's
feet.

Close-up.  JIM.

                         JIM
                   (screaming--wildly)
            But I've got the bullets!  The gun
            was empty!

Close shot.  NEGRO WOMAN as she screams, a handkerchief in
her mouth.

Close shot.  JUDY.  She sobs once and runs up steps.

Med. shot.  JIM staring down at PLATO.

                         JIM
            Plato?
                   (crouches over PLATO)
            Plato.  Hey, Jerkpot!

There is nothing.  He rises and faces the crowd, shaking his
head in wonder and reproach.

                         JIM
                   (quiet)
            What did you have to do that for?

Full shot, the roof.  Parents and Officers.  The NEGRO WOMAN
is hysterical.  RAY shoves past her, followed by JIM'S
FATHER and MOTHER.  They rush toward camera.

Ambulance crew.  They spring into action, arrive with
stretcher.

The balcony.  JIM is at PLATO's side.  A couple of OFFICERS
rush forward to take JIM.  The FATHER comes in and pushes
them aside.

                         FATHER
            Let him alone!  He's mine!  I'll
            take care of him!

RAY, who has witnessed this, motions to the officers.

                         RAY
            It's all right!  It's all right!

The FATHER stares down at JIM for a moment.  Then he kneels
beside his son, puts his coat over JIM's shoulders.  He
speaks very gently.

                         FATHER
            For a minute...that jacket...I
            thought...
                   (breaks off, then)
            You couldn't help it, son.
                   (reaches out, gently,
                   but firmly)
            You did everything a man could do.

He takes JIM by the elbow and starts to bring him to his
feet.  The boy suddenly resists, and remains kneeling.

                         FATHER
            Stand up, Jim.  I'll stand up with
            you.  Let me try to be as strong as
            you want me to be.

A faint hope appears in the boy's face.  He no longer
resists as the FATHER helps him to rise.  But he still keeps
his back to him.  The ambulance attendants start putting
PLATO on a stretcher.  JIM moves, as if to stop them, but
the FATHER still holds his shoulders.

                         JIM
            He depended on me.

                         FATHER
            And you can depend on me, son.
            Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll
            face it together, I swear.

JIM feels, for the first time, the love and security he has
always wanted.  He clutches at his FATHER, crying unashamedly.
The FATHER's arms envelop him.  PLATO, through his death,
has helped these two find each other.

Close shot.  JUDY and RAY watching.

Low angle.  NEGRO WOMAN as she bends over PLATO's body.

                         NEGRO WOMAN
                   (as they lift PLATO
                   onto litter)
            This poor baby got nobody.  Just
            nobody.

As he is carried past her, she follows.

Balcony stairs.  From below as JIM, supported by his FATHER,
comes down.  RAY is behind them.  They pause for a silent
meeting with the MOTHER at foot of the stairs.  She kisses
JIM and starts wiping his tears away, but he is weeping
soundlessly and it does no good.

JIM looks back up at the dome.  The ambulance attendants are
bearing PLATO's litter down the last few stairs, followed by
the NEGRO WOMAN.

Group.  The ambulance attendants come down the last few
stairs followed by the NEGRO WOMAN.  JIM steps forward
suddenly and adjusts the blanket covering PLATO.  JUDY comes
to JIM's side.  The litter passes camera and we hold on two
shot of JIM and JUDY, seen against the lightening sky.

                         JIM
                   (to JUDY, half to himself)
            He was always cold.

JUDY moves to JIM and touches his arm lightly.  He looks
down at her.

Med. shot.  The group.  JIM's arm is around JUDY as he leads
her, firmly, towards his MOTHER and FATHER.  His voice is
warm, brimming with the new found pride he takes in his
parents as he introduces JUDY to them.

                         JIM
            Mom--Dad--this is my friend.  Her
            name is Judy.

The parents nods warmly and smile at her.  She smiles shyly
in response, happy at being accepted.  There is a warmth
emanating from the tight little group.  Changes have
happened to them.  Old things have been shed and a new start
has been made.  Camera booms--pulls back high to:

High general shot.  Planetarium, JIM and JUDY, FATHER and
MOTHER threading their way through the crowd as the camera
continues to pull back.

                                            FADE OUT.

                          The end.

               FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT

               lies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the 
               body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The 
               white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.

               REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT

               The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling 
               winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead 
               in the doorway.

               It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. 
               His face is missing.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third 
               BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of 
               an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed 
               through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.

               A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang 
               off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.

               INT. ROOM - NIGHT

               A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of 
               neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. 
               The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.

               EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT

               where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, 
               which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously 
               atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.

               His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, 
               late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.

               He opens his eyes.

                                     RUDY (V.O.)
                         I never was much for the holidays.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND

               rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."

               And then, to complete the sentence: "...XMAS."

               FADE IN:

               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY

               Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the 
               Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.

               INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

               Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- 
               where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.

               The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo 
               through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across 
               the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.

               He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage 
               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family 
               photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful 
               Dodger.

               A WALL CALENDAR

               Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.

               December 22nd is circled again and again.

               Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops 
               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. 
               Turning back to the beds we reveal --

               THE LOWER BUNK

               where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached 
               and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is 
               a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost 
               a mural.

               All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, 
               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous 
               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.

               RUDY

               stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, 
               turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen 
               this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

               The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick 
               absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.

                                     NICK
                         What's the first thing, man? What's 
                         the first thing you're gonna do?

                                     RUDY
                         Haven't thought about it.

                                     NICK
                         Hell you haven't.

                                     RUDY
                         Get to thinking about it, it won't 
                         happen.

                                     NICK
                         We walk outta here, we hit that road, 
                         what's the first thing you're gonna 
                         do.

                                     RUDY
                         Ain't there yet.

                                     NICK
                         Three days, man.

                         Not yet.

                                     NICK
                         Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, 
                         Christmas on the outs.

               Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, 
               hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his 
               cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.

                                     RUDY
                         Hot chocolate.

                                     NICK
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         Get a hot mug of chocolate.
                              (nods)
                         First thing I'm gonna do.

                                     NICK
                              (smiles)
                         And a slice of pecan pie, right?

                                     RUDY
                         And some pecan pie.

               Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the 
               prison's entrance road. Longingly.

                                     NICK
                         She's gonna be out there, man. Right 
                         there. Right there waiting.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                         Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and 
                         right into her arms.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                         Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing 
                         her own damn sheets, you read that 
                         part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves 
                         in the whole week, drinking wine, 
                         taking baths, man, see if they got 
                         those room service steaks... anything 
                         I want to do. Remember when she wrote 
                         that? Anything I want...

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

               Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but 
               the time they get outside is too precious to give up.

                                     RUDY
                         All those pictures she's sent... 
                         y'know... you sure they're all of 
                         her, Nick? You hear sometimes they 
                         don't send their real pictures. Could 
                         be her cousin or something.

               Nick studies him.

                                     NICK
                         Why you gotta say a thing like that.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm just saying.

                                     NICK
                         Why you gotta. We were gonna give 
                         you a ride someplace, man. Now I 
                         just don't know.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm just talking.

                                     NICK
                         Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.

               They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road 
               again. A snowy wasteland.

               Rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.

                                     RUDY
                         For twenty-five, she sounds pretty 
                         mature.

                         get matured real quick.

               Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, 
               reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the 
               same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.

               Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling 
               at the latest letter.

                                     RUDY
                         What if she sees you, man, sees what 
                         you look like... and it's not there.  
                         You just don't do it for her.

                                     NICK
                         Me and her got a connection.
                              (hands page to him)
                         Read this part. Read the part about 
                         stuffing her stocking.

               Nick drops the page on his stomach. Rudy sighs, picks it up, 
               brings it to his nose.

                                     RUDY
                         She's using a new perfume.

                                     NICK
                         No, I think that's just oranges. She 
                         writes here she's eating oranges.

                                     RUDY
                         Oh.

                                     NICK
                         Shoulda written to that magazine, 
                         Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, 
                         walk right into a relationship. Not 
                         some one-nighter, man... a 
                         relationship. You? You're gonna walk 
                         outta here with bus fare. Searching 
                         for the drunkest skirt in the room.

                                     RUDY
                         Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?

                                     NICK
                         Shoulda written, Rudy...

               Nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo 
               among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:

                                     NICK
                         Shoulda got yourself a girl.

               Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick 
               marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his 
               eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, 
                         and sit down for Christmas dinner. 
                         Watch some ball with my old man, 
                         sleep in my old bed, and have 
                         leftovers for bout six months.

                                     NICK
                         Thought you hated Sidnaw.

                                     RUDY
                         Just taste that Christmas turkey.

                                     NICK
                         Thought you hate your old man.

                                     RUDY
                         Five years, Nicky. Five years.
                              (shrugs)
                         I just want to go home.

               There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING. 
               Nick smiles, still staring at his girl.

                                     NICK
                         Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be 
                         thinking about you.

               INT. MAIN PRISON FLOOR - DAY

               GUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for 
               the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN 
               GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the 
               line.

                                     RUDY
                         Shit. Alamo's back.

               Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed 
               Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands 
               are the size of a man's skull.

                                     NICK
                         Don't look like he missed the 
                         sunlight.

                                     RUDY
                         Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm 
                         the one ratted on him beating up 
                         Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, 
                         he thinks I got him sent to solitary.

                                     NICK
                         Aw, Rudy.

               At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy 
               swiftly looks away --

                                     RUDY
                         Count me outta mealtime --

               He slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell --

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         GET BACK IN LINE!

                                     RUDY
                         I'm not hungry, I'm gonna --

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET 
                         BACK IN FUCKING LINE!

               The mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready 
               behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble.

               Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks 
               across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy 
               swallows, heads toward the mess hall.

               INT. MESS HALL - DAY

               A GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed 
               on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line.

                                     NICK
                         What the fuck is this?

                                     UGLY STAFFER
                         Holiday jello.

                                     NICK
                         What's this shit in it?

                                     UGLY STAFFER
                         Swallow and see.

               The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick 
               looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help:

                                     NICK
                         Just so you know, this man and I are 
                         outta here in two days. So while 
                         we're inhaling London broil and 
                         lobster bisque, you're gonna still 
                         be standing here smelling up the 
                         mystery creamfuck.
                              (nods)
                         Who's in prison now?

               The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, 
               taking his tray off the rail and turning --

               -- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into 
               the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to 
               see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over.

                                     THE ALAMO
                         When you don't expect it.

                                     RUDY
                         It wasn't me, Alamo --

                                     THE ALAMO
                         That's when.

               The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes 
               a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. 
               They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help:

                                     NICK
                         Two days.

               INT. MESS HALL - TABLES - DAY

               Rudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a 
               frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks 
               to no one, always has the shakes.

                                     NICK
                         So maybe after our week beneath the 
                         sheets, we'll head down to Motor 
                         City for New Year's. She says her 
                         roommate's skipping town for a few 
                         days, have the place to ourselves.  
                         Remember how her brother's a truck 
                         driver down there? I'm thinking he 
                         might be able to help get me some 
                         work.

                                     RUDY
                         What, working security?

                                     NICK
                         No, I'm through with that shit. 
                         Ashley's right. Gotta start doing 
                         something I got a stake in. Get a 
                         business going.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know, I've seen the business 
                         world.

                                     NICK
                         Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify 
                         as a small business. Chop shop 
                         consultant; doesn't work on a resume.

               Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts 
               of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned.

                                     NICK
                         Ashley's talking about maybe we can 
                         start something up together...

               Next to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone, 
               staring at his tray.

                                     NICK
                         Whatsa matter, Zook?

               They both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into 
               his red-and-green jello with his bare hand.

                                     RUDY
                         The hell you doing, Zookerman?

               Gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a 
               large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking.

                                     NICK
                         Just a roach, Zook.

                                     RUDY
                         Good for you. Protein.

                                     ZOOK
                         Monsters in the gelatin...

                                     NICK
                         It's a roach, guy --

                                     ZOOK
                         There are monsters...
                              (voice rising)
                         ...in the gelatin...

                                     NICK
                         Oh, man --

               Zook stands up, holding jello aloft:

                                     ZOOK
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!

                                     NICK
                              (shakes his head)
                         Fuckin, Zookerman --

                                     ZOOK
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!  
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

               A GRUMBLING MURMUR sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates 
               sift through their jello, searching for --

                                     DISTANT INMATE
                         Sonofabitch!

               He pulls something bug-like out of his dessert, holds it 
               aloft, and then HURLS it at the cafeteria line. A STAFFER 
               ducks away. The inmates LAUGH and suddenly they're all on 
               their feet --

                                     ZOOK
                         THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!

               -- grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria 
               line. Inmates get errantly SPLASHED, and respond by wheeling 
               on their fellow inmates -- red and green globs flying to and 
               fro!

                                     GUARDS
                         SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN!

               As GUARDS immediately rush in to restore order --

                                     NICK
                         Rudy, don't move --

                                     RUDY
                         Two days, we got two days! Don't do 
                         nothing. Don't touch nothing --

               An INMATE at the end of their table picks up their table and 
               overturns it, sending food flying. Rudy and Nick stand back, 
               hands raised in surrender. Jello HITS Rudy in the face.

                                     NICK
                         Don't move, Rudy!

                                     RUDY
                         Standing right here, man!

               Zook is still SHOUTING until a GUARD clubs him senseless 
               with a blackjack. WHISTLES are blowing. Guards SCREAM for 
               order.

                                     NICK
                              (as a GUARD eyes them)
                         Ate the jello, jello was fine!

               The guard leaves them alone, runs on. The melee's still out 
               of control. As Rudy turns --

               -- and suddenly sees The Alamo charging across the room, 
               with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! Five feet 
               away!

                                     NICK
                         RUDY, LOOK OUT!

               Nick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way --

               -- and The Alamo's shank plunges deep into Nick's stomach 
               burying between his ribs. Blood splashes. Nick slumps.

                                     RUDY
                         NICK!

               The Alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious YELL, pushes 
               Nick to the floor and spins on Rudy! Rudy blocks with a chair, 
               stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as The Alamo roars 
               over him for the kill --

               -- and two GUARDS tackle the big Indian out of nowhere! 
               Knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. It 
               takes another three guards to keep The Alamo down.

               Rudy scrambles across the floor. Nick's on his back, blood 
               pumping freely from his gut --

                                     RUDY
                         GUARD! GUARD!

                                     NICK
                              (in shock)

                         GUARD!!!

               No one's helping, the guards nearby all subduing The Alamo. 
               Nick grabs Rudy's shirt, gasping to speak --

                                     NICK
                         Jesus, Rudy --

                         Hold it in! GUARD!

                                     NICK
                         Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...

                                     RUDY

                                     RUDY
                         No, man! No, no, no!

                                     NICK

                                     RUDY
                         You're GONNA be there! We're getting 
                         outta here! TAKE IT!

                                     NICK
                         Tell Ashley... I...

                                     RUDY
                         YOU TELL HER!

                                     NICK
                         ...be with her...

               Blood spills out Nick's mouth. His eyes go vacant.

                                     RUDY
                         NO!!!

                                     NICK
                         ...for Christmas...

                                     RUDY
                         NICK!!!

               And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS 
               descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging 
               his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing.

                                     GUARDS
                         GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!

                                     RUDY
                         NICK!!!

               Rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the 
               skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor.

               And the world goes dark.

               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

               Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his 
               head. The cell block silent for the first time.

               Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's 
               somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with 
               distinct pleasure.

                                     RUDY
                         The man had two days...

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         Well. Least he won't be coming back.

               The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him --

               -- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing 
               through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps 
               the cruel smile.

                                     MEAN GUARD
                         You need company tonight, Rudy... 
                         you just give a holler.

               He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You 
               Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he 
               shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the 
               row.

               RUDY

               turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on 
               Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind.

               THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY

               Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the 
               photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall.

               RUDY

               takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of 
               it.

               Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters.

               He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. 
               He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it.

                                     NICK (V.O.)
                         Rudy, man, here we go, here, what 
                         she wrote here: "The car's waiting. 
                         The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.  
                         I've waited for so long. I'm burning 
                         for you, Nick. My whole body. My 
                         whole heart. I'm burning for you..."

               Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a 
               swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly.

                                     RUDY
                         He was burning for you too...

               And puts the letter away.

               CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT

               As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY

               Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door 
               BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, 
               make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered 
               in snow.

                                     EXIT GUARD
                         Your world and welcome to it, 
                         dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! 
                         We'll keep the lights on for ya!

               Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill 
               hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in 
               summer.

               Secondhand shoes. No possessions.

               He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All 
               fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the 
               fenceway.

               BEYOND THE GATE

               There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, 
               several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats 
               and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.

               The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks 
               the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.

               The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives 
               rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade 
               slaps on backs. Reunion time.

               The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head 
               down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he 
               can't help himself -- he glances up --

               TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN

               bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball 
               on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.

               RUDY

               drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.

               INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

               Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes 
               a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. 
               Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.

               Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into 
               his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the 
               picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.

               He rubs his window with his sleeve.

               Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and 
               that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing 
               onto the bus with their loved ones.

               The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the 
               gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.

               Rudy watches her sadly.

               Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up 
               their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, 
               buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's 
               changed.

               The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.

               Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.

               Then at the shivering bundle.

                                     RUDY
                         Don't do it, Rudy...

               The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON 
               makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his 
               leg.

               Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. 
               Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy 
               looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         Don't do it ...

               The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs 
               with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.

               EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS

               The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy 
               road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.

               The door opens. And Rudy steps out.

               The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.

               The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We 
               get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips 
               turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's 
               Ashley.

               She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow 
               obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them 
               shivering. Both of them standing there.

               And finally:

                                     RUDY
                         You Ashley?

               Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm Nick.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

               Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on. 
               Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.

               Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.

               She's watching him in silence.

                                     RUDY
                         I like your coat.

               Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own:

                                     RUDY
                         This -- this is just something they 
                         gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing 
                         when we signed up, y'know?

               Ashley nods.

                                     RUDY
                         How's your coffee?

               Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. 
               She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Good.

               Rudy nods. Silence again.

                                     RUDY
                         Gotta be ten degrees out there.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Radio said negative five.

                                     RUDY
                         Negative five?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yeah.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't think it's negative five.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Radio said.

               Beat.

                                     RUDY
                         Wind chill. That's probably what 
                         they meant.

               Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip.

                                     RUDY
                         I was scared. Scared you were gonna 
                         take one look at me and change your 
                         mind. Scared I was walking into 
                         heartache. All those words... you 
                         put a picture in your mind of where 
                         they come from and when you see where 
                         maybe it's not the same as your 
                         picture.

               He trails off.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I figured you walked outta there and 
                         saw me and walked right the other 
                         way --

                                     RUDY
                         No, no --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Saw my outfit or something, my coat --

                                     RUDY
                         No, hey, I like your coat --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Saw me --

                                     RUDY
                         Ashley, no. That was me, that's what 
                         I was scared of. I mean, be serious...  
                         I ain't exactly looking like Mr.  
                         Universe here.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You are to me.

               Rudy goes silent. Whoa. Ashley considers.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Thought you wrote you had a mustache.

                                     RUDY
                         I can get another one going. Y'know, 
                         hey, whatever you want me to --

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, no, no. Be like you want to be.

               Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside 
               the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white 
               mustache. He stares straight-faced.

               Ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.

                                     RUDY
                         Do that again.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What.

                                     RUDY
                         Smile.

               Ashley smiles again, blushing now.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No --

                                     RUDY
                         One more. Smile. One more.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (trying not to)
                         No, c'mon --

                                     RUDY
                         I've been dreaming about that smile, 
                         Ashley Mercer. For a long time.

               They stare across the table, drifting into one another's 
               eyes.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You're better than the picture in my 
                         mind, Nick...
                              (softly)
                         You're real.

               Outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. INTERSTATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               And Rudy and Ashley SLAM inside, kissing passionately, limbs 
               intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. Rudy kicks the 
               door closed. Mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair.

               They collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling 
               onto the lumpy bed. Rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater 
               and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on, 
               as Ashley's lips explore his neck and body. Writhing and 
               wrestling and rolling off the bed. Bang.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Rudy and Ashley fuck like lovers in R-rated movies.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - LATER

               The bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. Rudy and Ashley 
               rest naked amidst them. Her pretty young head on his chest, 
               all their inhibitions gone. Rudy strokes her arms.

                                     RUDY
                         Tell me something. This the first 
                         time you've ever done this?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that 
                         supposed to mean --

                                     RUDY
                         No, not that, no...
                              (laughs, kisses her)
                         I mean this, the whole thing. Start 
                         writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. 
                         Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me 
                         the truth.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Well. You're not the first guy I 
                         wrote to. But you're the only one I 
                         kept writing to.

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah. Me too.
                              (considers)
                         Why? I mean I know why for me, why I 
                         paid for the ad. But you... why start 
                         writing to some guy -- some con -- 
                         you don't even know?

               Ashley studies his face, smiles in reflection.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I told you, Nick. Remember?

                                     RUDY
                         Tell me again.

                                     ASHLEY
                         All the guys I've ever been with... 
                         they never want to know me. Who I am 
                         on the inside. They just want to qet 
                         inside. When they do, they think 
                         that means they know who I am. That 
                         I trust them. That they know me. 
                         That there's nothing left to learn.
                              (beat)
                         A guy like you, Nick -- six months 
                         before you can even touch my face. I 
                         figure a guy in that kind of bind, 
                         he's gonna hafta work to get to know 
                         me some other way.

                                     RUDY
                         Had some bad relationships, didn't 
                         you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Not bad. Just regular.
                              (smiles)
                         You wrote me wonderful things, Nick.  
                         Personal things.

               She turns to him, kisses his chest --

                                     RUDY
                         Well, wasn't all me, y'know.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yes it was all you --

                                     RUDY
                         Guy I was in with... he helped 
                         sometimes... some of the romantic 
                         stuff, actually... you'd like him --

                                     ASHLEY
                         I'm talking about the heart, Nick. 
                         I'm not talking about the words.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know, some of the heart mighta 
                         been his too...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Then he shoulda signed his name.

               She turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. Ready 
               to make up for lost time. With a kiss:

                                     ASHLEY
                         And he'd be here right now.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Ashley runs through an Xmas-decorated megamall, dragging 
               Rudy behind her. Both of them laughing, as she hauls him 
               over to some cookie bakery company:

                                     RUDY
                         Where the hell are you going?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Provisions! We are not leaving that 
                         motel room again till after New 
                         Year's: we need ten days worth of 
                         provisions!
                              (to cookie matron)
                         What's good?!

                                     COOKIE MATRON
                         Oh my, we've got a special on our 
                         chocolate crunchie elves, they're 
                         shaped like little helpers --

                                     ASHLEY
                         THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in 
                         two goddamn years! Get him two of 
                         everything!

                                     RUDY
                         Ashley, Jesus --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Can't survive on our bodies alone, 
                         Nick.
                              (to cookie matron)
                         Hurry up!

                                     RUDY
                         Ash... didn't you write me that you 
                         don't eat chocolate?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yeah, well you wrote me you were six-
                         foot-four, baby.
                              (teasing smile)
                         So don't talk to me about little 
                         white lies.

               INT. J.C. PENNEY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

               Teddy bears with nightcaps, green bows, red ribbons. Ashley's 
               tearing through men's clothing racks, all love and confidence.

               Rudy's got a bunch of purchase bags weighing him down:

                                     ASHLEY
                         You need a COAT!

                                     RUDY
                         Ash, you've gotten me enough --

                                     ASHLEY
                         No boyfriend of mine is going to 
                         walk around in negative-five degree 
                         wind chill without a goddamn good-
                         looking coat!

               She pulls out a hellacious black leather fringe number.

                                     RUDY
                         Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I 
                         haven't gotten you anything --

                                     ASHLEY
                         You got out, Nick. You're here.  
                         You're my Christmas.

               She puts the jacket against his chest, smiling. Rudy sighs.

                                     RUDY
                         It's two hundred dollars, Ash --

               She whips a Penney's card from her purse, grins wickedly:

                                     ASHLEY
                         You forget where I work?

                                     RUDY
                              (beat)
                         Beauty and fragrances.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho 
                         ho ho.

               She runs off with the jacket. Rudy turns to a dressing mirror, 
               left to stare at his reflection. An ex-con in rags, with a 
               half-dozen holiday shopping bags. To himself:

                                     RUDY
                         Just for the holidays, Nick. Then 
                         we'll tell her. We'll let her... 
                         have her holidays...

               Rudy nods till he convinces himself. Can't help but smile.

               INT. TOY STORE - DAY

               Puzzles, Barbies and dinosaurs. KIDS scurrying, PARENTS 
               chasing. Rudy and Ashley with a scared TEEN CLERK:

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         You can't find... what?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Toys for adults. Where are your toys 
                         for adults?

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         Toys for... adults?

                                     ASHLEY
                         C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? 
                         C'mon.

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         We sell children's toys --

                                     ASHLEY
                              (slams money down)
                         I got fifty dollars to spend in your 
                         store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you 
                         help me or not?

               The clerk glances around, then, low:

                                     TEEN CLERK
                         Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in 
                         aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Thank you.

               As bottles of wine, vodka and rum, cartons of egg nog and 
               orange juice, and countless prepackaged sandwiches come 
               scrolling past.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         You know what I was thinking, after 
                         our holiday hideaway? Instead of 
                         going back to Detroit, maybe we could 
                         go gambling. Y'know? Drive up to 
                         that Indian place you worked at. 
                         Wouldn't that be fun? I haven't gone 
                         gambling in forever!

               EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Light snow falls. Rudy, in his new black fringe eyesore, and 
               Ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt:

                                     RUDY
                         Well, I don't know about that --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good 
                         at. I mean, they'd give us some free 
                         games or something, wouldn't they? 
                         Since you worked there?

                                     RUDY
                         Security, Ash, I just worked security.  
                         They wouldn't be rolling out the red 
                         carpet --

                                     ASHLEY
                         And the slots, slots I'm good at 
                         too. Wouldn't that be fun?

                                     RUDY
                         We'll have more fun in Detroit.

                                     ASHLEY
                         We could live it up and --

                                     RUDY
                         Ashley. We're not going anywhere I 
                         used to work.

               It comes out too harsh. Ashley stops, a little hurt.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I just... I thought you'd have friends 
                         there...

               Rudy softens, touches her arms:

                                     RUDY
                         Hey. I been in prison for two years, 
                         Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't 
                         want to see me.

               He kisses her. She nods, dismisses it, kisses back.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Well, they don't know what the hell 
                         they're missing.

               EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

               Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside 
               joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to 
               the roof.

               She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to 
                         disturb us for the rest of the year. 
                         I get back in that room, you better 
                         be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

                                     RUDY
                         I'll see what I can do.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, lover. I'll see what you can do.

               She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring 
               his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their 
               shopping score. Gifts and goodies.

                                     RUDY
                              (sings, sotto)
                         I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-
                         pum-pum. No treasures for the king, 
                         pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...

               Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags 
               on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in:

                                     RUDY
                         ...but I got a girl to be with, rum-
                         pum-pum-pum...

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Hi, Nick.

               Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky 
               black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door 
               shut --

                                     RUDY
                         What the fuck --

               -- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets 
               an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a 
               mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again --

               -- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a 
               dresser.

               Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests 
               him to the ground. Grabs the bat --

               -- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a 
               little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the 
               bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --

               -- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries 
               and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head!

               Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again 
               in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing 
               into one wall, then another, YELLING for help --

                                     RUDY
                         HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!!

               -- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun.

               Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on.

               Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a 
               sawed-off on him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Welcome home, Nick.

               Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, 
               gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy 
               hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot 
               of road.

               Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, 
               bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.

                                     PUG
                         I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --

               -- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. 
               Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. 
               Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian 
               in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door.

               Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes 
               his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe.

                                     RUDY
                         You... you don't know me --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you 
                         real well.

                                     RUDY
                         No, you can't --

                                     GABRIEL
                         The hell I can't.

               As the room's door gets kicked open --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the 
                         fucking tree!

               and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting 
               forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans --

                                     RUDY
                         ASHLEY!

               Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, 
               followed by Ashley, face in branches --

                                     ASHLEY
                         I'm telling you, we got the best one 
                         in the store... I don't know why 
                         people want their houses smelling 
                         like the stupid woods...

               She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he 
               slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground.

                                     RUDY
                         NO!

                                     ASHLEY
                         NICK!

               Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks 
               Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug 
               have her held firmly. Her face to the wall --

                                     GABRIEL
                              (re: the silver tree)
                         Hope her taste in men's better than 
                         her taste in Christmas.

               Ashley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey, sis. Happy holidays.

               Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel.

               Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her 
               back against the wall for her trouble --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Jumpy, don't hurt her, now.

               Gabriel steps to Rudy. Studies him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So. This is the guy you been waiting 
                         for. Man of your dreams.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel -- !

                                     GABRIEL
                              (unimpressed)
                         Must have a way with stationery.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel, what are you doing!

               Gabriel raises the sawed-off to Rudy's chest. Rudy flinches, 
               but Merlin's got him.

                                     ASHLEY
                         GABRIEL!!!

               Gabriel fixes her with a stare. She shuts up. To Rudy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         You better be here to be good to 
                         her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been 
                         good to you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel, let him go --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Read a lot about you, Nick.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What are you doing here?!

                                     GABRIEL
                         Read you're a man of some knowledge.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel!

                                     GABRIEL
                         A man of some travels.

                                     ASHLEY
                         GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!

               Rudy's trying to speak, voice CHOKED. Gabriel nods to Merlin, 
               who again eases his hold. Rudy coughs.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm... not... Nick...

               Gabriel frowns. Rudy turns to Ashley.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm not him. I...
                              (then to Gabriel)
                         You want something from Nick, you 
                         got the wrong guy.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (hurt)
                         Nick...

               Gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed-off, 
               and SWINGS it into Rudy's stomach. Rudy buckles. Panicked.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Who are you now.

                                     RUDY
                         You got the wrong guy! She thinks 
                         I'm Nick, I'm not!

                                     GABRIEL
                              (to Merlin)
                         Put him in the truck.

                                     RUDY
                         I was in the joint with him! I knew 
                         about him and her, okay!? I took his 
                         place!

                                     GABRIEL
                         You what...

                                     RUDY
                         I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended 
                         I was him! I knew about her letters!  
                         Jesus Christ, whatever you want from 
                         him -- I'm not Nick!
                              (to Ashley)
                         I -- I just wanted to be --

               A glance of regret amidst his desperation. Ashley stares 
               back, confused, searching his eyes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're not Nick Mason...

                                     RUDY
                         I shared his cell!

                                     GABRIEL
                         But you were saying you were...

                                     RUDY
                         Yes!

                                     GABRIEL
                         So you could get with my sister.

                                     RUDY
                         Yes!

                                     GABRIEL
                         So you could get down her chimney.

                                     RUDY
                         Yes!

                                     GABRIEL
                         And you think telling me that's gonna 
                         help your cause.

               Gabriel RATCHETS him across the chin with the gun butt. Rudy 
               hits the floor. Gabriel spins on Ashley, enraged:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Is this him!?

                                     ASHLEY
                              (reaches for Rudy)
                         Don't hurt him...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Is this the fucker you been writing 
                         all year!?

                                     ASHLEY
                              (reaches for Rudy)
                         Please, Gabriel, don't...

               Gabriel puts the gun to Rudy's head.

                                     GABRIEL
                         IS THIS NICK MASON!!??

                                     ASHLEY
                         YES!!!

               Gabriel doesn't shoot. Studies Rudy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well, he's gonna have to learn to 
                         give you some respect.

               Gabriel KICKS Rudy in the jaw. Ashley screams. Gabriel motions 
               to his boys: Jumpy and Pug drag her outside. Gabriel KICKS 
               Rudy again. Rudy lies there and takes it.

               Merlin lights a cig, examines Rudy and Ashley's grocery bags:

                                     MERLIN
                         Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Take 'em.

                                     MERLIN
                         How 'bout the tree? You want the 
                         tree?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Leave the tree.

               Merlin nods, tucks the bags under his arms, leaves the room.

               Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile:

                                     GABRIEL
                         I've read your letters, motherfucker.  
                         Don't play no reindeer games with 
                         me.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, 
               arcing into the blackness.

               CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward, 
               emblazoned with "Great Lakes Trucking." There's an airbrush 
               painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru 
               a flaming radial tire, and the legend "Motor City Monster."

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT

               Gabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies. 
               A TRUCK passes; Gabriel waves. A moment later, the CB 
               crackles:

                                     PASSING DRIVER (OVER CB)
                         Hey there, Monster! What're you 
                         hauling this far north?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hell, Bugeye. How you doin'? Ain't 
                         hauling, man, I'm up for the holidays. 
                         Gonna have myself a holiday... for a 
                         goddamn change...

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON RUDY

               eyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. He 
               winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you 
                         now. You're okay...

               Her hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open.

               ON FULL SCENE

               They're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats, 
               rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova.

               Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his 
               wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze.

               In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping 
               chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on. Gives 
               Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't 
                         hurt you anymore.

                                     RUDY
                         Your brother...

               Ashley nods. Rudy looks around, remembering.

                                     RUDY
                         ...the truck driver...

                                     ASHLEY
                         He's not a bad person, Nick... he's 
                         not...

               From the corner, Pug spits some chaw. Ashley wheels.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You're not gonna hurt him anymore!

               Pug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... 
                         he's come over more and more. To the 
                         apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 
                         'member, with the tit job --

                                     RUDY
                         What the fuck is going on.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He read the letters, Nick. Some day 
                         I wasn't there. He went through my 
                         room. He found your letters.

                                     RUDY
                         What's going ON!!!

               The truck shakes.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He knows you worked in that casino.

               Rudy stares at her. She's scared

                                     RUDY
                         You motherfucker.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, no --

                                     RUDY
                         You sold him out.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick --

                                     RUDY
                         When'd you decide to do it, Ash?  
                         After which of his letters, huh?  
                         The fortieth? The fiftieth? The 
                         first?!

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, what are you --

               She reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles 
               against the opposite wall of the trailer.

                                     RUDY
                         I'M NOT NICK!
                              (raging)
                         You thought you'd fuck him over?!  
                         Well he's fucked you! I've never 
                         worked at some casino! I can't help 
                         you! Because he's not me!

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, I love you --

                                     RUDY
                         JESUS CHRIST!

                                     PUG
                         Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.

                                     RUDY
                         I'M NOT NICK!

               Ashley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. He 
               tries to fight her off. She won't let go.

                                     RUDY
                         Get the hell off of me!

                                     ASHLEY
                              (hard whisper)
                         Nick, it won't work. It won't work!

               Rudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye. 
               Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley 
               turns them away from the little guy's view

                                     ASHLEY
                         He'll kill you.

                                     RUDY
                         You're not hearing me here --

                                     ASHLEY
                         My brother's killed people, I know 
                         he has. Truckers. If you talk him 
                         into thinking you're not you, you'll 
                         only get yourself dead.

                                     RUDY
                         He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did 
                         he.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, please, it's me --

                                     RUDY
                         You told him about Nick's letters.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, Nick, no --

                                     RUDY
                         You're in on this.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I love you!

               Rudy stares at her coldly.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know, in a way, I'm glad it's me. 
                         'Cause you woulda broken his heart.

               Ashley stares, panicked. Pug's still watching them.

                                     RUDY
                         Your pen palls dead, lady.

                                     ASHLEY
                         If you say that, if you keep saying 
                         that, they will kill you. If they 
                         think you're not you, they will kill 
                         you. Don't you see? I know what you're 
                         doing, but it won't work!

                                     RUDY
                         Nick died for me....

                                     ASHLEY
                         I won't let him hurt you! He just 
                         wants what you know!

                                     RUDY
                              (ruefully)
                         ...maybe I die for Nick...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Just tell him what you know, Nick! 
                         That's all they want! And we'll get 
                         out of this!

               Rudy gives her a stone cold stare. Ashley crumbles, touching 
               his face, shaking her head, tears. Devastated.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He found them... I swear, Nick...
                              (helpless)
                         ...he found them...

               The truck shudders through downshifts, to a groaning stop. 
               Ashley embraces Rudy fiercely, holding on for the last.

               The trailer gate RATTLES open into the truck's roof.

               Ashley shuts her eyes.

               EXT. REST STOP/INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CONTINUOUS

               The rig all alone at a snowy rest area. Gabriel, Merlin and 
               Jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. Gabriel surveys, 
               then lifts a piece of paper:

                                     GABRIEL
                         "My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have 
                         been dreaming of you constantly, and 
                         knowing you are out there makes these 
                         walls not seem so close or so strong 
                         or so cold..."
                              (to Merlin/Jumpy)

                         me here, Nicky... where are we... 
                         oh, right, other side...
                              (turns paper over)
                         "Someday I'm gonna take you up by 
                         Lake S. Before I went in, before 
                         goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my 
                         situation, I used to work up at this 
                         casino, working security. Used to 
                         watch for people stealing chips, 
                         counting cards, getting piss-drunk, 
                         that kinda shit. Indian place, they 
                         hired this reject outta Vegas to run 
                         it, got about as much business sense 
                         as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a 
                         fun place to run some numbers and 
                         play."

               Gabriel puts the letter down.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're a good writer, Nick. I give 
                         this writing an A-plus.

                                     RUDY
                         I never worked at no casino.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (hopeless)
                         Nick...

               Rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:

                                     RUDY
                         That's the guy I was in with, I did 
                         my last ten months with him. He rode 
                         a two-year bit for manslaughter -- 
                         split a guy's skull open at a bar 
                         for harassing his girl. That's Nick 
                         Mason. He worked at that casino. 
                         He's the one who wrote her letters.  
                         Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job 
                         was a Quickie Lube, I did five for 
                         lifting cars. I don't know shit about 
                         blackjack, I don't know shit about 
                         Indians. I'm not him.

               Gabriel stares at him. Then crumples the letter.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Bury this guy.

               Merlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He 
               HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel, you promised!

                                     GABRIEL
                         I promised that when he helped us, 
                         we'd be gone! When he helped us!  
                         Loverboy don't want to play!

               Merlin and Jumpy drop to the snow, picking Rudy up.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You promised me!

                                     GABRIEL
                         And you promised me you'd get your 
                         sweetheart to help!

               Rudy meets eyes with Ashley. She's caught.

                                     GABRIEL
                         He'd rather die than be with you, 
                         he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend 
                         anyway.
                              (to Merlin/Jumpy)
                         Bury him all over the place.

                                     ASHLEY
                         NO!

               She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her 
               into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out 
               of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock.

               Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark 
               and snowy woods ahead...

                                     MERLIN
                         Beats prison, I guess.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!!

               Rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a 
               handgun, as he muses for the very first time:

                                     JUMPY
                         The problem with prison... is that 
                         it is founded on the fundamentally 
                         flawed perception of rehabilitation 
                         through punishment. A society can't 
                         hope to create a "changed man" by 
                         surrounding him with the worst in 
                         his fellow man; what it 
                         "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction 
                         that if he can survive the inhumanity 
                         of prison, what then, can he not 
                         withstand? He has seen man's darkest 
                         soul and kept his sight: what is 
                         left for such a man? What faith? 
                         What fear?

               At the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin --

                                     JUMPY
                         Don't get no blood on my boots --

               The gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber. 
               Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and --

                                     RUDY
                         WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!

               Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns.

                                     RUDY
                         About the Tomahawk! What the hell do 
                         you want to know!

               His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating.

                                     RUDY
                         I spend six months writing poetry 
                         and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. 
                         Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want 
                         me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.

               Ashley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Everything.

               Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground:

                                     ASHLEY
                         I love you... Nick, I love you...

               Rudy won't meet her eyes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.

                                     RUDY
                         She says a lot of things.

                                     GABRIEL
                         She's getting you to help us... 'cause 
                         she knows if you don't, you're dead. 
                         You just tell us what we need to 
                         know, you two live happily ever after.  
                         My sister loves you, motherfucker, 
                         and I ain't gonna have you break her 
                         heart.

                                     RUDY
                         Wish I had a brother like you.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A girl says she loves you, you say 
                         something.

               Rudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness.

                                     RUDY
                         I had better sex in prison.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna 
                         be working together here.
                              (to his boys)
                         Get him back in the rig.

               Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to 
               him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes 
               silent, casts her eyes to the snow.

                                     PUG (O.S.)
                         He's not the guy, Monster.

               Everyone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled 
               next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw.

               It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls.

                                     PUG
                         Whole time you were driving, he was 
                         telling her he's not the guy, he's 
                         not the guy. I know why he'd tell us 
                         he's not the guy. why's he telling 
                         her he's not the guy? What if he's 
                         not the guy?

               Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         The man who wrote those letters loved 
                         Ashley, boys. He lived for her love.
                              (nods)
                         Let's see him live for love.

               Gabriel puts a gun under Rudy's chin. Rudy flinches.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where's she work?

                                     RUDY
                         What?

                                     GABRIEL
                              (forces gun harder)
                         Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't 
                         she? Where's she work?

                                     RUDY
                         J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What's her middle name?

                                     RUDY
                              (thinking hard)
                         Samantha.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What'd they call her in high school?

                                     RUDY
                         Bam Bam.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What'd they call her in college?

                                     RUDY
                         What college.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where'd she drop her cherry?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel!

                                     RUDY
                         Canada.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Be more specific.

                                     RUDY
                         A station wagon in Canada.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What's her greatest fear?

                                     RUDY
                         Her brother.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.

                                     RUDY
                         No. It's her brother.

               Rudy stares him down. Gabriel shrugs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's love.

               He puts the gun away. Ashley regains her breath.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Let's get back on the road. It's 
                         time to start talking, Nick. Time to 
                         start telling tales --

                                     RUDY
                         Nick don't talk till Nick gets 
                         something.

               Gabriel gives a challenging stare. Rudy stares right back.

               It's a showdown.

                                     RUDY
                         Hot. Chocolate.

               The trucker slowly smiles. His crew chuckles.

                                     MERLIN
                         You want that for here or to go?

                                     RUDY
                         I been in Iron Mountain for two years, 
                         truck driver. I do one more crime, 
                         I'm back there for good, so fuck you 
                         and fuck your sister and fuck your 
                         trucker friends. You want to hear 
                         about some goddamn job of mine? I 
                         want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.

               They've stopped laughing.

                                     RUDY
                         And some pecan-fucking-pie.

               INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON HOT CHOCOLATE AND PECAN PIE 

               The six of them sit in a booth, Ashley leaning on Rudy's 
               shoulder apologetically. The four truckers watch him scarf 
               his pie. "White Christmas" plays over the speakers.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So when you worked there --

               Rudy raises a finger sharply. Silence. He continues eating.  
               Scrapes the last of his pie crumbs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You knew the place --

                                     RUDY
                         Hey.

               Rudy stares hard. Gobbles the crumbs, washes it down with 
               his hot chocolate. Savors it. Sets the mug down.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know, I could really go for some 
                         onion rings.

               Gabriel nods to Jumpy, who snaps his arm up, SMASHING his 
               knuckles into Rudy's face.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's 
                         all you ever said...

                                     GABRIEL
                         We're talking, aren't we?

               Rudy holds his nose. Blood trickles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         How much money's in that casino?  
                         Day-to-day.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The hell you don't.

                                     RUDY
                              (sighs, a guess)
                         Five million?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You wrote Ash that letter, you told 
                         her that story 'bout working Christmas 
                         Eve, bout how they'd send half the 
                         security guys home, nobody comin, in 
                         that night. And the rest of you got 
                         shit-faced drinking hot buttered 
                         rum. That a true story now?

                                     RUDY
                         Christmas... Eve...

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know where the guards are. You 
                         know how to get in and out. You know 
                         where the money is.
                              (nods)
                         We're taking down that casino, 
                         convict. You're the guy gonna tell 
                         us how.

               Rudy turns slightly pale.

                                     RUDY
                         Hey, it's... been two years --

                                     GABRIEL
                         We got faith in you, Nick Mason.
                              (smiles)
                         You're our inside man.

               INT. TRUCK STOP BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Rudy slams in, letting the door smack shut behind him. It's 
               a tiny windowless closet. Rudy kicks a stall door, pacing.

                                     RUDY
                         ...goddamn it, Rudy... goddamn it... 
                         goddamn girl, goddamn Nick... you're 
                         so smart, so fucking smart...

               He stalks a circle, grabs a sink, and stares at his reflection 
               in the mirror. He looks a wreck. He settles down.

                                     RUDY
                         Where's your Christmas dinner now...

               INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER

               A COUPLE leaves the booth behind Gabriel's crew. Pug and 
               Merlin reach over, steal their leftovers and dig in. Ashley 
               fidgets.

               Jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside:

                                     JUMPY
                         I've read where the retail industry 
                         does fifty percent of its business 
                         between December 1st and December 
                         25th. Half the year's business, in 
                         one month's time. It seems to me an 
                         intelligent society would legislate 
                         a second such gift-giving holiday, 
                         create, say, a Christmas Two -- late 
                         May, early June -- to further 
                         stimulate growth and prosperity. For 
                         who would protest such a holiday? 
                         Taking the fifty percent model, a 
                         Christmas Two would grow this 
                         country's annual per capita income 
                         by close to one-third.

               Everyone stares at Jumpy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Christmas Two.

               The Indian nods. Gabriel shakes his head.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ever since you started night school, 
                         you been givin, me headaches, Jumpy.  
                         Headaches.
                              (to Merlin/Pug)
                         Go see what's taking him.

               INT. BATHROOM - SAME

               Rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his 
               grip, ready to strike. Listening... listening...

               AS the door SLAMS open, swinging fast and BASHING him in the 
               head.

               Rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out.

               Merlin and Pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. Pug 
               spits tobacco. Hits Merlin's boots again.

               INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER

               Rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. Ashley reaches for 
               his hand; he pulls it away. Gabriel unfolds a piece of paper -- 
               it's a crude map.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Here ya go, convict. We cased the 
                         place in the fall, got the layout 
                         down. What you're gonna do is show 
                         us where each of these doors go, 
                         what the upstairs level looks like, 
                         where they got the alarms, all of 
                         it.

                                     MERLIN
                         And where they hide the real money.

               Merlin exhales some smoke in Pug's face. Pug hacks, shoves 
               him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And Nick? If you even think about 
                         setting us up, giving us some bad 
                         information? We go down... you go 
                         down...
                              (lets it settle)
                         Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards 
                         are there gonna be?

               Rudy surveys the table. All five waiting for him. Sighs.

                                     RUDY
                         Hell. Ten?

                                     GABRIEL
                         And which of these doors here lead 
                         up to the security level?

               Gabriel passes the map across the table. Rudy stares at it.

                                     MERLIN
                         Start talking, Nick.

               Rudy's still staring.

                                     PUG
                         Start talkin

                                     RUDY
                         Who the hell made this map.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         I said, who the hell made the map?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I did.

                                     RUDY
                         This isn't the Tomahawk.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What the fuck are you talking about.

                                     RUDY
                         This is the front entrance, right?  
                         You get through the slots, you hit 
                         craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's 
                         here to here -- lined up. What's 
                         this, the cage? Cage is over there, 
                         hard to get to, you got it all mixed 
                         around --

                                     PUG
                         That's what it looks like!

                                     RUDY
                         Since when? What the hell is this 
                         room?

                                     MERLIN
                         Buffet. Whaddya think it is?

                                     RUDY
                         Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What 
                         the hell kind of map is this?!

               Gabriel reaches across the booth, grabs Rudy's shirt, pulls 
               his face to table level:

                                     GABRIEL
                         We walked the place for a week.

                                     RUDY
                         And I worked there. For a year.

               Neither man blinks.

                                     PUG
                         Map is kinda dirty, Monster...

                                     RUDY
                         They changed the layout.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What?

               Rudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon.

                                     RUDY
                         They changed the layout -- whadda 
                         they call you? Mr. Monster? They 
                         remodeled the place. When I worked 
                         there -- listen to me -- guy that 
                         managed the joint, guy who ran it--

                                     ASHLEY
                         Jack. Jack Bangs.

                                     RUDY
                         Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was 
                         always talking bout fixing the place 
                         up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta 
                         gone and done it while I was in the 
                         Mountain.
                              (pushes map away)
                         I don't know this map, man. How the 
                         hell am I supposed to tell you what 
                         door goes where?

                                     GABRIEL
                         They wouldn't have changed the 
                         security setup.

                                     RUDY
                         When I worked there, this was Bangs, 
                         office. Back here. He kept a little 
                         safe in the... uh, the wall, money 
                         held take for himself, skim from the 
                         Indians. Called it the... uh...
                              (stumbling)
                         ...the Powwow Safe.

                                     JUMPY
                         The Powwow Safe?

                                     RUDY
                         His personal safe, he gave it a name.  
                         Now you're telling me they've taken 
                         his office, put the buffet there?  
                         Then who knows what else they changed.

               Gabriel stares at him, suspicious.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So what the hell good are you...

                                     RUDY
                         You'd have to get me inside.
                              (carefully)
                         Get inside, watch where the money's 
                         moving, see where the guards are 
                         going. Then I could work with your 
                         map.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Wrong, convict. You walk in there, 
                         they recognize you.

                                     PUG
                         So what?

                                     GABRIEL
                         They recognize him, they'll remember 
                         him after the job goes down.

                                     RUDY
                         They won't recognize me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Why not.

                                     RUDY
                         Trust me. They won't recognize me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We'll trust you when we're rich. Why 
                         not.

                                     RUDY
                         'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.

               Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.

                                     RUDY
                         I give you the wrong information, 
                         you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't 
                         know your damn map. So you can either 
                         find a way to get me in there... or 
                         you can shoot me right now.

               A WAITRESS comes over, drops their check on the table. It 
               rests near Rudy. Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.

               And pushes the check his way.

               EXT. SNOWY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The "Motor City Monster" RUMBLES along a two-lane blacktop. 
               Across barren Michigan tundra. A sign reads "You Are Now 
               Entering Powahachee Indian Lands. No Littering."

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT

               Gabriel drives, with Ashley beside him. Rudy sits in the 
               sleeper, Jumpy sitting guard.

               OUT THE WINDOW

               they pass a brightly neon-lit building, with a parking lot 
               full of cars. The Tomahawk Casino, with a red neon axe 
               pointing the way.

               And a marquee which reads: "10X ODDS ON CRAPS. $5.95 PRIME 
               RIB. PERFORMING TONIGHT: DAKOTA!"

               The truck motors on by. Gabriel nods to Rudy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Bring back some memories, Nick?

                                     RUDY
                         More than you know.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN - NIGHT

               A Midwestern castles-and-Camelot-themed chain hotel, amidst 
               an outcrop of roadside exit civilization: fast food and gas. 
               The Great Lakes Trucking rig parked in the hotel's lot.

               INT. KNIGHTS INN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Faux stonemasonry and torches. "Regal" purple carpets. Gabriel 
               and his crew escort Rudy into --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               -- his quarters. Jumpy marches Rudy to the bed, snaps a 
               handcuff around his ankle --

                                     RUDY
                         What the hell is this? What happened 
                         to working together?

               -- and snaps the other cuff to the bedframe.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Rather be back in the Mountain?

                                     RUDY
                         Might as well be.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't have Weather Channel in the 
                         Mountain, Nick.

               Gabriel tosses him a TV remote. Merlin rips the room's phone 
               out of the wall, takes it. They return to the hallway.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you 
                         got singing for your supper to do.

               The truckers leave. Rudy tugs at his ankle cuff, sighs, 
               collapses back on the bed. Ashley has remained.

               Rudy sits up, sees her.

                                     RUDY
                         Get your own room.

               She approaches instead. Sits beside. Gently:

                                     ASHLEY
                         He said he wanted to talk to you.  
                         When he found the letters... he said 
                         "when your boyfriend gets out, I 
                         wanna talk to him." I thought he 
                         meant back in Detroit. I thought he 
                         meant --

                                     RUDY
                         But you knew why. Knew why, didn't 
                         ya.

               Ashley stands her ground, guilty.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I thought we'd have a few more days.

                                     RUDY
                         For what? You to talk me into 
                         "helping"? What, he promise you a 
                         share of the winnings?

                                     ASHLEY
                         No!

                                     RUDY
                         Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at 
                         least gotten that --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick! He wants to know how to rob 
                         it, and he'll leave you alone! That's 
                         all he wants!
                              (breaking down)
                         I hate him, Nick... you know how...

                                     RUDY
                         So get him outta your life. Get out 
                         of Michigan. They got perfume counters 
                         in Chicago, don't they?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Not without you.

               She reaches to touch him. Rudy turns his back on her.

                                     RUDY
                         Since when do some trucker pals start 
                         thinking big, anyway?

                                     ASHLEY
                         They run routes mostly east, retail 
                         stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows 
                         some guys in New York, Miami, guys 
                         he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 
                         'em with his regular loads.

                                     RUDY
                         He working for them on this one?

                                     ASHLEY
                         No. He wants to be working for himself 
                         someday.

                                     RUDY
                         And I'm his ticket.
                              (considers)
                         What's the last place they took down?

                                     ASHLEY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         Gabriel and his guys. What's the 
                         last place they robbed?

               Ashley frowns.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I don't think they've ever robbed 
                         anything before. I think they've 
                         just driven guns.

               Rudy looks at her with new interest.

                                     RUDY
                         They've never done a robbery?

                                     ASHLEY
                              (shrugs)
                         They're truck drivers.

               For the first time in a long time... Rudy smiles.

                                     RUDY
                         Then they do need me, don't they.  
                         They really need me...

                                     ASHLEY
                         We're gonna get out of here, Nick.  
                         We're gonna get out of this...

                                     RUDY
                         We? What "we"...

               Rudy stares at her. The smile gone.

                                     RUDY
                         Get your own room, Ashley.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick...

                                     RUDY
                         Get your own room.

               Ashley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to 
               say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way.

                                     ASHLEY
                         If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd 
                         have been gone. You'd have gotten on 
                         that bus and stayed on it. And if 
                         that's selfish, I am. If that's lying, 
                         I'm a liar. But I been dealing with 
                         fucked-up brother and his fucked-up 
                         friends for a long time, and I was 
                         stronger than him then and I'm 
                         stronger than him now. 'Cause he 
                         showed up for money. I showed up for 
                         love.
                              (hard)
                         And if you're so ready to make me 
                         your enemy... then what did you show 
                         up for, Nick. What did you really 
                         want... with me...

               With a fiery look, she strides from the room.

               Rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end 
               table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards.

               Out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking 
               lot.

               Rudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN 
               get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads "Ice Fishermen Do 
               It All Year Long."

               Rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He 
               turns back, surveys his new prison cell

                                     RUDY
                         They've never done a robbery...
                              (nods)
                         Christmas is looking up.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MORNING

               The bed has been dragged to the door to the bathroom, the 
               comforter and pillow are on the floor, "Miracle on 34th St." 
               is on the TV, and Rudy lies asleep on the ground, ankle still 
               cuffed.

               Two SHADOWS fall across him.

               INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

               Rudy is brusquely dragged out by Jumpy and Merlin, passing 
               Ashley, who lies asleep in the hall, head on a pillow.

                                     MERLIN
                         Having romance problems, Romeo?

                                     RUDY
                         Not with you.

               They march him onward. Rudy glances over his shoulder at 
               Ashley.

               Who spent the night at his door.

               INT. GAME ROOM - MORNING

               A wood-panelled room adjacent to a small indoor pool, with 
               arcade games and a dart board. Gabriel's with Pug, tossing 
               darts, as Jumpy and a chain-smoking Merlin haul Rudy in.

                                     PUG
                         Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of 
                         the day you don't smoke?

                                     MERLIN
                         There anytime you don't got a mouthful 
                         of shit?

                                     PUG
                         Cancer-sucker.

                                     MERLIN
                         Acid-chewer.

               Gabriel THWAPS a dart into the board, to shut them up.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Take a look what Pug's bought for 
                         ya.

               Pug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine. Cowboy boots, 
               spurs, a black cowboy hat, a black rhinestone jacket and a 
               longhaired wig tumbles out.

                                     RUDY
                         A cowboy. You're going to send me 
                         into an Indian casino disguised as a 
                         cowboy. Have you thought this entirely 
                         through?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Put it on.

               Merlin and Jumpy shove Rudy toward the merchandise. Gabriel 
               slams another dart into the board, then turns:

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're a country-western singer up 
                         from Nashville for the the holidays. 
                         Visiting your Grandma on the lake, 
                         driving into the Tomahawk for some 
                         scotch and slots. You only play the 
                         slots, you got that? Don't want no 
                         dealer friend of yours recognizing 
                         you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.

                                     RUDY
                         What kind of half-ass cowboy plays 
                         the slots?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You do.

                                     RUDY
                         At least gimme video poker.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shut the fuck up. You play what your 
                         girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in 
                         with you. You talk to her, otherwise 
                         you don't talk to nobody. You walk 
                         the room as many times as you want, 
                         but the second you come out, I want 
                         to know the run of the place.

               Rudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear.

                                     RUDY
                         Do I get a country-western name?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You get recognized, convict, You get 
                         a country-western funeral.

               EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY

               The Chevy Nova crunches into the parking lot in the shadow 
               of the gaudy neon axe.

               INT. NOVA - DAY

               Rudy's in "disguise": paste-on goatee, tinted shades and 
               black cowboy gear. Very Nashville Network.

               He's wedged between Jumpy and Merlin, wearing handcuffs. 
               Gabriel, Ashley and Pug in the back.

                                     RUDY
                         Y'know what, guys? I woke up this 
                         morning, I got a really lucky feeling 
                         going on. I mean it, I'm feeling 
                         that good. I wouldn't be surprised 
                         if I walk in there, pull a handle 
                         and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't 
                         even have to --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get out.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

               Rudy stamps feet, shivering in the cold, as Merlin unlocks 
               his cuffs. Gabriel reaches to help Ashley out --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Get your goddamn hands off me --

               She edges toward Rudy, then stops. A chill still there.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You got one hour.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm gonna need some money.

               Gabriel hands a bill.

                                     RUDY
                         Ten dollars? What do I do with ten 
                         dollars?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't tip.

                                     RUDY
                         Monster. If we're working together 
                         here, we gotta be working together. 
                         I can't walk in there looking like 
                         the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten 
                         bucks to throw down. You don't want 
                         me getting noticed, right? Not getting 
                         noticed costs a guy at least a couple 
                         hundred.

               Gabriel glares, turns to his crew. Mutters, rubs his fingers 
               together. Merlin, Pug and Jumpy reach for their wallets, 
               grumbling. Gabriel takes a few twenties from each.

               Rudy nods thanks as Gabriel hands him the cash --

                                     GABRIEL
                              (threateningly)
                         Don't. Lose.

               Rudy pockets the wad, hooks his elbow for Ashley to slip her 
               arm through. Grins with a drawl:

                                     RUDY
                         You ready to gamble, darlin'?

               She regards him warily, but puts her arm in his.

                                     RUDY
                              (to the boys)
                         Y'all take care of my guitar.

               He tips his hat, and strides for the casino entrance. Gabriel 
               and his truckers watch them go.

                                     MERLIN
                              (grumbles)
                         Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get in there and watch 'em. Watch 
                         their every fuckin' move.

               INT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY

               The cascade of JINGLING and JANGLING COINS fills the brightly 
               lit, horrendously-carpeted space. Wooden-beamed ceilings 
               suggest a rustic theme, but the neon slots, lush green tables 
               and red wheels of fortune are pure Midwest Vegas.

               The Tomahawk is tiny by Nevada standards, about the size of 
               a large bingo hall. This morning, about FIFTY GAMBLERS mill 
               about.

               Skimpily-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESSES, most of them Powahachee 
               Indians, pimp drinks. Bored DEALERS deal.

               As the sound of slot machine payoffs suddenly go silent --

               INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON STEREO SYSTEM

               And some scattered cassettes, labeled "Big Winners," "Little 
               Winners," and "Medium Cash." A HAND pops the tape currently 
               in the system -- "Big, BIG Winners" and flips it over. Presses 
               play. The sounds of JINGLING and JANGLING return.

               ON FULL SCENE

               An office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass. 
               JACK BANGS, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit 
               and high blood pressure, paces his office. He's got the air 
               of a washed-up gameshow host, Wink Martindale, Peter 
               Tommarkin, one of those hacks. Right now he's all caffeine.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         There's an S-word I'd really like to 
                         throw in the discussion here, guys, 
                         cause it's a big part of what's going 
                         on. Big element, 'kay? S-word. It's 
                         a serious issue, serious factor, so 
                         I'm just gonna get it out there, 
                         throw it an out there, so we can 
                         know it, we can talk about it, we 
                         can get things done...
                              (big pause)
                         Snow. Are you with me, guys? Snow. 
                         Big time, fucking, grade-A, God-
                         quality, S-N-O-W-snow.

               Two INDIAN GOVERNORS sit before him. Business-dressed, with 
               overcoats, ponytails. One gray-haired, one jet-black.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They 
                         don't know it, they don't want it, 
                         they got laws against the stuff. 
                         They got Egypt down there, right, 
                         they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they 
                         got ancient Rome, but where's the 
                         Winter Castle, right? Where's the 
                         Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big 
                         Fucking Igloo?

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We understand you, Mr. Bangs.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Capades? They don't do it. Mittens?  
                         Outlawed. Why?

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We're aware of your position.

                                     JACK BANGS
                              (picks up a chip)
                         Because down there this is money.  
                         Up here this is heat.
                              (pleads)
                         You wanted Vegas quality, I brought 
                         it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I 
                         gave it to you. But guys, please, 
                         guys... I can't get you Vegas 
                         profits... till one of ya does some 
                         spirit dance and does something about 
                         this snow.

               The tribal governors stare him down.

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         We understand the Paiutes' casino 
                         saw a net profit of twelve million 
                         dollars last year.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         The Paiutes, they cook their books.

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         The Waitela reservation made seventeen 
                         million.

                                     JACK BANGS
                              (sobers)
                         Seventeen?

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         Perhaps you have researched this, 
                         Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our 
                         side of the lake that much greater 
                         than the snowfall on theirs?

               Jack Bangs stares at them both. Considers his next move --

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I'm bringing in this great showroom 
                         act next week; these three Russian 
                         girls, they look like Meryl Streep, 
                         they can juggle anything.

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         Mr. Bangs.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Guys. We're doing it right, here. 
                         $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in 
                         Michigan. Nobody.

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         The tribe is concerned that many of 
                         your... new ideas are not resulting 
                         in any new venues.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I'm putting liquor in the drinks, 
                         I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I 
                         got the girls showing sixteen-percent 
                         more skin! Show me another buffet's 
                         gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! 
                         Whaddya want me to do?!

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We want to see our casino making 
                         money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money 
                         for our community.

                                     OLD GOVERNOR
                         Like the Paiutes and the Waitela.

               The young man stands, stares Jack Bangs in the eye.

                                     YOUNG GOVERNOR
                         We want you doing the job... that we 
                         brought you here to do.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - DAY

               Rudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket 
               of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two 
               SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside:

                                     ASHLEY
                         So does it look a lot different?

                                     RUDY
                         Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's 
                         the main expansion. Tables've been 
                         moved around; the big man's office, 
                         I dunno, might be upstairs now.

               They settle at a slot machine. Another SECURITY GUARD walks 
               past them. Rudy turns his back. Ashley notices.

                                     ASHLEY
                         That guy knows you?

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.

               At the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the 
               slots.

               Rudy sees them.

                                     RUDY
                         You start spending your brother's 
                         money. I'm gonna take a circuit around 
                         the joint, check for any new ins and 
                         outs. I'll snag us some drinks.

               As he strides away --

                                     ASHLEY
                              (sotto)
                         Be careful, Nick...

               MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO

               with Rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking 
               out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS.

               Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian 
               governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors 
               turn their backs an him and storm out.

               ARRIVING AT THE BAR

                                     RUDY
                         Couple rum and Cokes, please.

                                     INDIAN BARTENDER
                         You want that rum and Coke or rum 
                         and Pepsi?

               Rudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy 
               still scans the tables, settling on --

               A BLACKJACK TABLE

               where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of 
               them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. 
               Rudy studies this kid for moment.

                                     JACK BANGS (O.S.)
                         Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything.

               BACK AT THE BAR

               Jack Bangs sidles up, distraught. The barkeep hands him a 
               bottle. Bangs takes a swig.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. 
                         They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I 
                         can't go back...

                                     BARTENDER
                         What does the tribe want?

                                     JACK BANGS
                         They want gold-paved roads is what 
                         they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin' 
                         Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the 
                         interstate. Nothing I can do about 
                         that, man, I didn't pick the spot 
                         for your reservation.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Neither did we.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Yeah, yeah, whatever.

               Rudy gets his drinks, as Jack Bangs turns his way:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run 
                         the place. Nice to have you in the 
                         Tomahawk. Tell me something...

               Rudy winces, glancing to see Merlin and Jumpy watching him. 
               Frowns on their faces.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         ...does upstate Michigan need another 
                         roadside casino or does upstate 
                         Michigan need an international gaming 
                         destination?

                                     RUDY
                              (wants outta here)
                         Roadside casino?

               Jack Bangs, smile falls flat.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Well, so how'd you hear about this 
                         place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass 
                         mailings? Cable TV?

                                     RUDY
                         Prison.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Prison?!

               Rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks 
               sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before 
               he can ask, the guy shakes his head --

                                     FAT GUY
                         I just stopped in to use the can.

               Bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I 
                         can't...

               From the slots, we hear a JACKPOT PAYOFF.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Aw fuck.

               THROUGH THE TABLES

               walks Rudy, as Merlin sidles up next to him:

                                     MERLIN
                         What the hell was that about --

                                     RUDY
                         He didn't recognize me. Back off, 
                         willya? He didn't recognize me.

               Merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. 
               As he nears Ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where 
               the College Kid has left... heading for the bathroom --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents!

               -- and as a barely-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESS crosses between 
               Rudy and Ashley, blocking her view of him --

               Rudy pretends to crash into her, splashing the rum and Coke 
               into his own face --

                                     RUDY
                         Heyyyy!

               Reaching Ashley, his goatee is dripping --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, what happened --

                                     RUDY
                         There went my... damn... well, doesn't 
                         seem like security's all that 
                         switched... Ash, shit, this mustache 
                         is starting to fall off. I gotta fix 
                         this thing --
                              (hands her his glass)
                         -- drink this for me.

               He hustles for the bathroom. A moment later, Jumpy storms 
               by.

               Stops at Ashley.

                                     JUMPY
                         What happened?

                                     ASHLEY
                         He started losing his hair.

               INT. CASINO BATHROOM - DAY

               The College Kid is zipping up when Rudy SLAMS into his back, 
               money in hand, crashing him against the wall:

                                     RUDY
                         Hundred bucks to wear this jacket --

                                     COLLEGE KID
                         Jesus, man, don't kill me!

                                     RUDY
                         Nobody's killing you, kid. Santa's 
                         giving you a rhinestone jacket and a 
                         hundred bucks.

               INT. TOMAHAWK SAME

               Merlin's at a slot machine, watching the hall to the 
               bathrooms. A WAITRESS arrives, hands him a beer:

                                     MERLIN
                         Thanks, sister. How are ya.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Fuckin' freezing.

                                     MERLIN
                         Hell yeah. You work here long?

                                     WAITRESS
                         Five years. Since it opened.

                                     MERLIN
                         How long ago was your makeover?

                                     WAITRESS
                         My what?!

                                     MERLIN
                         No, the place. The remodeling. moving 
                         everything around.

               The waitress frowns.

                                     WAITRESS
                         The Tomahawk's looked the same since 
                         I started, mister.
                              (shrugs)
                         Only the losers change.

               Merlin stares at her. Then drops his drink to the floor, 
               charging for the bathroom.

               INT. BATHROOM

               As Merlin crashes in, seeing the cowboy hat and jacket, back 
               turned, adjusting a belt. As the figure turns around.

               It's the College Kid. Merlin stops in his tracks --

               -- as Rudy CRASHES into him from a stall, kicking his legs 
               out, driving his throat into a countertop. Merlin hits the 
               ground, gagging. Rudy wears the kid's sweatshirt:

                                     RUDY
                         GO! GO!

               The College Kid, shaking, hustles out the door.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - CONTINUOUS

               As the College Kid, in Rudy's black getup, strides out of 
               the bathroom hall, walking for the casino exit.

               From the slots, Ashley and Jumpy glance up, seeing him go. 
               From their vantage, it looks like Rudy. They frown.

               As they're watching the Kid hit the door, Rudy darts out of 
               the hall, heads the other way.

               EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA

               Gabriel and Pug sit sentry, seeing the cowboy figure leave 
               the casino. wandering into-the parking lot... away from them.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where the hell's he going?

                                     PUG
                         Where the hell's your sister?

               As the figure unlocks the driver's door of a Trans Am --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get him!

               Pug REVS the engine, speeds through the lot, cutting off the 
               Trans Am from backing away.

               Gabriel jumps out, HAULS the cowboy from his car and sees 
               it's the College Kid. Rudy's gone.

                                     COLLEGE KID
                              (scared shitless)
                         Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it...

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Merlin stumbles out of the bathroom, holding his throat. 
               Catches Jumpy and Ashley's eyes from the slots:

                                     JUMPY
                         Trouble.

               As Rudy charges toward COOKS, holding a buffet plate aloft --

                         MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM 
                         RARE??!!

               -- to the back of the building. In his stolen clothes, he 
               charges across the staff parking area and into the snowy 
               expanse of meadow beyond.

               Running for a thicket of winter woods.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Merlin and Jumpy stride out to join Gabriel and Pug. Ashley 
               follows, stumbling to keep up.

               EXT. SNOWY MEADOW - DAY

               Rudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. He keeps 
               struggling, losing his footing, fighting his way toward the 
               cover of trees. From far away...

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         Nick! Run! RUN!!!

               Rudy turns back to see Merlin, Jumpy and Pug round into view 
               back at the parking lot. They see him.

               And charge into the snowfield.

               Rudy breaks into the trees.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Gabriel pushes Ashley into the Nova and peals out of the 
               parking lot. Onto reservation roads.

               EXT. WOODS - ON CHASE - DAY

               Rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper 
               into snowdrifts, slowing him down. Stumbling forward, 
               shivering, breath frosting --

               -- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but 
               struggling too. With guns held.

               Rudy keeps battling through the drifts --

               -- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest; 
               the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to 
               struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him.

               Rudy keeps running.

               INT. NOVA

               Bouncing over a snowy dirt road, having found a shortcut 
               into the woods. Gabriel searches the trees, Ashley too.

               EXT. WOODS

               Merlin, Jumpy and Pug keep up their steady march. Rudy's 
               running figure now only fifty yards distant.

                                     MERLIN
                         You keep running, Nick! Keep running

               ANGLE to show Merlin's striding right in Rudy's bootprints. 
               Pug FIRES off two shots.

               They KICK UP snow just behind Rudy, struggling, panting...

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Wherever you run... we'll get there. 
                         Fast as you want... we'll be there.  
                         We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve, 
                         fifteen, twenty-hour days.

               Rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush 
               away his footprints. Realizes it's useless.

               A BULLET whistles through the pine branches.

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         We got nothing but time.

               Rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --

               -- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder. 
               Closer. It's a car's engine.

               Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out 
               a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. 
               Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it.

               EXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY

               As Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner 
               comes a Chevy Nova --

               -- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he 
               floors the gas, RACING right for Rudy.

               Rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded 
               slope cradling a meadow and frozen river --

                                     ASHLEY
                         No!!!

               -- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the 
               other way. Gabriel fights her for control --

               -- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road, 
               hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom, 
               a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!

               On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel 
               leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.

               AT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM

               Rudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball.

               BACK UP AT THE ROAD

               Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top 
               edge and takes aim --

                                     ASHLEY
                         RUN!!!

               -- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind --

               Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding 
               and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --

               TO THE BOTTOM

               -- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles 
               to clear the ice from his face --

               -- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw.

                                     RUDY
                         That's for reading her mail.

               He extends a hand to Ashley --

                                     RUDY
                         Come on.

               -- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls, 
               the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the 
               rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.

               More GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way 
               down the ravine.

               EXT. FROZEN RIVER - CONTINUOUS

               Rudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's 
               slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge 
               two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.

                                     RUDY
                         We get to the bridge, we're all right!

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, the ice is --

                                     RUDY
                         Get to the bridge!
                              (waving at traffic)
                         HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!

               He grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at 
               their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --

               -- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She 
               vanishes from sight in an instant!

               Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at 
               the ripples in the freezing water.

               Ashley's not coming up.

               RUDY

               Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge.

               Then the highway. Safety within sight.

               But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly 
               and LEAPS into the ice-hole --

               EXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE

               -- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body 
               like needles. He writhes, spinning around --

               -- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at 
               the ice above her. Strength giving out.

               Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, 
               panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further 
               away from the opening.

               With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, 
               pressing the barrel against the ice above them --

               -- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-
               blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches 
               for a sheath of ice, splashing --

               TO THE SURFACE

               -- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces 
               beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.

               Instinctively, they spin around --

               TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG

               -- standing right behind them. Guns trained.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (rubs his jaw)
                         At the rate you're going, Nick...  
                         I'm gonna have a hard time ever 
                         considering you family.

               He extends his hand, a gesture of help. But menacing.

                                     GABRIEL
                         How lucky ya feeling now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - DAY

               Pitch black. We can barely make out a huddled, fetal form, 
               quaking and trembling. It's Rudy. Dripping wet, on the verge 
               of hypothermia. Trying to stay conscious:

                                     RUDY
                         I-I-I-I have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br-
                         br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p
                              (struggling)
                         ...pum-pum-pum. N-n-no treasures for 
                         the k-k-k
                              (waits)
                         ...king.

               The trailer doors swing open, crashing harsh light upon him. 
               He squints into the light, shivering madly.

                                     RUDY
                         Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum.

               INT. KNIGHTS INN GAME ROOM - DAY

               Gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. 
               Bullseye.

               Merlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's 
               feet, unable to stand. Still trembling.

               A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway --

                                     MERLIN
                         Game room's closed.

               -- and Merlin slams the door in their face. Gabriel hurls 
               another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for 
                         effort and an honorary degree. I'm 
                         surprised you never escaped from the 
                         Mountain.

                                     RUDY
                              (teeth chattering)
                         ...never... tried...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In 
                         the spirit of the season, I'm going 
                         to give you a chance. I understand 
                         you're unhappy. Right outta the 
                         lockup, here against your will, it's 
                         the holidays and there's reruns on 
                         TV.
                              (beat)
                         So we're gonna have a contest.

               Gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We're each going to get one of these. 
                         Whichever one of us hits closer to 
                         the bullseye... gets what he wants.
                              (beat)
                         You land closer, you get Ashley.  
                         And you guys get to go free. I land 
                         closer... and we start getting your 
                         help.

               He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's 
               fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to 
               wedge it in.

                                     GABRIEL
                         May the best sportsman win.

               Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his 
               dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Damn.

               He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, 
               trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, 
               tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --

               -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his 
               icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally 
               tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.

               Gabriel smiles, steps close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Got something to say to me, Nick?

                                     RUDY
                         ...ttt..tt... two out of three?

               Gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. Rudy CRASHES 
               into a chair, flanked by video games.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What'd you tell that casino manager?

                                     RUDY
                         Nnn... nothing...

                                     GABRIEL
                         You were talking to him! What'd you 
                         tell him!?

                                     RUDY
                         Nothing... I promise-nothing...

                                     GABRIEL
                         MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?

                                     RUDY
                         NO!

               Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and 
               wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the 
               wall beside his ear.

               He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third 
               HITS the wall by his chin.

                                     RUDY
                         He thought I was some gambler... he 
                         didn't know me... he didn't recognize 
                         me!

                                     GABRIEL
                         I been driving rigs a long time, 
                         Nick. Four, five million miles of 
                         road. Worked for people who wouldn't 
                         keep me on less I was driving fifteen 
                         hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, 
                         I needed rest, shit, they'll hire 
                         someone else...

               Gabriel flings another dart. Just misses Rudy's other ear.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...Dispatcher's screaming for me to 
                         haul ass, he's got a load on the 
                         runback for me. Shipper's making me 
                         wait for the pickup, receiver's 
                         bitching 'bout the count...

               Another dart NAILS the wall, right through Rudy's hair.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...Got the cops at the bottom of 
                         every mountain, got the DOT at the 
                         top. And every day, every day, I see 
                         all those faces in their little airbag 
                         Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam-
                         faced kiddies, giving me that look 
                         to go to hell and get off their happy 
                         goddamn highway. Hey. They don't 
                         gotta get two thousand miles by 
                         sundown, or the gang don't eat come 
                         sunrise.

               Gabriel strides to Rudy, sitting stock-still, his head ringed 
               by darts. Stares him down.

                                     GABRIEL
                         It's time for me... to be working 
                         for me. I want mine, Nick. And I 
                         need you.
                              (frightening calm)
                         Did you tell your manager there's 
                         gonna be a robbery?

                                     RUDY
                         No, Gabriel... no...

               Gabriel pulls the darts free. Backs away again.

                                     RUDY
                         ...he... he asked me... how I'd heard 
                         about his place... he didn't know it 
                         was me...

               GABRIEL RAISES A DART TO THROW

                                     RUDY
                         I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS 
                         ME!

               -- and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve, 
               Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.

                                     RUDY
                         Man, Monster... just... just don't 
                         start trying to hit me...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Nick. I been trying to hit you.

               Gabriel rears back and WHISTLES another dart. It plugs into 
               Rudy's chest. Rudy screams. Gabriel FIRES another, skewering 
               him in the ribs. Then a third, fourth and fifth.

               Rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five 
               darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering 
               and spreading rivulets of blood.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Maybe that'll help sharpen your 
                         memory.

               Gabriel stalks close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Tonight we're gonna take another 
                         look at that map. And this time you're 
                         gonna tell me what I need to know.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - DAY

               Rudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the 
               floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits 
               guard, watching "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" on TV.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick! Jesus, Nick --

               She falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to 
               the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out --

                                     MERLIN
                         Pug.

               Pug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville.

                                     MERLIN
                         PUG!

               Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor 
               and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to 
                         you? What'd he do?

               She touches his bloodied chest. Rudy winces badly.

                                     RUDY
                         He had some points to make...

               Ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, 
                         stay right here --

                                     RUDY
                              (near-delirium)
                         All I wanted... was to make it home... 
                         for a little of Dad's turkey, and 
                         Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's 
                         acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry 
                         buns...

               Ashley has leapt to the bathroom. She brings wet washcloths 
               back to clean and dress --

                                     ASHLEY
                         We'll get there, baby... we'll get 
                         there...

                                     RUDY
                         ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in 
                         five whole years...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. 
                         You haven't had cranberry buns in 
                         two years.

               She kisses him softly. Rudy meets her eyes. Staring to get 
               his bearings back...

                                     ASHLEY
                         You saved my life.
                              (beat)
                         You could have run, but you didn't. 
                         You saved me.

                                     RUDY
                         You saved me.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I saved you because I love you, Nick.
                              (smiles)
                         Why'd you save me?

               Rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still 
               weak and distant:

                                     RUDY
                         Guy I was in with... car thief... I 
                         used to read your letters to him. I 
                         know they were private... I know, 
                         but... you spend twenty-four hours a 
                         day with somebody, you gotta talk, 
                         y'know? You gotta share. Or the room 
                         gets even smaller.
                              (beat)
                         And sometimes, I'd be reading them, 
                         and he'd close his eyes, get a smile 
                         on his face... and I'd know somewhere 
                         inside he was pretending you were 
                         writing to him -- He'd see your face, 
                         your pictures on the wall...
                              (beat)
                         Some nights I think he fell in love 
                         with you, too.

               Rudy touches a hand to her hair.

                                     RUDY
                         You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley.  
                         And with hope, there ain't nothing 
                         you can't survive.

               Ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his 
               chest.

               Rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. She kisses him 
               tenderly. Lingering.

               And this time Rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her 
               neck.

               Her eyes flutter closed.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...

                                     RUDY
                         Don't say my name...

                                     ASHLEY
                         I love you, Nick...

                                     RUDY
                         Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.

               Ashley hesitates. Carefully strokes his chest. He's still 
               kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (a small frown)
                         I love you...

               As he returns to her lips, mouths joining. Ashley's eyes 
               close again, as they fold into each other...

               ...and move slowly, tenderly, back to the floor.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN HOTEL - DUSK

               A bitter cold sunset. Through a room's window, Rudy and Ashley 
               lie tangled in sheets on the carpet.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM

               Ashley nestles against him. Rudy stares skyward. Hard.

                                     RUDY
                         They'll have guns.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         You said they've run guns, in their 
                         trucks. So they'll have guns. To do 
                         this robbery. They'll have serious 
                         guns.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I don't know...

                                     RUDY
                         We'll need one.

               Ashley frowns. There's a new look in Rudy's eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm going to have to be inside that 
                         casino. When it happens. I'll need 
                         to be part of it. I can't just be 
                         drawing some map.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick, what are you talking about?

                                     RUDY
                         We need to find a way to make me 
                         part of it.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Part of... with them?

               Rudy meets her eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         If we're helping them with their 
                         robbery, we're gonna be doing more 
                         than just walking away. Like that's 
                         some Christmas bonus.

               He nods, scheming the way he's always known.

                                     RUDY
                         You want him outta your life? You 
                         want a real New Year to look forward 
                         to?
                              (bravely)
                         If we're gonna do this... we're gonna 
                         do it to get it all.

               INT. KNIGHTS INN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at 
               a booth, singing along to "Good King Wencelas."

               In the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court. 
               Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing:

                                     PUG
                         Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten 
                         packs a day like you. His lungs got 
                         so black they couldn't find 'em with 
                         an x-ray.

                                     MERLIN
                         That right? Shit. I used to run rigs 
                         for a guy loved your chaw there. 
                         Shit rotted out his tongue, had to 
                         build him one outta silicon so the 
                         poor boy could talk. You ever see a 
                         motherfucker with a silicon fucking 
                         tongue?

               The Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad.

                                     PUG
                         Hell. The guy from Joliet, those 
                         black-ass lungs were the least of 
                         his problems. Got so much smoke in 
                         him his lungs couldn't even hold it. 
                         Got into his system, man. Into his 
                         blood. Coming out his ears, man, 
                         coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking 
                         the row, smoke'd be puffing out his 
                         skin.

               The Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs, 
               takes another drag.

                                     MERLIN
                         This trucker? Met a girl in a bar 
                         one night, she didn't know his 
                         situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, 
                         they get to mackin' hot and heavy 
                         and the woman swallows it. His tongue. 
                         Sucks it right down.

                                     PUG
                         My guy would walk into a room, set 
                         off the goddamn sprinklers.

                                     MERLIN
                         His lips went next. You ever see 
                         some silicon-fucking-lips?

               The Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance 
               over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub:

                                     MERLIN
                              (with disgust)
                         Vegetarians...

               Behind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten, 
               leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced.

               Rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. 
               Gabriel throws down the casino map:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Start singing.

                                     RUDY
                         I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum-
                         pum-pum

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sing it in pictures, Nick.

               Rudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge. 
               For the first time, he's giving the orders:

                                     RUDY
                         What you gotta worry about first is 
                         the guards. Place doesn't look much 
                         richer than when I worked there, so 
                         let's figure you're gonna have to 
                         deal with ten of 'em. There'll be 
                         two on the floor, walking the room, 
                         that leaves eight up above. Eyes in 
                         the sky. They see something up, 
                         they're the ones who'll hit the silent 
                         alarm and you're fucked.

                                     MERLIN
                         How do we take them out?

                                     RUDY
                         You gotta get someone upstairs.

                                     MERLIN
                         How do we do that?

               Rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:

                                     RUDY
                         Across from blackjack, there's a 
                         security doorway. Keypad access.

                                     GABRIEL
                         What's the code?

                                     RUDY
                         Uh... they change it every month. I 
                         wouldn't know.
                              (beat)
                         If there's trouble on the floor, 
                         you'll get security coming through. 
                         what you gotta do, is get inside 
                         that doorway once they do. You gotta 
                         draw 'em out.

                                     PUG
                         Without having them hit the alarms.

                                     RUDY
                         I got an idea on that one. Once you're 
                         up there, you gotta hold those guards 
                         down till some backup can get there. 
                         There's a security camera room that 
                         videotapes everything. You've gotta 
                         destroy every last one of those tapes.

                                     MERLIN
                         What about the money?

                                     RUDY
                         You lock down security, you move 
                         behind the cage. You hit the Count 
                         Room. There'll be a guy in there but 
                         he's got no guns; room's accessed by 
                         another code. Cashiers'll know it. 
                         They'll have alarms.

                                     JUMPY
                         What about the Powwow Safe?

                                     RUDY
                         What?

                                     JUMPY
                         The Powwow Safe. The secret safe.  
                         You said the manager's got a safe in 
                         his office where he hides skim money.

                                     RUDY
                         Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. 
                         Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.

               His confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his 
               eyes. Rudy quickly grabs the map again:

                                     RUDY
                         So. You're gonna need a man through 
                         here, two men at the cage, one to 
                         cover the count. You're gonna need a 
                         lookout outside, a sweeper through 
                         the back, and a gun guarding the 
                         front.
                              (beat)
                         You need six.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We got five. Putting Ashley outside.

                                     RUDY
                         You need six.

               Gabriel eyes him darkly.

                                     GABRIEL
                         NO.

                                     RUDY
                         You go in with five, you're either 
                         leaving an alarm free or an exit 
                         free. Someone hits an alarm, you're 
                         fucked. Someone gets to a phone, 
                         gets outside, 'cross the street, 
                         whatever, you're fucked. You need 
                         six.
                              (nods)
                         Six is me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No.

                                     RUDY
                         You guys get caught, I go away for 
                         good. I got an interest in making 
                         sure you don't. You need a sixth man 
                         covering an exit. What're you gonna 
                         do about it.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Yeah. What're you gonna do about it.

               She puts an arm around Rudy, smiles. That's her man.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I want a map of that security level.  
                         Every room, every guard, every thing.

                                     RUDY
                         Six men means six guns.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No way.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm no threat without a gun.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No, you're not.

                                     RUDY
                         There'll be people in that casino.  
                         I can't keep them from leaving if I 
                         don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, 
                         Monster... but I gotta be a threat.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What's the matter, Gabriel? This is 
                         what you wanted him for, isn't it?

               Gabriel's eyes don't leave Rudy's.

                                     GABRIEL
                         No gun.

                                     RUDY
                         Well. What you guys have to plan 
                         out, then... is how you're going to 
                         get to that cage and that security 
                         level before anybody realizes 
                         anything's wrong. Running in with 
                         ski masks and bullets flying ain't 
                         gonna do it.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That part, Nick... was planned out 
                         the day I read your letters.

                                     RUDY
                         What. We all gonna dress up like 
                         cowboys?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.

               Gabriel smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not on Christmas Eve.

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT CLOSE ON STORAGE LOCKER

               Pulled open to reveal FIVE SANTA CLAUS SUITS, hanging side- 
               by-side. Red polyester coats and pants, white felt trim and 
               black buckles, black boots and red caps.

               WIDEN TO REVEAL TRAILER

               As Gabriel lifts a Santa Claus suit and presses it against 
               Rudy. Ashley, Merlin, Jungy and Pug look on.

                                     RUDY
                         You gotta be kidding me.

                                     GABRIEL
                         'Tis the season, convict.

               He puts the suit back in the locker, pulls another. Finding 
               Rudy's size.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Can't be attracting attention, right?

                                     RUDY
                         What, we walking in there and 
                         delivering toys?

               He turns to see Merlin open another locker. This one stacked 
               with rifles, carbines and handguns.

                                     MERLIN
                         Hell yeah.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON SKETCH

               of a floor plan, a sheet of paper overlaid on Gabriel's map 
               of the casino. A pencil draws a boxy room and labels it 
               "Security Video Room." Then an eraser wipes it out.

               WIDEN TO REVEAL RUDY

               still cuffed to the bedframe, pulled close to a desk. He's 
               sitting, working on the security level map.

               The door opens; Ashley enters, looking worried:

                                     ASHLEY
                         He wants to see your map.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm almost done.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He says he wants it now.

                                     RUDY
                         If he wanted a photographic memory, 
                         he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working 
                         on it here.

               Ashley walks over, puts her arms around his neck. Whispers:

                                     ASHLEY
                         How are we gonna do this, Nick?

                                     RUDY
                         You're the getaway girl. The money's 
                         gonna get to you eventually. Gonna 
                         be my job to be the guy who walks 
                         outta there with it. But I can't do 
                         that without a gun. Any luck talking 
                         to him?

                                     ASHLEY
                         Bullets or no bullets, he won't do 
                         it.

                                     RUDY
                         Is there any way you could get into 
                         his truck?

                                     ASHLEY
                         No.

                                     RUDY
                         We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...

               Rudy studies his map, then quickly pencils in the "Security 
               Video Room," in a totally different place than he drew it 
               before. Hands the paper to her.

                                     RUDY
                         Here's the Picasso. Is he in his 
                         room?

                                     ASHLEY
                         They all are. Football's on.

                                     RUDY
                              (nods, thinks)
                         Keep 'em there for a little while.

               Ashley takes the map, frowns. Rudy kisses her gently.

                                     RUDY
                         We're gonna get you out of Detroit, 
                         Ash. Get you out of beauty and 
                         fragrances.
                              (smiles, then)
                         Remember that. After all this is 
                         over, when you know me, when you 
                         really know me... remember it was 
                         me.

               She searches his eyes, not quite understanding. But smiles. 
               Rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. Ashley slips out.

               When she's gone, Rudy stands and turns to the window. Outside, 
               the Blazer with the "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long" bumper 
               sticker still sits parked.

               Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the 
               game room darts, flecked with blood.

               HE GIVES IT A SOLEMN STARE

               INT. RUDYS ROOM - MOMENTS L&TER - NIGHT

               Rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. He 
               tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped 
               end, furthest-from the tip. Four protruding metal edges.

               He finds the Phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to 
               work the dart-end into the grooves. It scrapes and jags, but 
               with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.

               The screw starts spiraling out.

               ANGLE ON BEDFRAME

               As two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle 
               handcuff off the frame.

               ANGLE ON CLOSET

               As Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips 
               the paper off, untwisting the wire.

               ANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW

               As Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.

               Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window 
               into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He 
               stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.

               AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER

               Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and 
               gear boxes in the back seat.

               He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and 
               slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming 
               it around until it trips the door lock.

               The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --

               INT. BLAZER

               -- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning 
               knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade.

                                     RUDY
                         Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta 
                         be keeping a gun...

               He rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of 
               pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing.

               Some HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, 
               pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. 
               And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing

               MERLIN AND JUMPY

               stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way 
               toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.

               ON SCENE

               Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.  
               Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.

               Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, 
               heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances 
               back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem 
               to. They stand at the Nova, talking.

               Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs 
               turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. 
               He slips around the corner, out of sight.

               AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL

               Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving 
               toward a side entry --

               -- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.

               Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling 
               water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this 
               wall.

               Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.

               Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. 
               Because his breathing has stopped.

               INT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

               Rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads 
               "Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty."

               Rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The 
               small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an 
               unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --

               It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling 
               and splashing someone offscreen --

                                     ASHLEY
                         ...and he's saying "We're not gonna 
                         help him just to walk away. If we're 
                         gonna help him... we're gonna get it 
                         all...

               She splashes again. Taunting --

                                     ASHLEY
                         ...he wants to help now, he wants to 
                         rob it now we could probably stay 
                         right here, he'd go on and rob it by 
                         himself --

               As Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward 
               her in the pool.

                                     GABRIEL
                         He wants the money.

                                     ASHLEY
                         No, baby. He wants me.

               Gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles.

                                     ASHLEY
                         He wants... your "sister"...

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...whoever she is.

               And they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. 
               A steamy embrace.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Nick Mason's gonna help us more than 
                         we ever dreamed.

               ANGLE ON RUDY

               in the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness.

               IN THE POOL

               Gabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow.

                                     GABRIEL
                         All those letters are about to pay 
                         off, baby... all those letters...

                                     ASHLEY
                         To all those cons...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Searching for a money man...

                                     ASHLEY
                         We musta written what, twenty of 
                         'em? And they were before this guy.  
                         One, two letters apiece, ten to the 
                         racetrack guy in Leavenworth --

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- till he fucked his parole --

                                     ASHLEY
                         -- plus the forty to Mason... how 
                         many letters is that?

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's a book, baby.
                              (presses closer)
                         That's a book of love.

               They kiss again. Gabriel strokes her wet hair:

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can't take watching you touch him.  
                         I can't take his hands on you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         One more day, baby. One more day to 
                         Christmas.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I've been doing good, though.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Didn't have to hit me so fucking 
                         hard. Didn't have to throw me outta 
                         the goddamn truck.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Didn't have to send me down a fucking 
                         mountain.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What, he should see me help you catch 
                         him?

               ON RUDY

               still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.

                                     ASHLEY (O.S.)
                         He's shown us the setup, he's drawn 
                         us the map, he's helped us do the 
                         plan. He wants a gun, give him a 
                         gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, 
                         but give him the gun. The more 
                         manpower we've got in there, the 
                         better. He won't try and make his 
                         move till the money's in hand.

                                     GABRIEL (O.S.)
                         He'll be dead when he does.

               BACK IN THE POOL

               Gabriel and Ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Y'know something, baby? If you were 
                         my sister? I'd still want to wake up 
                         Christmas morning with you...

                                     ASHLEY
                         Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be 
                         the tinsel round your tree...

               And as their words turn to moans and murmurs...

               IN THE SHADOWS

               Rudy is gone.

               INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell 
               on his way toward the "Exit" sign posted above a door. He's 
               almost there, marching fast --

                                     RUDY
                         Here's my present to you, truck 
                         drivers --

               AS THE EXIT DOOR OPENS

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Where the hell's Gabriel?

               -- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as 
               Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside.

                                     JUMPY
                         With his girlfriend. Making up for 
                         "Nick" time. I'm going down to the 
                         bar, you want something?

                                     MERLIN
                         Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on 
                         our convict.

               They separate, Jumpy down the hall, Merlin to the stairs --

               INT. STAIRWELL

               Merlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight 
               down.

               Checks the hall for Jumpy, then races out --

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the 
               same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free 
               the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.  
               Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --

                                     RUDY
                         Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a 
                         bike, it's like riding a bike!

               But there's nothing. The engine won't start.

               INT. STAIRWELL

               Merlin reaches the second floor, steps into the hall.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, 
               the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.

                                     RUDY
                         How far you gonna get, Rudy...

               Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced 
               to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an 
               shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.

               And his eyes find the Blazer.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin ambles the corridor. Approaching Rudy's room.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake 
               down. Forces the gearshift into "Reverse."

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the 
               key.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding 
               on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front 
               bumper.

               The wheels start to move.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle 
               but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key.

                                     MERLIN
                         My room.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs 
               ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space 
               below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up 
               speed, rolling on its own.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his 
               feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, 
               the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --

               -- getting two roof-steps worth of running start --

               -- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --

               -- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right 
               through the window to his room --

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM

               -- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a 
               somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet.

               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL

               The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash --

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM

               -- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly 
               on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. 
               Spreading a deck of cards out before him.

               Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up.

                                     RUDY
                         Hey.

               Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The 
               window's open. Rudy continues his card game.

               Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut.

               Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, 
               heart pounding. The cards go flying.

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks 
               outside... and stops still. In parking lot...

               ...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's 
               seat. It's Merlin. Now watching.

               Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches 
               the falling snow. Caged again, after all.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

               Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back 
               in.

               Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket 
               over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My 
                         love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve...

               Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile.

               A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her 
               smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...

               INT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY

               CLOSE ON DESK CLERK

               In a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully:

                                     SMILING DESK CLERK
                         Hello, gentlemen. And how can we 
                         help you on this holiday morning?

               CLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG

               Three grim faces.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Checking out.

               EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY

               The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards 
               Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their 
               car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces 
               overnight.

               Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. 
               Rudy hits the snow --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Gabriel!

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's for the hundred bucks worth 
                         of pay-per-view.
                              (then KICKS him)
                         And that's for the two hundred you 
                         took outta your minibar.

                                     RUDY
                              (chokes, pained)
                         You guys were paying for the room, I 
                         just figured --

               Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at 
               Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --

               -- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's 
               face.

               It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (cruel smile)
                         You wanted a weapon, convict? You 
                         got one.

               Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and 
               Pug haul him up. With venom:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Merry Christmas-Eve.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with 
               Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG

               Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and 
               Jumpy.

               Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Commit this thing to memory. Every 
                         guard, every exit... don't tape it 
                         to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. 
                         That's the Gospel right there. The 
                         Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and 
                         John...

               Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes 
               his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her.

               He smiles right back.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering 
               Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands."

               INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE

               The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.

               Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons 
               chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.

               A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.

               Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.

               Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.

               A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa 
               coat.

               AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.

               A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.

               And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.

               EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK

               Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the 
               empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa 
               Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic 
               tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.

               RUDY AND ASHLEY

               sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots, 
               cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Where should we go, Nick? When we're 
                         gone from here... where should we 
                         go...

               The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several 
               fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:

                                     PUG (O.S.)
                         Okay, who had the cheeseburger with 
                         bacon; what about a roast beef, I've 
                         got two roast beefs here --

                                     JUMPY (O.S.)
                         Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         I got a bacon too; there another 
                         bacon in there?

                                     PUG (O.S.)
                         I got a bacon for him and a bacon 
                         for me; there's four cheeseburgers 
                         and two roast beefs --

                                     MERLIN (O.S.)
                         Somebody better give me something 
                         with some goddamn bacon --

               As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.

               Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.

                                     RUDY
                         This time right now... Dad's stacking 
                         wood out back, getting ready for 
                         tomorrow. Little blaze in the 
                         fireplace. Mom's setting out the 
                         good silver, hanging her cinammon 
                         sticks, up in the doorways. Getting 
                         out her scratchy old records... 
                         singing along...

               Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.

                                     RUDY
                         I don't know where you're going.  
                         But I'm going home.

                                     ASHLEY
                         We go together, Nick. Wherever... we 
                         go together. Remember?

                                     RUDY
                         Well. I'm going home.

               GABRIEL

               sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white 
               cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast 
               beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a 
               savage bite.

               Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes.  
               Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.

               ON FULL SCENE

               The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures 
               scattered, watching day turn to night...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - NIGHT

               The neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights 
               now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a 
               dozen cars in the parking lot.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

               Filled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only 
               two FAT WOMEN sitting at them. Three INDIANS at a poker table. 
               An OLD TIMER in his 90's playing blackjack.

               INT. SECURITY LEVEL

               A ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level 
               through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up 
               centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs 
               to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.

               Jack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a 
               battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the 
               bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY, 
               watching the lack of activity below:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         And all through the house... not a 
                         creature was stirring...
                              (sighs)
                         Why don't you go ahead and send most 
                         of your guys home, Ed.

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas.

               The boss smiles, heads off. Jack Bangs swigs his brandy, 
               eyes his high-tech security gear glumly:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Hell. Nobody even comes here to 
                         cheat...

               EXT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

               The Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley 
               inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling 
               stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Go.

               Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.

               Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road.

               [NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end, 
               are in their Santa Claus suits.]

               RUDY AND JUMPY

               make their way across the lot, heading for the entrance.

                                     RUDY
                         Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you 
                         something. You have any problem with 
                         the fact that we're on our way to 
                         take millions of dollars from an 
                         Indian casino?

               The Native American considers. As they walk:

                                     JUMPY
                         Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's 
                         gone a long way toward restoring 
                         wealth and pride to communities who've 
                         been economically isolated and 
                         enslaved for centuries. Stronger 
                         infrastructure, better schools, higher 
                         employment... they're all the results 
                         of reservation casino success stories. 
                         Still, many natives believe that 
                         these are temples to a godless 
                         materialism and greed that will only 
                         infect the souls of indigenous peoples 
                         until their love of money has 
                         destroyed the spiritual values their 
                         ancestors died to protect and their 
                         homelands have become no different 
                         from any United States suburb, 
                         satellite city or industrial park.  
                         Destroying the Indian legacy once 
                         and for all and leaving behind a 
                         nation of selfish, angry natives, of 
                         which I, it's true, am one --

               -- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors --

               INT. TOKAHAWK - NIGHT

               -- and SLAM inside, stumbling into each other, suddenly 
               LAUGHING and slapping backs. Surveying the casino:

                                     RUDY
                         Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!

               Rudy spreads his Santa arms wide and whoops. Jumpy laughs 
               with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred:

                                     RUDY
                         Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY- 
                         MONEY!

               The few gamblers inside look up at the commotion. Bear the 
               Bartender. Two CASHIERS and one WAITRESS. Ed the Security 
               Boss strides over, smiling tightly:

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         How you gentlemen doing tonight?

                                     RUDY
                         We're out of work tonight, that's 
                         how! Christmas Eve! We're out of 
                         work!

                                     JUMPY
                              (shakes his hand)
                         Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's 
                         with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas 
                         the season...

                                     RUDY
                         We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, 
                         but we got charitable donations!

               Rudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket, drops some to the 
               floor. Jumpy retrieves them --

                                     JUMPY
                         ...bunch of us got together for the 
                         union party. Hey, how late are you 
                         open?

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                              (eyes on the money)
                         All night and all day.

                                     RUDY
                         I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress 
                         Civil Defense Fund! Are there any 
                         representatives here present?

               A Waitress sidles close; checks with the Boss. He nods okay.

                                     WAITRESS
                         What can I get ya, Santa?

                                     RUDY
                         Santa drinks American beer.

                         What's your game, guys?

                                     JUMPY
                         Blackjack. Got a buddy from 
                         Woolworth's out parking the sleigh.

               The Security Boss stares him down. Then:

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Good luck, gentlemen.

               He steps aside and indicates the tables. Jumpy claps him on 
               the back, pushes Rudy on through the slots.

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT

               Gabriel's truck at the roadside, hazards on, with signal 
               triangles as if broken down. Gabriel places the last one, 
               hurries back down the casino road.

               EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA - NIGHT

               Ashley sits between Merlin and Pug. Gabriel jogs by the car.

               Ashley checks her watch:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Three minutes.

               INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT

               Rudy and Jumpy sit at a blackjack table, beside the Old Timer.

               Jovial ad libs as the Waitress brings Rudy's beer. Rudy 
               doubles down, busts, and gets belligerent:

                         RUDY
                    (to the Old Timer)
                 That was my card, pop! 
                 My card! You hit for 
                 my card!

                         OLD TIMER
                 I... sorry, Mister...

                         RUDY
                 That was my king!

                         OLD TIMER
                 Well...sorry...

                                                       JUMPY
                                                  (to the Waitress)
                                               How are you tonight?

                                                       WAITRESS
                                               Fuckin' freezing. What can I get ya, 
                                               Santa?

                                                       JUMPY
                                               Jack and Coke.

                                                       WAITRESS
                                               Want that Jack and Coke or Jack and 
                                               Pepsi? 

               Behind them, Gabriel SLAMS through the casino doors.

                                     JUMPY
                         Woolworth's!

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart!

                                     JUMPY
                         Saved you a seat, man. Get in on a 
                         hand here!

               Gabriel sidles to the table, claps Rudy on the back.

                                     RUDY
                              (re: Old Timer)
                         Careful. Watch out for this guy.

               They throw chips in. The Waitress circles around:

                                     WAITRESS
                         What can I get ya, Santa?

                                     GABRIEL
                         American beer.

               The Old Timer hits and stays. Rudy hits and busts:

                                     RUDY
                         POP! That was My card!

                                     OLD TIMER
                         But... I had a five...

                                     RUDY
                         You're hitting for MY cards!

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Ashley's eyes on her watch. Nods to Merlin and Pug:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Go.

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Jumpy has left the table, sidling to a change booth, glancing 
               at his watch. Passes a $100 bill:

                                     JUMPY
                         Could Fat-Man-With-Flying-Horse get 
                         some quarters, please?

               AT THE BLACKJACK

               Gabriel slides off his stool, punches Rudy in the shoulder:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank.

               Rudy nods, slugging beer. He's becoming an unruly drinker. 
               The Old Timer motions to hit; but before the Dealer can pull 
               the card, Rudy slams the table, points to it:

                                     RUDY
                         That is my card, guy. My card.

                                     DEALER
                         He hit, mister.

                                     RUDY
                         He didn't hit.
                              (to Old Timer)
                         You didn't hit. You're not hitting.

                                     OLD TIMER
                         But you don't even know what it is!

               The dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. Then hits Rudy and 
               busts him. Rudy stares darkly.

               IN THE HALL TO THE BATHROOMS

               Gabriel walks to the men's room door. Then stops. Adjusts 
               the rifle under his red coat. And turns back.

               AT THE CHANGE BOOTH

               Jumpy is handed a bucket of quarters.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

               Merlin and Pug march toward the entrance, hands in pockets.

               INT. SECURITY LEVEL

               The Security Boss returns upstairs, beside Jack Bangs, who's 
               watching the video monitors. On one screen, a parking lot 
               cam shows Merlin and Pug approaching:

                                     VIDEO GUARD
                         There's two more coming.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Hell, there we go. That's the spirit.

               He drunkenly clinks his battle to the Security Boss, wassail. 
               The Boss frowns.

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Jack? Is there a union for department 
                         store Santas?

               INT. TOMAHAWK - ON BLACKJACK

               Rudy bolts up suddenly, sends chips and his chair to the 
               carpet.

               Points sternly at the Old Timer, slurring:

                                     RUDY
                         Switch seats with me.

                                     OLD TIMER
                         What? No...

                                     RUDY
                         You're taking my money. Switch seats 
                         with me. Switch seats with me if 
                         you're not taking my money --

                                     OLD TIMER
                         I'm ninety-two years old --

                                     RUDY
                         Then get yourself another table!  
                         You're hitting Santa's cards and 
                         you're taking Santa's money!

                                     OLD TIMER
                         There is no other table --

                                     RUDY
                         THEY'LL OPEN ONE!

               Rudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his 
               might,

               OVERTURNING IT, cards, chips, cash scattering --

               AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE

               Two SECURITY GUARDS at the door (?) rush for Rudy --

               Gabriel steps from the restroom, hall, moves toward the keypad 
               door to the security level --

               Jumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage --

               Rudy tackles the Old Timer, fists and false teeth flying, as 
               the Guards arrive, trying to wrench him off the poor guy --

                                     RUDY
                              (hard whisper)
                         Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down!

               As Gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door --

               IN THE SECURITY LEVEL

               The Security Boss grabs more men, while Jack Bangs merely 
               smiles at the sight. Guards wrestling a drunken Santa:

                                     SECURITY BOSS
                         Help them down there! HELP them!

               IN THE CASINO

               Three guards CHARGE out of the keypad door --

               -- right past Gabriel, who slips deftly inside --

               AND UP THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE

               -- opening his coat, pulling his assault rifle --

               GABRIEL

               Right at the top of the stairs, right at the top of the 
               stairs...

               -- charging to the top, starting right and running SMACK 
               into a wall.

               He spins, sees the doorway's on his left --

               TO A PRIVATE HALLWAY

               with three doors. Gabriel stops at the first, grips his gun --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Video room, video room --

               -- and swings open a closet bathroom. He frowns, confused. 
               Jumps to the second door --

                                     GABRIEL
                         Map said video room --

               -- and swings open a storage closet. Gabriel grumbles, leaps 
               to the third door and flings it open,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Map said goddamn video room!

               TO REVEAL THE MAIN SECURITY AREA

               -- with two Guards sitting at their posts, and Jack Bangs, 
               the Security Boss and the Video Guard in the doorway to the 
               video room. Which is on the far opposite side of the space.

               As they turn to see the furious Santa Claus with the AK-47 --

                                     GABRIEL
                         WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!!

               -- as he SPRAYS the ceiling with GUNFIRE.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR

               Where the RIFLE sounds, just as Jumpy grips his bucket of 
               quarters at the cashier's cage and wheels --

               -- throwing a fragmentation grenade's worth of quarters at 
               the two Cashiers! Bits Of metal flying between the bars. 
               They SCREAM, stepping backwards in defense --

               -- and Jumpy whips a sawed-off shotgun from his coat --

                                     JUMPY
                         Step BACK from the desks!

               AT THE BLACKJACK

               The five guards wrestling Rudy spin and scramble, pulling 
               pistols from shoulder holsters as --

               MERLIN

               CHARGES through the casino entrance, shotgun held --

                                     MERLIN
                         DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!

                                     RUDY
                              (from the floor)
                         DROP THE GUNS! NOW!

               But the guards don't. Whirling on Merlin --

               -- who OPENS FIRE, BLASTING two of the guards off their feet. 
               Rudy stays on the ground, covering his head, holding the 
               petrified Old Timer down --

               -- as the other three guards FIRE back, forcing Merlin to 
               race behind the slots. BULLETS rip into slot machines --

               -- as GUNSHOTS ring out from the casino restaurant. Two of 
               the Guards spin to look behind them as --

               -- PUG storms in, contorted glee, twin pistols BLAZING, 
               popping a steel flurry into an outgunned Guard.

               Merlin spins from hiding behind the slots. He and Pug both 
               OPEN FIRE, blowing away the two remaining men from both sides.

               One of the guards falls in front of Rudy, gun in hand --

               -- but as Rudy-reaches for the guy's pistol --

                                     MERLIN
                         Hold it right there, Nick. Your squirt 
                         gun's all you need.

               Merlin steps to him, gun aimed. He and Pug collect the Guards, 
               weapons.

                                     MERLIN
                         Cover 'em.

               Rudy gets to his feet, pulls the water pistol from his pocket.

               Moves to round up the Old Timer, the waitress, the Poker 
               Players and the Fat Slots Women.

                                     RUDY
                         Sorry, guys. But what the hell were 
                         you doing here an Christmas Eve 
                         anyway.

               INT. SECURITY LEVEL

               The two Guards lie on the floor, with Security Boss and Video 
               Guard. And the ruined Jack Bangs.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         No... not here... please... mister...

               Gabriel storms to the video room's doorway. Slams a new clip.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm 
                         begging. This is not some card club, 
                         'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an 
                         international gaming destination. 
                         We're in guidebooks. You can't do 
                         this... you can't do this to me...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Show's over.

               He OPENS FIRE, BLOWING AWAY the wall of monitors and VCR's 
               recording the robbery. SPARKS and METAL fly.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Ashley waits in the Nova, checking her watch. Behind her a 
               RED WRANGLER rolls in and parks. A FIRE CHIEF and his DEPUTY, 
               just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.

               Ashley sinks low, panicked. Presses her HORN. The firemen 
               spin around but don't see her. They shrug. Keep walking.

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               Rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar. Onto 
               the floor with Bear the Bartender, whispering hard:

                                     RUDY
                         Get down and stay down, and you're 
                         gonna be fine. Just don't do anything. 
                         My friends are disturbed --

               The hostages do as told. Rudy breathes relief, squirt gun in 
               hand. And then stares at the array of bottles around him.

               IN THE CASHIER'S CAGE

               Merlin and Pug force the cashiers to the floor:

                                     PUG
                         What's the security code to the Count 
                         Room?

                                     CASHIER #1
                         Security code? What security code?  
                         You just use a key!

                                     PUG
                         NICK SAID SECURITY CODE!

                                     CASHIER #1
                         Who's Nick?!

               Pug bangs the guy's head off the floor, stalks to the Count 
               Room door. Just a key lock. Pug BLOWS it away with his guns, 
               kicks the door open --

               -- and gets SHOT TO HELL by three COUNT MEN inside, pistols 
               blazing! Pug puppets, dead. A wad of chaw hits the ceiling.

               Stunned Merlin FIRES BACK.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               -- as the Firemen hear the GUNFIRE, pulling holstered pistols --

               INT. TOMAHAWK

               -- while Merlin dives out of the cage, joining Jumpy, taking 
               cover as the Count Men FIRE AWAY --

               -- as Rudy scrambles back from the bar --

                                     MERLIN
                         You said no GUNS in there! NO GUNS!

               Merlin and Jumpy leap up, GUNS BLAZING, firing through the 
               cage bars at the Count Men. Killing all three just as --

               THE OFF-DUTY FIREMEN

               storm through the doors, pistols ready --

                                     FIREMEN
                         DROP IT! DROP THE GUNS!

               Merlin and Jumpy are caught. Trade a look. And let their 
               weapons fall, turning just as --

               THE CHEVY NOVA

               CRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen!

               The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots 
               send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino 
               floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray.

               Ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares 
               darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care.

                                     ASHLEY
                              (wild-eyed)
                         WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!

                                     RUDY
                         Yeah. That's love.

               She storms on by. The slots pay off behind her.

               INT. COUNT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Jumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room. 
               There are stacks and stacks of bills.

               Ashley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks.

                                     ASHLEY
                         MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

               Merlin, meanwhile, slams Rudy against the wall:

                                     MERLIN
                         You knew there were guns in here!

                                     RUDY
                         Merlin, I didn't know --

                                     MERLIN
                         You got Pug killed! You tried to get 
                         ME killed! You just lost your Get-
                         Outta-Jail-Free --

                                     RUDY
                         I promise you, I didn't know!

               As Merlin puts a gun to Rudyls head --

                                     GABRIEL (O.S.)
                              (over casino speakers)
                         Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa 
                         Claus... would you please bring our... 
                         mapmaker... to the security level?

               Merlin stares daggers at Rudy. Shoves the gun away.

               INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - NIGHT

               Gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. 
               The taped jingle of slots still plays.

               Poor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood 
               runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock:

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas... I can't... 
                         go back...

                                     JUMPY (O.S.)
                         What the hell is with this place?  
                         Thought the video room was back there --

               Merlin and Jumpy lead Rudy in. Ashley follows. They carry 
               bulging money sacks. Gabriel stares Rudy down.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I told you not to fuck us with that 
                         map, Nick. I told you not to, and 
                         you did. How am I s'posed to keep my 
                         promises now?
                              (Ashley joins him)
                         How's she s'posed to keep hers?

               He kisses her hard. Sloppy. Grins.

               Then points to Jack Bangs:

                                     GABRIEL
                         He won't tell us where it is. The 
                         Powwow Safe.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I don't know... what you're...

               Gabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle. CRACK.

                                     GABRIEL
                         THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW 
                         SAFE!

                                     JACK BANGS
                         What... Powwow...

                                     GABRIEL
                         The Powwow Safe where you steal your 
                         money! Where you cheat your Indians!

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I don't steal any --

               Gabriel CRACKS him again. And again. Rudy winces. Gabriel 
               grabs Rudy, pulls him over.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We 
                         KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you 
                         work! Because WE know who's worked 
                         for you!
                              (smiles)
                         Remember a guy named Nick Mason!?  A 
                         security guard named Nick Mason!?

               Gabriel pushes Rudy's head toward the desk. Jack Bangs, 
               drooling blood, eyes swollen, turns his face to see.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Nick... Mason... ?

               Jack Bangs stares at Rudy. Rudy stares back.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         ...so where is he?

                                     GABRIEL
                              (laughs, mocking)
                         Where is he?! Where is he?!

                                     JACK BANGS
                         He's not Nick Mason...

               The smile fades from Gabriel's face.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         Nick Mason... worked for me two years 
                         ago. This man...
                              (a spark of recognition)
                         ...he's some cowboy...

               Gabriel grabs Rudy, slams him against a wall. He glares at 
               Ashley for answers. She stares in disbelief.

               Rudy meets her eyes.

                                     RUDY
                         Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley.
                              (shrugs)
                         Story of your life.

               BACK TO GABRIEL:

                                     RUDY
                         I did time with Nick Mason, Monster.  
                         Told you that from the start.

               Ashley's putting it all together...

                                     ASHLEY
                         You... you... YOU --

                                     RUDY
                         We still gonna spend Christmas 
                         together?

               Ashley CHARGES him. Gabriel stops her; Merlin and Jumpy help 
               hold her back. Gabriel spins on Rudy with his rifle:

                                     GABRIEL
                         You are lucky, convict. You're 
                         spending Christmas with the birthday 
                         boy himself --

                                     RUDY
                         Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!

               Gabriel hesitates. Doesn't fire.

                                     RUDY
                         I did time with Nick Mason, remember?  
                         I knew he worked here, didn't I!?  
                         Well, some shit he told me!

               Rudy steels himself for the shot. It still doesn't come.

                                     RUDY
                         Nick told me his manager kept a safe 
                         in his office, his stealing safe. 
                         His Powwow Safe. I swear, please...  
                         Nick told me.
                              (looks to Jack Bangs)
                         Behind the liquor cabinet.

               Jack Bangs dully meets Rudy's eyes.

               Gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves. 
               They split in the middle. And there is a combination safe 
               mounted in the back. Gabriel turns to Jack Bangs:

                                     GABRIEL
                         Open it.

               He pulls him off the desk. Jack Bangs wavers, struggling. He 
               looks at Gabriel. Then at Rudy.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I can't go back to Vegas...

                                     GABRIEL
                         OPEN IT!!!

               Jack Bangs steps to the safe. Spins the lock. Spins back. 
               Spins forward. Click. Jack Bangs looks at Rudy.

                                     RUDY
                              (nods)
                         Pow. Wow.

               And Jack Bangs opens it --

               -- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the 
               safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of WEAPONS that lies 
               inside, Jack Bangs already has an Uzi in hand --

                                     JACK BANGS
                         VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!!

               BULLETS as he turns back to the room --

               -- sending Gabriel, Ashley, and Merlin diving for the floor! 
               Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead --

               -- and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino --

               Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --

               -- BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering 
               the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk --

                                     JACK BANGS
                         I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! 
                         I CAN'T! GO BACK!

                                     GABRIEL
                         GO!!!

               He and Ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out 
               with two of the money sacks --

               TO THE CASINO FLOOR

               -- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --

               Jack Bangs keeps FIRING, into the casino, SHREDDING the tables 
               but missing Gabriel and Ashley -- as he JUMPS right after 
               them.

               BACK IN BANGS' OFFICE

               Merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking 
               for Rudy --

               -- just as Rudy slams into him. Merlin's SHOT hits the 
               ceiling.

               The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the 
               parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs 
               one, just as Merlin kicks out, leaping up --

               -- and freezes, seeing Rudy's got a pistol on him.

               Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --

               -- and a thin stream of water shoots out. Leaving a stain on 
               his shirt. It's the water pistol. Rudy stares blankly.

               As Merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off 
               the floor. Rudy's dead to rights.

                                     MERLIN
                         Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in 
                         this...

               With the gun on Rudy, Merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.

               Pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --

               -- and hesitates. Sniffing the air. Looking down.

               At the stain on his shirt. His lighter still lit --

                                     RUDY
                         Me too.

               -- and Rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching 
               Merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a ARC OF FIRE! 
               He's filled alcohol in the gun!

               FLAMING LIQUOR shoots into Merlin's face and eyes. He drops 
               the handgun. Rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading 
               the fire down his neck and chest. Merlin howls wildly --

               -- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --

               OUT THE PARKING LOT WINDOW

               -- and CRASHING down on the hood of a Pontiac, head through 
               the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. Flames flickering.

                                     RUDY
                         Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

               IN THE CASINO

               Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in 
               with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward 
               them, still FIRING and babbling.

               Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, 
               but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering 
               the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, 
               slamming it into reverse --

               -- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, 
               into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.

               Jack Bangs stops shooting.

               He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, 
               gun still raised.

               Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. 
               He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, 
               face. The uzi drops to the ground.

               A silence. Even the slots have stopped.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm sorry.

               Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor 
               man's empire. And gives a small shrug.

                                     JACK BANGS
                         That's why they call it gambling.

               He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He 
               takes a few wary steps toward the road --

               -- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind 
               him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Your turn.

               Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.

               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT

               The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in 
               reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley 
               collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.

               EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a 
               couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.

               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG

               Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks:

                                     GABRIEL
                         With the wrong fucking guy! We took 
                         the place down with the wrong fucking 
                         guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is 
                         that Christmas?!

               He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back --

               TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT

               Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God bless us every one...

               EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT

               A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a 
               grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been 
               no traffic here for awhile.

               The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. 
               Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is 
               fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.

               A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.

               Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer 
               gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer 
               to five feet away from, the ravine drop.

               IN THE CAB

               Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --

               TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE

               -- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is 
               in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with 
               a can of gasoline.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You almost got away with it, Santa. 
                         Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your 
                         car, got halfway to Canada till you 
                         caught some ice in the road. By the 
                         time you hit bottom down there, whole 
                         car was burning like a comet.  Musta 
                         burned up all that money too.

               Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls 
               of bills into the car.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Buncha guys in red suits busted in, 
                         they'll say. Started shooting. They 
                         won't be able to remember... if it 
                         was three, or four... or five. Four 
                         dead Santas and some burned-up cash. 
                         Merry Christmas, The End.

                                     RUDY
                         Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it 
                         hers.

               Gabriel smiles at him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         She told me 'bout the convict 
                         magazines. Had to figure there'd be 
                         some boys in the pen with some useful 
                         knowledge. With nobody to talk to. 
                         Nobody to listen. So we stocked up 
                         on stationery.

               Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hard life being a trucker's girl.

               Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.

                                     RUDY
                         I saved your life.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You shouldn't have.

                                     RUDY
                         He did love you, you know. Nick. He 
                         did love you.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Who wouldn't.

               So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.

                                     RUDY
                         Maybe this is where you wanted him, 
                         Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, 
                         dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. 
                         Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause 
                         what you did for him was make him 
                         the happiest held ever been. You 
                         showed him hope and taught him mercy.  
                         And he died a peaceful man. You wanted 
                         to destroy some convict... and all 
                         you did was save his soul. Remember 
                         that. Love your money and remember 
                         that.

               Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:

                                     ASHLEY
                         Merry Christmas, Rudy.

                                     RUDY
                         I'm glad it was me.

                                     ASHLEY
                         Merry Christmas.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get in the car.

               Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops 
               at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get in the CAR!

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know my name...

               He turns back to Ashley.

                                     ASHLEY
                         What?

                                     RUDY
                         Rudy. How'd you know my name?

                                     ASHLEY
                         What are you talking about?

               Rudy looks at Gabriel. He's frowning. To Ashley:

                                     RUDY
                         You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I... you told me your name was Rudy. 
                         You told me a million times, back in 
                         the truck, telling me you weren't 
                         Nick --

                                     RUDY
                         No --

                                     ASHLEY
                         You were screaming you weren't Nick! 
                         And we just didn't fucking believe 
                         you!

                                     RUDY
                         But I never said Rudy.

                                     ASHLEY
                         You said it a million times!

                                     RUDY
                         I never told you my name.

               He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ash?

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know my name was Rudy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ash?

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know my name.

               Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --

                                     ASHLEY
                         Men.

               -- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.

               Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of 
               shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley, 
               incredulous.

               She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel 
               falls still.

               Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.

               Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare 
               each other down for a long moment, before:

                                     RUDY
                         Where is he.

               A silence.

               No one moves.

               And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of 
               the trailer. And WHISTLING. "Silver Bells."

               A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon 
               steps into Rudy and Ashley's view.

               It's Nick Mason.

               Alive and well.

                                     NICK
                         Merry Christmas, Rudy.

               Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.

                                     NICK
                         I missed you, beautiful.

                                     ASHLEY
                         I missed you too, Nicky baby.

               They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of 
               him, embracing happily. Then turns to Rudy:

                                     ASHLEY
                         For your information. I never fuck 
                         the wrong guy.

               Rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.

                                     NICK
                         Oh, hey. Have you two been properly 
                         introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy 
                         Duncan, I did almost a year with him 
                         in the Mountain. Read him all your 
                         letters, talked about you all the 
                         time, made him feel like he really 
                         knew you.
                              (turns to Rudy)
                         My friend... wantcha to meet Millie 
                         Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha? 
                         My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked 
                         at that bar in Motor City, where I 
                         manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't 
                         talk about her much once the Ashley 
                         letters started coming, I guess.

               Rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.

                                     NICK
                         Millie here used to serve drinks to 
                         these gunrunning truckers, real big 
                         talkers, talking bout a real score 
                         one day. I was in the Mountain, man, 
                         what the hell, why not let her get 
                         friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em 
                         an idea she had, 'bout writing guys 
                         in prison. Getting one who could 
                         show 'em a sure thing.

                                     RUDY
                         She set them up. All of them.

                                     NICK
                         Why not have her pretend to find me?  
                         Pretend to write me and reel me in?  
                         Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose 
                         as some sister of his named Ashley?

                                     RUDY
                         And you set me up.

                                     NICK
                         Always wanted to rob that casino, 
                         Rudy. Way back when I worked there.  
                         What better way than to get some 
                         guys to rob it for me.

               Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer:

                                     NICK
                         Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the 
                         shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does 
                         he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty 
                         to put out the story I was dead. 
                         Once the wound healed up...
                              (notes cash-sacks)
                         Got out of the Mountain this morning.  
                         And tonight I'm a rich man.

                                     RUDY
                         How'd you know I'd do it.

                                     NICK
                         Do what?

                                     RUDY
                         Walk outta there and tell her I was 
                         you.

               Nick looks back at Ashley.

                                     NICK
                         Because every time I read her letters, 
                         Rudy... you listened.
                              (to Ashley)
                         Keep your gun on him.

               Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and 
               lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.

                                     NICK
                         Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, 
                         Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll 
                         say. So we gotta have five Santas 
                         not walk out. Gotta have five...
                              (working)
                         This'll burn right away... in the 
                         fire...

               Nick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs.

                                     NICK
                         Hell, you never needed to convince 
                         Ashley you were me. Just the dumb 
                         fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked 
                         enough about the Tomahawk in the pen 
                         for you to get by --

                                     RUDY
                         Talked about the old man's weapons 
                         stash, probably forgot I'd remember

                                     NICK
                         Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if 
                         you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd 
                         start convincing 'em soon enough.

               Nick slams the car door, locking Rudy in.

                                     NICK
                         They had the weapons and the 
                         willpower. We just gave them their 
                         inside man.

                                     RUDY
                         You gave them me.

                                     NICK
                         I gave them me.
                              (shrugs, smiles)
                         Said some nice things about me, Rudy. 
                         I appreciate it. But don't worry. I 
                         do love her. And she loves me. You 
                         had that right all along.

               Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car 
               into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:

                                     NICK
                         Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!

               Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick 
               steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.

               IN THE CAR

               Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his 
               wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of 
               his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --

               -- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The 
               switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to 
               his right wrist!

               Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through 
               the Santa belt --

               -- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either 
               Ashley or Nick to see --

               IN THE TRAILER

               Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick 
               is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --

                                     NICK
                         Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time 
                         with you!

               IN THE CAR

               The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of 
               trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, 
               RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!

               As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races 
               over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the 
               dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --

               -- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate 
               the right leads --

               IN THE TRAILER

               Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the 
               flaming car to the trailer's edge --

               -- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --

               -- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --

               IN THE CAR

               Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --

                                     RUDY
                         LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A 
                         BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!

               -- and the ENGINE IGNITES!

               Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and 
               looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him --

                                     RUDY
                         RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND 
                         THE WHEEL!

               -- and SLAMS the accelerator.

               ON FULL SCENE

               As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back 
               into the trailer --

               Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --

               -- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's 
               legs between metal and metal!

                                     ASHLEY
                         NOOOOOOO!!!

               Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."

                                     RUDY
                         RULE TWO!

               Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. 
               She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --

               -- and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp --

               -- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --

               -- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her 
               onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off 
               the ridgetop --

               -- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking, 
               blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.

               The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CASINO/EXT. SNOWY ROAD - MONTAGE

               The same four shots that opened the film. The Santa on the 
               floor of the cage (Pug), the Santa on the hood of the car 
               (Merlin), the Santa in the hallway (Jumpy).

               And the Santa lying face-down on the snowy road. Gabriel.

               EXT. RAVINE'S EDGE - SAME

               The last of the opening images. Rudy's motionless Santa 
               figure, upside-down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit 
               still aflame. He opens his eyes.

               ANGLE ON SNOWY ROAD

               Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at 
               Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.

               Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist 
               down.

               He's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:

                                     NICK
                         ...Rudy... help me... Rudy...

               Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.

               He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the 
               truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.

                                     NICK (O.S.)
                         ...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!

               The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine.

               Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom. 
               He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.

               And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.

               He stares at them.

               A long time.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RUDY'S JOURNEY - MONTAGE - NIGHT/DAY

               In his burnt and battered Santa suit, Rudy's figure trudges 
               the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty 
               roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads "Sidnaw -- 
               35 Miles."

               He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes 
               across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the 
               soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of "The Little 
               Drummer Boy" start to rise --

               With snow falling, he passes a new sign: "Sidnaw -- 27 Miles."

               With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window, 
               seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway. 
               Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.

               -- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into 
               mailboxes. At every-stop on the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               A cul-de-sac of Norman Rockwell Michigan homes. Graced with 
               pines and a pristine snowfall. Christmas trees in windows, 
               lights on inside, figures of FAMILIES in holiday gear.

               No one noticing the man in the Santa suit, his sacks long 
               gone, walking up the road.

               EXT./INT. FIFTIES-ERA HOME - DAY

               At cul-de-sac's end. Where a blackened red cuff KNOCKS.

               After a moment, the door opens to reveal a smiling MOTHER 
               and FATHER in their sixties. There's a party going on inside; 
               a dining table visible beyond them.

               The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock. Concern.

                                     MOTHER
                         Rudy...? Rudy?

                                     FATHER
                         Son? Is... is that you...?

               The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them.

               The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room, 
               finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden 
               with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and 
               wine.

               The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.

               The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.

               Yes, it's Rudy.

               Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes 
               a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings, 
               and sets it in front of him.

               And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.

               His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The 
               other relatives look likewise.

               All staring at Rudy.

               Then, while he eats, without another sound...

               ...the Mother takes her seat at the table...

               ...and the Father pulls up another chair.

               They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.

               There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of 
               glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals.  
               CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to 
               the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.

               There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle 
               Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage 
               Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and 
               her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue...

               ...and at the head of the table...

               Rudy Duncan.

               Home for Christmas.

               CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END

                            RETURN OF THE APES

                              by Terry Hayes

                                first draft

                                   1996

DEEP SPACE.

No atmosphere, no life, nothing. Just a web of lights- a billion stars hang
in a velvet void. The only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind.

The light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet. We see ragged
continents and oceans wreathed in cloud. This is earth rise. Our world
spins slowly in space, a thing of beauty, of awesome majesty. In all this
nothingness - life.

We push in on the planet - in to the Americas. The wind grows louder -

A PUEBLO VILLAGE.

A broken-down pick-up bumps into a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe
houses, blinding flurries of dust and sand. The pick-up stops in front of a
crumbling church. A man in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag. This is
the DOCTOR. '

A WOMAN'S FACE.

Screaming. She's very young - a South American Indian - lying on a bed in a
corner of one of the houses. She is in the final throes of childbirth, a
sheet draped over her loins. The Doctor works between her legs, encouraging
her in Spanish.

The local PRIEST, not long out of the seminary, crouches at her side
counting off the beads of a rosary. He looks like he is about to pass out.

SUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP. A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES
DOWN HER CHIN. THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD
-

DOCTOR

Arriva!

He lifts the child from her loins, but it makes no sound. We don't see the
baby - just the shock on the Doctor's face. The mother struggles up to see
her child.

The Doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it. He
thrusts the bundle into the Priest's hands.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

(in Spanish)

Dead - the child is dead. Now go!

We hold on the mother's anguished face. Dissolve to

A HELICOPTER

Off the roof of a tall hospital building. As it rises up into the night we
see a red cross painted on its side. It's an air ambulance.

The chopper turns away. The Manhattan skyline, every skyscraper a blaze of
lights, opens up behind it. The chopper swoops over the Brooklyn bridge and
into the night.

GROVE OF TREES

Winter's coming on - every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold. The
helicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately
tended lawn. Surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great
university. Harvard.

Two paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a
stainless steel casket onto a gurney. They wheel it fast towards one of the
buildings. As they go' through the front doors, we hold on a sign etched
into the stone

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY

A PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS

slide a long cylindrical "key" into the stainless steel casket. We pull
back to reveal the casket lies in a sealed, uncontaminated room. A group of
people in lab coats -scientists and researchers - stare through the glass
walls.

A young TECHNICIAN, working at a console, keyboards in a series of
commands.

Sswhish. The top of the steel casket swings open. Clouds of white gas
stream out -whatever's inside has been nitrogen cooled.

The gas clears. Lying inside is the body of a newborn child - except that
the baby has the skin, the face and the features of a man of eighty. The
scientists and the researchers react - shocked.

One of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby. In its fingers it
holds a long steel scalpel. This is the highest-tech autopsy you've ever
seen. The scalpel drives down, about to open the chest cavity -

BLOOD SPRAYS

But not from the baby's chest - it's in glass vials, exploding as white-hot
flames consume them. A plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted against
the flames, is emptying hospital waste into a furnace. He slams the door
shut.

He turns we see his face. He's in his 4Os, handsome in a rough-hewn way - a
strong jaw and a muscular body. There's a cool intelligence in his eyes,
but a two-day beard and a worn-out uniform make him look like a man who,
between youth and middle-age, lost his way. And so he has. His name is WILL
ROBINSON.

He takes a steel trolley, wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of
sight.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN

features the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy.
She's in her 30s - attractive, long hair left loose on her shoulders, an
air of authority about her. Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She is a
Professor of Biology.

We tilt down from the screen. It hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory
-overhead lights, rows and rows of wire animal cages. Moving down death
row, feeding the lab animals, is Will Robinson.

TWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS, CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE, TURN AND STARE
AT HIM. SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HE'S HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS
CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE TURNS AND LOOKS -

DIAMOND

The exact cause of death is still unknown. What is certain - we're dealing
with something we've never seen before. Every organ in the body is
affected...

Superimposed over Diamond's face is a three dimensional, computer-generated
graphic of the baby's body.

Will forgets about what he's doing. He walks towards the screen. We push in
on it. Screeds of new data appear

Vascular System ...............Atrophied

Neurological Function .........Senile dementia

We hold on Will's eyes - he stares at it.

AN AUDITORIUM

Billy Rae Diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing. About forty
scientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly-lit lecture hall.

Diamond is even more impressive in person - she is tall and gracious but
you don't become a Professor at Harvard' at her age without having an iron
will and a sparkling intelligence. She speaks with great authority -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

The baby in question, Michael James Flanagan -she points at the
computer-generated graphic on a huge screen

was born at New York Hospital yesterday.

MAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -

DIAMOND

But the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has received similar reports
from a village in Bolivia, two cities in Australia, seven countries in
Europe, a cluster of cases in Namibia and Mexico. Forty-two cases in all.

As she speaks, pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations.
They dot their way across the entire globe. Dr Diamond turns to face her
audience-

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Like Michael Flanagan, they were full-term babies. Two hundred and seventy
eight days since conception and yet, by all reasonable medical standards,
they have completed their entire life cycle. They have gone from conception
to death, not in three score years and ten, but in slightly less than nine
months. Michael Flanagan died of old age.

Silence as Diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it. On a
balcony high above, another man is taking notes. He sits alone, almost
hidden in shadow. It's Will Robinson.

SHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR

Will crouches in front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town.
It's night, the place is deserted. He slips a rusted key into a padlock.
Snapl The key breaks.

Will curses. He grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it. He
slides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers. The padlock
springs open.

SPIDERS

weave a web in a corner of the storage unit. A work light hangs from the
ceiling. Will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago. He puts
together a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks.

PULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT, UNSURE WHAT'S ON IT. HE TAKES A
CASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK, SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES "PLAY"A HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AS IT DIES, WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE. IT'S WILL, SPEAKING
FROM YEARS AGO -

WILL

(on tape)

I would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor...

We push in on Will's face as he listens to himself...

WILL (CONT'D)

have had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues. I'm
privileged to also call them my friends -

A shadow of pain crosses his face. He shuts off the tape and sits
motionless.

LAFAYETTE PARK

Night. Homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a
coming storm. Across the road, the first drops of rain splatter against the
White House.

A string of Government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in
front of the West Portico. From inside, we hear a man's voice -
well-spoken, authoritative

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

There's no mistake - you're sure?

JEFFERSON LIBRARY

Diamond sits in the President's study - book-lined walls, a fire in the
hearth. A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of
Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is
littered with graphs end files.

DIAMOND

We've got five thousand cases now, Mr President. That's in three weeks. The
number is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours.

The President stands near a window, half in shadow, the firelight playing
across his face. He's in his 50's but the strain of office makes him look
older.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

That's a geometric progression, sir. In three months there'Il be over seven
million cases. After that we hit the wall -

She pushes a thick, bound volume across the table.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

According to this, there won't be a live birth on the planet.

The President looks at her for a moment. Then he reaches down and picks up
the bound volume. It's hundreds of pages of numbers and projections.

PRESIDENT

These are just computer projections -

species don't disappear that fast.

DIAMOND

Tell that to the dinosaurs, sir.

He looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

What date - when exactly do we hit this wall?

DIAMOND

Six months and twenty-one days.

Silence. The President keeps looking out the window.

PRESIDENT

Can't somebody tell me - what exactly are we dealing with. Is it a virus or
what?

DIAMOND

We don't know, sir.

The President turns to the Chief of Staff.

PRESIDENT

Whatever they need, Bob - anything. Harry Truman put together the Manhattan
Project - you understand?

The Chief of Staff nods his head - yes.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

(softly)

A world without children -it's inconceivable. And what about the rest of us
- what do we do? Just sit and watch our species die? Will the last person
to leave the planet turn out the lights.

Silence again. Finally a young woman - the White House Press Secretary -
speaks.

PRESS SECRETARY

We're going to have to manage the public. Right now, the truth may be
inoperative -

PRESIDENT

Of course we're going to have to manage itl We're going to have to manage a
whole lot of things. But can't we take at least one moment to be human?

He looks around the room. We hold on their somber faces.

A CHEAP APARTMENT

Through the window - the neon sign of a gas station. This is Will's place,
He lives alone - a bed in the corner, run-down furniture, dishes in the
sink.

The kitchen table has been turned into a desk - Will sits at an old
computer, surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks. He
stares at the screen - the notes and equations are blurred. He's been at
this so long, he can barely focus. He rubs his hand across his eyes.

A small mewing sound. Will turns to an alcove in the corner - a cat lies in
a basket, panting. Will goes to her.

She's giving birth - the first of her new-born kittens lies next to her.
Will strokes the mother's head, looking at the miracle of new life. He puts
his fingers in a water bowl, about to moisten the mother's mouth.

Then he stops. He looks again at the kitten - there's two of them now. A
beat as he just stares -

WILL

(softly)

Jesus Christ... of course!

A LUXURIOUS BATHROOM

Through frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower.
Whoever she is, she's got a great figure. The sound of a doorbell. The
shower door opens -Diamond sticks her head out. She looks at a clock - it's
almost midnight.

VIDEO ENTRY PHONE

A video screen monitors the front door. On it we see Will - his hair
tousled, an old overcoat buttoned to the neck, a battered briefcase under
his arm.

Diamond - a towel around her shoulders, hair dripping - picks up the phone.

DIAMOND

Who is it?

WILL (O.S.)

Will Robinson.

DIAMOND

I think you have the wrong house.

WILL (O.S.)

I work at the department.

He turns and looks straight into the camera. Instinctively, Diamond covers
her breasts. She looks at him - recognition dawns.

AN ELEGANT ROOM

Will and Diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse - wooden
floors and beautiful rugs. Diamond doesn't wear any make-up -just jeans and
an oversized shirt. She looks even more beautiful. It does nothing to ease
Will's nerves. He's got his briefcase open in front of him, speaking from
sheaves of notes and papers.

DIAMOND

(interrupting)

Hold on - how do you know about the case load? The Government's trying to
manage this - they've withheld that information.

WILL

The Internet, Doctor. It's a highway - you can ride it anywhere you want. I
got into 'the Center for Disease Control. I had a look at their raw data.

DIAMOND

Jesus. Do you know what you're doing? This is the White House we're talking
about.

WILL

(Heated))

No, it's a disease and it doesn't come any worse than this - that's what
we're talking about.

HE LOOKS AWAY, CALMING HIMSELF. HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES. HE SPEAKS AGAIN,
QUIETLY -

WILL

I've listened at the lab - I think I know where you're looking. Bacterias
mostly, but there's a strong push into the retro-viruses. You're wrong,
Doctor.

DIAMOND

Really - and I thought I was arrogant. But then, I'm just a professor.

WILL

No virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex.

DIAMOND

I can think of one.

WILL

Sure, it can start in pockets but it never stays there. This thing does. It
only affects women of child-bearing age. What - it's so smart it can
recognize motherhood? I don't think so. No, this is into the very heart of
what we are. This is genetic. This is part of the DNA.

DIAMOND

Thank you. A hundred thousand genes make up human DNA - that really narrows
it down.

WILL

As a matter of fact it does. There's only one part of the DNA that's passed
exclusively through women. Thirty-seven genes, the oldest part of the human
organism -

DIAMOND

(realizing)

The mitochondrial DNA.

WILL

Over the years there's been speculation -not all of it crazy either - that
somehow it triggers aging, He slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from
scientific journals across the table. She doesn't pay them any attention -
she's thinking.

DIAMOND

You realize what you're saying, don't you? A bacteria - I think we'd get it
for sure. A virus -you'd have to say we've got a chance. But say you're
right. The mitochondrial DNA - that's so far out on the frontier, we can
barely see it.

WILL

Like I said - it doesn't get any worse than this.

She keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table. A
beat.

WILL (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

DIAMOND

Sure.

WILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -

WILL

Shit. You're pregnant, aren't you?

DIAMOND

Nine weeks.

THEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS, TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT. SHE GETS TO
HER FEET -

DIAMOND

Do you want a drink - coffee, a sandwich or something?

WILL

(Recoiling)

No...no, I'm fine thanks.

Watches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered
briefcase.

AN EMPTY STREET

It's late at night. Will clutches his briefcase under his arm, heading
home. A bitter wind blows out of the north. He looks a lonely and forlorn
figure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the
streetlights.

CONVOY OF N.A.S.A. TRUCKS

RUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING. THE TRUCKS,
DOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS, TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD.
THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES. WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW
IN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -

HAND HITS A TABLE

IT'S DIAMOND - SHE'S ANGRY. BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHE'S IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. SHE GLARES AT AN
ARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -

DIAMOND

It's just an idea, Bob. All we're doing is taking it for a walk around the
block.

A man in his 60s - distinguished, diplomatic - intercedes.

DE MAUPASSANT

There was a lot of work done on it in the 7Os. I can't recall the details
but someone had the idea that mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory.
If you could unlock it, you could physically travel back down it. Through
evolution - like a time machine.

BOB

Wowl Those 70s, man. I'm really sorry I missed them.

Everyone - Diamond included - laughs.

OLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT

They hang on the wall of a tiny room - not an office, just a
hole-in-the-wall Will has turned into his own. He sits at a table, making
notes. A knock - Diamond enters.

DIAMOND

I thought you'd like to know - we're looking at mitochondrial DNA,

WILL

Thanks for telling me.

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE
WHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -

DIAMOND

Is that you?

She points at a man in his 20s standing on the deck in one of the photos,
Will nods.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Seattle. Is that where you went to school?

Will hesitates - we sense that he doesn't really want to answer.

WILL

No. Princeton.

DIAMOND

Expensive.

WILL

A scholarship. Then I did some post-graduate work... I never really
finished.

Something in the way Will says it - some sense of loss - makes Diamond
pause. She recovers and looks in her wallet. She pulls out a photograph and
hands it to Will. It shows a small sailing boatgaff-rigged and a varnished
hull.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's a Kestrel 24 - I haven't seen one of those in years. She's a beautiful
boati

DIAMOND

My grandfather left it to me. I don't sail it much any more - it's too hard
to find a for'etd hand.

WILL

What about your husband - doesn't he sail.

DIAMOND

I don't know - I haven't met him yet.

WILL LOOKS AT HER. HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT? SHE SHRUGS -

DIAMOND

I wanted a baby but I'm thirty-four-years old. Sooner or later you realize
that somewhere along the way you've missed the man you've been waiting for.

WILL

What did you do - ask a friend?

DIAMOND

I thought of it.

WILL

Lucky friend.

DIAMOND

I went to a clinic. Not exactly romantic, but it worked.

(pauses)

Good idea, bad timing.

WILL

How many people have you put on the mDNA?

DIAMOND

Seven.

WILL

That's all?!

DIAMOND

That's all I can spare. It's just a theory -one of dozens of theories.

Will looks away in disgust.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What is it with you - it's not just science is it? Why are you so
passionate about this?

WILL

I know I'm right. It's a mutation. A hundred thousand years it's probably
been lying there -shifting, weaving into the mDNA. You either go back and
change evolution or you engineer it out. Seven peopleYou might as well
shoot peas at a dam.

DIAMOND

You haven't answered my question - why so passionate?

WILL

The question's not relevant. The only thing I'm interested in is the
science.

He turns back to his work. We hear the door close as Diamond leaves.

A GEODESIC DOME

White, space-age, is being erected on the lawn. Workmen are unloading the
NASA trucks. We pull back through a high window of the Biology building. A
woman stands there, looking out. Her name is KRIS McQUADE. This is her
office -

MCQUADE

You want to tell me what's going on?

She turns and looks at Diamond, sitting on the other side of the desk,

DIAMOND

Don't ask, Kris, I'd have to lie and I don't want to do that to my best
friend,

MCQUADE

The rumor is, you've done something really big. They say the Defense
Department is taking it over.

Diamond just sits there, staring straight ahead. McQuade waits. Finally -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

Okay, okay - I'm sorry I asked. So what about this guy - what's he done?

DIAMOND

He hasn't done anything - I'm just interested.

MCQUADE

Ten thousand employment records I've got on file and you want to know about
a lab assisant?

DIAMOND

The smartest assistant I've ever known.

MCQUADE

What - he can mop and fart at the same time?

She picks up pages from a computer printer - including a copy of Will's
photo I.D.

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

He's handsome, at least I'll say -

(a thought strikes her)

Jesus - you're not interested in him like that, are you?

DIAMOND

No, but he's the most unbelievable smelling man.

MCQUADE

Smelling? You're pregnant - obviously your hormones have gone crazy. What
exactly does he smell like?

DIAMOND

You know...

(searching for the right word)

.., wholesome.

MCQUADE

Of course he does - that's the Lysol.

Diamond laughs but McQuade barely notices it. She's leafing through WiU's
file -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

That's strange - there's supposed to be a background sheet. Family, school
-all that shit. It must have gotten lost.

Before Diamond can say anything, a young man enters. He's McQuada's
assistant.

ASSISTANT

Your secretary's on the line, Dr Diamond. There's a call for you.

DIAMOND

Tell her to take a message.

ASSISTANT

It's the New York Times.

MCQUADE

What do they want?

DIAMOND

I think Washington's news management just went south.

THE WHITE HOUSE

Night. Scores of television news vans are parked outsideDutch, Japanese and
French reporters are doing stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings of
ABC.

JENNINGS (O.S.)

We're standing by to go live to Washington as events continue to unfold on
this remarkable day. I don't think there's a person anywhere who's not
sitting by a radio or television now. I'm told the President is on his way
to the press room -

FIFTH AVENUE

is totally empty - just a young man on rollerblades. He skates effortlessly
down the deserted avenue - past Tiffany's and the Trump Tower, all silent
now.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

My fellow Americans...

The rollerblader passes the cathedral of St John. The front doors are open.
Someone is playing the organ - Mozart's Requiem. The rollerblader fades
into the night.

STEEL DOOR OPENS

A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a
vaulted basement. All we can see are silhouettestowers of crates, racks of
equipment...

CARETAKER

This used to be the basement of the Psychology Department. We just sort of
stacked everything around 'em -

He flicks a switch - the storage room floods with light. He points at two
long iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged up to a series of
valves and pipes.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

Flotation tanks. They used 'em for experiments in sensory degradation -

WILL

Deprivation - sensory deprivation.

CARETAKER

Yeah, well - whatever.

SHAFT OF LIGHT

WILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS. HE DROPS
INTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD, EXAMINING IT. THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM. HE
STARES AHEAD. VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

Now I know what a mole feels like -

YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)

(lightly)

It feels like a fucking coffin, that's what it feels like.

Other voices laugh. They're all young and like the young they think they'll
never die.

CARETAKER (O.S.)

Hey, fella - what are you doing?

HE'S PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH. WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST. HE
TURNS -

WILL

Just looking. I'll be coming back - I'll need a key.

The caretaker shrugs - sure. Will climbs out of the tank.

WILL (CONT'D)

One other thing - don't tell anyone, huh?

CARETAKER

Who would I tell? They treat me like shit Worse than shit. All work, no
appreciation. The phantom of Harvard. Someone should write a fucking
musical about me.

CIRCLES OF LIGHT

Desk lamps, glowing in an office. Diamond and a team of researchers are
working through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers.

RESEARCHER

Here's another one - "Mitochondrial DNAA Map to the Past."

DIAMOND

Who's it by?

RESEARCHER

Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant.

DIAMOND

Jesus, what did this guy do - write the book on it? Who is he?

HUGE BOOK BEING OPENED

It's a scientific directory. The researcher flicks the pages and stops at
"Plant".

RESEARCHER

Wow - I thought your career was impressive.

Diamond looks up from her reading.

RESEARCHER (CONT'D)

Degrees in medicine and microbiology. A PhD at 24, a member of the Academy
of Sciences, published twenty times by 1974...

DIAMOND

And then?

RESEARCHER

Then nothing.

DIAMOND REACTS. SHE GETS TO HER FEET, COMING CLOSER -

DIAMOND

Where did he go as an undergraduate?

RESEARCHER

Princeton.

DIAMOND

On a scholarship?

A CORRIDOR

It's late at night. The scientists and their staff are working around the
clock. Will wheels a trolley laden with bottles, vials, and catheters down
a crowded corridor. Diamond pushes through the people behind, trying to
catch up to him. Scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Robert!

Will keeps walking, heading for an elevator. Diamond skirts around a knot
of people.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Doctor Plant!

Will hesitates - one split second - then keeps going. The elevator doors
slide open. Will steps in, turns and hits a button. He watches Diamond
pushing towards him. For a moment their eyes meet. She comes closer.
Sswhish! The doors slide shut.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

She sits behind her desk, listening to the chief of campus security.

SECURITY OFFICER

The equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs. It includes a
range of genetic material-

(hands her an inventory)

We've checked all the buildings your team is using - he's not in any of
them.

DIAMOND

What about hie house?

SECURITY OFFICER

He asked his landlady to look after his cat. She hasn't seen him for three
days.

IN THE BASEMENT

there's a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to
it is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials.

Will is sit'ting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and
equations reel across them. The caretaker comes out of the shadows,
carrying two mugs of thick coffee. He puts one down next to Will -

CARETAKER

You wanna tell me what exactly you're doing?

WILL

Looking for a date.

The caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the
screen -

CARETAKER

What's wrong with a calendar?

WILL

These are chemical sequences - they represent human genes. By following a
trail of mutations, I can date them. I'm trying to find out when a major
change occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA.

CARETAKER

The mitochondrial DNA? Yeah... well that makes sense.

But Will barely hears it. Suddenly he's leaning forward, keyboarding in
complex commands. The caretaker watches him -

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

You've found it?

WILL

Maybe...

He has illustrations of two long-chain molecules on the screen. He moves
them together. Aa they overlap, we see they're not identical - the tail of
one kicks upwarda. Will starel at it -

WILL (CONT'D)

(softly)

Yeah - I've found it.

CARETAKER

So - what's the date?

Will presses a key. Faster than the eye can follow, the first long-chain
molecule starts to shift and mutate. Finally it resolves itself into the
second molecule. Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -

WILL

The best computer science can do? One hundred and two thousand years ago.

CARETAKER

Sort of what I figured - give or take a day or two.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a
page -there's a photo of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three
colleagues. He's got his arm around one of them - an attractive young
woman.

Diamond lifts the photo, looking at it more closely. She starts to read the
caption. We push in on it and hold on the words... "UC Berkeley".

WE ARE FLYING

swooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs,
tumbling streams and primordial forest. There's something unreal about it -
we pull back to reveal they're computer-generated images, playing on the
screens in the basement.

The caretaker has pulled up a chair. He and Will are watching the images
generated by a CD-ROM.

WILL

This is someone's version of the prehistoric world. I'm interested in the
geography, the atmosphere -that sort of stuff.

CARETAKER

Where are we?

WILL

Africa - that's where Mankind started.

Will keeps looking at the strange images. The caretaker gets to his feet -

CARETAKER

I'll see you in the morning.

WILL

Yeah.

The caretaker limps towards the door. Will looks up -

WILL (CONT'D)

Thank you - for helping me, I mean.

CARETAKER

It sounds like you're leaving or something.

WILL

No. I just wanted to say it, that's all.

The caretaker keeps looking at him -

CARETAKER

What exactly are you doing? You're a bit old to try and make your mark,
aren't you? Anyway, nobody listens to people like us.

WILL

Fate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a second chance. Do you know what
it's like to be ridiculed, to have your ideas thrown back in your face? And
that was the easy part. I guess that's what I'm doing - I want to prove
that I was right.

CARETAKER

You're lying to me.

WILL

What do you mean?!

CARETAKER

You are going somewhere. I don't know where it is. I'm not even sure I can
imagine it. Good luck, though. I hope you find whatever it is you're
looking for.

WILL

Thanks.

CARETAKER

No point in getting you breakfast, huh?

Will shakes his head - no. They smile at each other. The caretaker turns
and goes.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk. Her
Secretary stands in the doorway -

SECRETARY

I've got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone. She runs the archives at Berkeley.

DIAMOND

(into phone)

Ms Wilkins?

We push in tight on Diamond's face as she listens. Anxiety and alarm
register on it.

OUTER OFFICE

The security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the
campus. Researchers and scientists have gathered in the office, rumors are
flying. Everyone turns - Diamond stands in the doorway to her office. She
looks at deMaupassant.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You were right, Luc. That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the
one that did it. He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail.
Within every one of us is the history of our race. It's imprinted on our
genes - like a map. Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back
down it. Through the womb. Through time and space -

(she looks at them all)

That's what he's doing. He's going back. He's going to try and change
evolution.

SECURITY OFFICER

Is that possible?

DIAMOND

He was the best of his generation. He thinks so. He's got the genetic
material for the key. All he needs are flotation tanks.

THE FLOTATION TANKS

The valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks.

Will sits next to the rack of medical equipment, beads of sweat on his
forehead. He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter. He
opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials. A cocktail of fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm. The
fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it.

A LONG CORRIDOR

Diamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs.
Ahead -a pair of swing doors -

BOB

A theory's one thing - do you really think he'll try it?

DIAMOND

He's spent fifteen years as a lab assistant. He lives in a two room walk-up
with a cat. No family, no friends. What's There's left for him here? Of
course he'll do it.

Smack! They push through the doors, into another corridor.

AN IRON LADDER

Will climbs up the side of the flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a
tremor, a rippling wave, passes from his feet to his head. It's his muscles
contracting. It wracks him with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.

Smash! The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get
in. Will looks up - the door twists and moves. His vision is starting to
distort. He grabs the access hatch and swings through -

Splashl He drops into the water. Clang! He closes the hatch.

Barn? The steel door flies open. The security officer lowers a sledge
hammer. Diamond steps in end throws a light switch.

DARKNESS IN THE TANK

Will floats on his back, the only sound is the rapid thump of his
heartbeat. The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into
spasms. We push along his body - up to his face. His eyes roll back into
his headl

All we see are the whites of them. They shatter into a web of capillaries -

WILL'S POV

red mist swirls in front of him. It resolves itself into a web of
interwoven tendrils -the double helix of the DNA molecule. Will starts to
travel through it -

INSIDE THE TANK

Will is morphing, shedding cells - we're losing him in the warm, dark fluid
of the tank. It's like the womb. His body seems to be disintegrating,
dissolving into it. Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once
were.

His hollow mouth opens. From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream.

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Not a sound escapes. The security officer is about to try and open the
hatch.

DIAMOND (O.S.)

NO!

The security officer turns - Diamond is holding the catheter in her hand.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

If we open the hatch, I think we'll kill him. It's too late - it's his
journey, he's going to have to take it.

INSIDE THE TANK

Will's body is like a shadow, almost one with the water, growing less
distinct by the moment. What is left of his face - a strange, shifting
shape - floats towards us. Closer... closer. It melts completely into the
water -

WILL'S POV

He spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it
shatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling
through the heavens. A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling
through space and time -

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Diamond and the others are gathered around the computers. Bob is working
the keyboard. Diamond is looking.through the piles of papers, notes and
star charts.

DIAMOND

Everything's here - he kept a record of every step. He can even tell the
date -forty hours after he arrives there's a solar eclipse.

BOB

Billie - there's a note for you.

Diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen. She reads what is
writ'ten -

DIAMOND

"I won't be here, but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them,
Billie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley."

THE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT

blaze through the heavens. They draw together, changing and reconstituting
into a shape we recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules. The
strands connect. A blast of light! It's the rays of -

THE SUN

streaming into a cave. Will lies in the fetal position, bleeding from his
nose and ears. The light grows stronger - it's dawn. Will drags himself up
and stumbles towards the entrance. We tilt up from him. He doesn't see it,
but we do - prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock.

A CRAGGY PEAK

Will steps out of the cave. Sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new -
plains and jungle and primordial forest. Rising above it is a snow-capped
mountain that looks like Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs across the earth -
a rift valley. Will stares at it. He raises his face to the sun. He did it.
The first step's over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the
valley is a tiny pillar of smoke.

A FOREST CLEARING

In the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp-fire. Will moves
cautiously towards it. He stops - several bodies, terribly mangled, lie on
the ground.

Will turns one of them over - he's got matted hair, a heavy brow and a
short, muscular body. As primitive as he is, there's no doubt of his
species. He is a man. A Paleolithic man.

This was a hunting party -scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of
dead animals lie nearby. For a moment Will thinks the hunters must have
been torn apart by wild animals. Then he looks up into the trees - more
bodies of the hunters. But no animal did this - they hang from iron chains,
left there as some sort of trophy. Or a warning.

CRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS

Will is following a tiny trail through the forest. He's taken what is
useful from the bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag, two
short-handled spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt. He moves on -
deeper into the shadows of the forest.

A SPARKLING STREAM

Will splashes through the crystal water. He looks upstream - a small lake.
A flock of strange birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of
pink and gold.

He steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of
over-arching trees. We hold on his feet - whip! He triggers something. A
net of woven vines engulfs him. He drops the spears and bedroll. Suddenly
he's soaring through the air.

He jerks to a halt - he's a netted animal hanging high in the trees. The
faces of two Paleolithic men, crouched on boughs, stare at him.

PLUME OF WATER

cascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge. Smoke curls up from fires.
Scores of stone-age people - man, women and children - turn and look. Will,
roped and bound, is being hauled into the encampment.

The primitive people - nervous but intrigued - circle around him. They are
dressed in skins and fur. talismans hang from their necks. The warriors
carry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads. It makes
them look even more savage.

Will is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit. A
pile of ivory tusks lie nearby. The two captors jerk on the leash - it
stops Will in front of a cave. Hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and
head of their totema saber-toothed tiger. This is the Tribe of the Tiger.

A man emerges from under its outstretched paws. He's in his late 20's -
proud and strong. His name is Kip-Kena - he is their leader. He and Will
look at one another.

Kip uses his hands to sign to Will in the formal language of his race. Will
stares at him - he has no idea what it means. He shrugs. Kip tries a new
tack - he speaks. The sounds are rough and guttural - but understandable,
KiP Where is your tribe?

Will pauses, searching for an answer- where do you start? He gives up.

WILL

I don't have a tribe.

A rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe.

KIP

No man can live without a tribe! How would he hunt the mighty animals? Who
would keep his fire burning?

WILL

I come from far away... I'm a traveler.

KIP

What is traveler? Is that a tribe?

Again Will's at a loss. Something catches Kip's eye. He reaches forward and
rips the water bag out from under Will's coat. The tribe reacts -

KIP (CONT'D)

You carry things taken from our hunters! Kill him.

He turns away. Will throws himself at him -

WILL

NO!

Whackl A blow to the back of Will's neck knocks him to his knees. He looks
up -two warriors have their spears raised, about to plunge them into his
chest.

A sound like thunder - it's hooves. The warriors turn. Will follows their
gaze - half an army, mounted on horseback, surges into the gorge, They are
heavily armed, dressed in armor but it's not their weaponry that astonishes
Will. These are apes!

The tribes-people scream in terror. They turn and run. The two warriors
forget about Will. He dives for cover in a pile of rocks. As he tears
himself free of the ropes that bind him, he looks out -

The apes charge in to the camp. At their head is a huge gorillarippling
muscles and intelligent eyes - deep set and yellow, like pissholes in the
snow. He wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver. His name is Drak. He
is the Lord of the High Rivers, supreme commander of the ape army. On
either side ride his elite Praetorian Guard.

Woo-woo-woo! Kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head. It's a
bull-roarer. The warriors of the tribe know its meaning - they rally to
Kip's side. Armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between
the apes and their panic-driven people, trying to buy them time to get into
the cave.

Sswhish! The sound of arrows. The apes carry triple-barreled iron
crossbows.

Short iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down. Dust and smoke swirls
across the camp. Kip and his men, fighting all the way, retreat towards the
cave.

A baby's cry! Will turns - a toddler sits at a hearth, left behind in the
confusion. Will half rises to his feet, about to go for him. Too late -
there's a blur of movement irt the trees. A tribe-boy - too young to be a
warrior - has come back for the child.

Out of the dust and smoke - Drak! Foam flies from his horse's mouth. He's
seen the boy and the child. He locks what looks like a Gatling gun tight
under his huge bicep.

Will screams a warning. The boy turns - he sees Drak as he fires. A hail of
iron darts - twenty or more - cut him and the child down.

Rage flashes in Will's eyes. He scrambles over a boulder and rips a
crossbow from a dead ape's hand. He slides bolts into the barrels and grabs
a lever with both hands -you need the strength of an ape to cock it. A
sound behind him - little more than a whisper. He swings -It's an arrow.
Whackl It rips into his shoulder, hurling him to the ground. Ape infantry -
foot soldiers - are coming into the gorge behind him.

In their midst are three huge steam-driven machines - like iron erector
sets. One is the Claw, one is the Balls and the other is the Flame.

THE CAVE ENTRANCE

Kip and his warriors have seen them too. They scramble into the cave. Men
and women are inside, swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from
tree trunks.

Other warriors, caught outside, run for the closing gap. On their heels is
Will - still clutching the crossbow, blood streaming from his wound. The
doors are closing... closing. Will dives through the gap, almost crushed -

INSIDE THE CAVE

Slam! The doors fly shut. Wham! A huge cross-beam drops into place. Will,
sprawled in the dust, looks up - chaos. By torchlight, the medicine man is
tending the wounded, children are screaming, women and old people are
clambering up a series of ledges. High above is a tiny slash of
daylightanother entrance.

From deep in the cave Will hears the roar of some animal but he doesn't
have time to think about it. Smash! The great wooden doors shudder from
some mighty blow.

OUTSIDE THE DOORS

The three machines are in place. The first of them has two huge stone balls
suspended by chains from an overhead jib. An ape sits right on top,
operating it. The balls dance and swing wildly - smash! They hit the door,
opening a hole.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Daylight streams in. Kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high
around the walls, ready to attack when the apes pour in. A pair of huge
iron jaws appear in the hole. This is the second of the apes' machines -
the Claw.

Another roar from the animal. Will watches the Claw reach in and grab the
massive crossbeam. It snaps it like a twig. Will gets to his feet and runs.
He sees Kip signal -

AN OLD WARRIOR

is perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the
cave, turning it into a cage. He opens it.

Crash! The stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open. The first of
the ape cavalry charges in. A roar from the unseen animal. The apes' horses
catch the scent of it. They whinny in terror.

Will stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage. The
tribe's totem is a living thing - the saber-toothed tiger ia three times
the size of its Bengal cousin, a head the size of an ox and two ten-inch
teeth curved down either side of its jaw.

The horses are bucking and rearing. The tiger leaps towards the door,
heading for freedom. A dismounted ape raises his weapon. The tiger doesn't
even break stride. One lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and
flesh of the ape's chest.

Will can smell the animal's breath as it flies past. An ape officer, still
on his horse, turns - another swipe from the.tiger's paw rips out his
throat.

Kip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry -
half of them dismounted, all of them in disarray. The tiger runs soars
through the doorway -

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Drak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into
the forest.

ON THE LEDGES

Kip's men are fighting as they retreat, heading towards the opening at the
roof of the cave. Will, clutching his wounded shoulder, makes his own way
up the wall.

Beneath him, Drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines - a long
iron tube in a rolling superstructure. Feeding it are a series of
oil-filled bladders. One of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole. A
tongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube. It's a flame thrower -The
fiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave. The flame engulfs two
warriors. Skin blazing, they plummet to the ground.

The flame thrower fires again - scorching the rock wall, filling the cave
wit a pall of smoke. It hits the tiny patch of daylight, cutting off
escape.

Will - trapped - runs along a ledge, over a pile of rocks and jumps. Into
mid-air! He lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels
into its flanks.

The apes and the surviving warriors turn. For a moment they just stare -
nobody's ever seen a human ride a horse before. Will flies towards the
entrance. He sees Kip on a ledge just above, battling three huge apes.

WILL

Jump!

Kip sees Will galloping towards him. One of the apes raises a double-bladed
sword. Kip jumps sprawling across the horse's neck, grabbing on to its
flowing mane.

Drak stares at Will - he's never seen anything like him. He wheels his
horse around and spurs it forward in pursuit.

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Will's horse bursts out of the cave - past the Claw and under the Balls.
The apes turn and look - astonished. They scramble for their horses. Drak
charges through.

Will hurtles towards the trees. Kip, hanging on for life, looks behind -
Drak raises his Gatling gun and aims. Kip wrenches Will's head down - zing!
The arrows skim past.

Drak can't outpace them - and he can't re-load at the gallop either. They
charge out of the camp, into -

THE DAPPLED LIGHT OF THE FOREST

Drak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge
ape stands on the back of the charging horse!

He jumps - his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough. He swings
himself up into the tree - he is an ape, after all. He throws himself from
branch to bough, traveling at incredible speed.

Will glances back - he sees Drak's riderless horse. His eyes dart in
confusion -where is he? We crane up - he's in the trees above! Drak jumps -

Wham! Hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into Will's shoulder, lifting him
out of the saddle and hurling him to the ground.

Kip hauls down on the horse's bridle - wheeling the stallion around.

Will looks up from the dust - Drak towers above him. Will sees Kip coming
back -

WILL (CONT'D)

Run!

A volley of arrows whiz past Kip - other apes are galloping through the
trees. Kip grabs the bridle and kicks - the horse spins and gallops away.

massive, armor-clad paw grabs Will's head. He looks straight into Drak's
face. The ape reaches out and rips a claw down Will's cheek. Will tries to
stifle the scream. Drak touches the wound and tastes the blood -

DRAK

So - it's human, after ell.

He spits the blood out in revulsion. Will stares into the piu-holes in his
face. Never has he seen eyes so cold.

Will tries to rise to hie feet. His wounded shoulder has weakened him - he
staggers. Drak's clenched fist, clad in chain mail, drives straight et
Will's jaw. Smashl Fade to black.

THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN

It's Will's point of view - he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart.
He's very weak, his shirt drenched in blood. He rolls over and the image
rights itself.

He drags himself on to all fours but he can't get any further - his legs
are chained.

WILL

(fevered, disoriented)

Where the fuck am I?

Will looks up - a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon.

GUARD

(smiling)

The end of the road.

Will - confused, panicky - grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to
his knees. He looks past an escort of ape cavalry - they are traveling down
an avenue of idols -towering statues of apes, sculpted out of stone, old as
ages past. Fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red,
flickering glow.

Will turns away. Behind him he sees humans, rows of them - dead - hanging
upsidl down from long poles like trophies.

Everything comes flooding back - he slumps against the side of the cart,
eyes barely focused. Blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool
between his legs. He doesn't even notice it.

MASSIVE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

spans a roaring river. Drak and his convoy clatter across it. We crane up -
laid out before is a city. Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged
ravine. Opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of
stone.

Apes are everywhere - hammering stones to enlarge a house, chattering in
the trees, swinging hand-over-hand along horizontal ladders - crossing from
one side of the ravine to the other.

Will has roused himself. He stares at the city through feverish eyes - to
him, it appears to float. Buildings swim in and out of focus. His shoulders
shake - he starts to laugh, an edge of hysteria to it.

WILL

A city... of course. Ape city! I've destroyed my mind. Or maybe I'm dead
and this is God's last joke - hell is ruled by apes.

Whhish - the end of a whip sails through the air. Crack! It hits Will's
back, doubling him over.

GUARD

Quiet, animal!

RIPPLES OF WATER

run across the surface of a beautiful pool. A black shape glides along
underwater. The head breaks the surface - it's an old gorilla, the fur on
his face gray and balding. This is NAZGUL. He is the Ghan - the President -
of the Council of Elders.

He walks out of the water. Other old apes - all male, their days of warring
and building over - lie around the pool. Several of them, draped only in
rough loin-cloths, groom each other, picking nits out of their fur.

The sound of a gong! Nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the
pool. He looks straight down the ravine - at the far end, Drak and his
troop come into view.

NAZGUL

The raiders are home.

OLD APE

(lazily)

Good hunting?

Nazgul squints against the sun. He sees the poles carrying the dead humans.

NAZGUL

By the look of it.

GRAY-BEARDED WARRIOR, HIS CHEST MARKED BY THE SCARS OF MANY BATTLES, GETS
UP -

GRAY BEARD

(proudly)

Not as good as when we rode the high ridges, I'll warrant.

NAZGUL

Times are different now. Back then, a could go out and come back with a
brace of animals. They're far scarcer now -

OLD APE

Not scarce enough, I say.

There's a murmur of agreement from the other apes.

A TINY BOAT

is wreathed in woven leaves. Lying in it is the dead body of a young ape.
The boat drifts down an underground stream. All around it rise the stone
walls of a huge cavern. Torches light up the gloom - this place is a
temple.

A group of apes - mourners - walk along a path, keeping pace with the
funeral boat.

They make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats - a dirge for
the dead.

At the head of the procession, swinging a smoking censer, is an ape wearing
a lion-skin cloak. His face is scarred and twisted - he has one cruel eye,
the other is just an empty socket. Beneath the cloak, one arm and a leg are
withered. The whole effect, rather than diminishing his power, enhances it.
His name is MA-GOG. He is high priest of the apes, defender of the faith,
keeper of the Book of the Lore.

The funeral boat gathers speed in the current. It thrusts towards sunlight
pouring through an arch.

A ROCK PLATFORM

The mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock. We pull back
to reveal where they stand - a huge crouching ape has been carved out of
the face of a cliff, Its bowed front legs form the archway, the entrance to
the temple of the ape.

CLOUDS OF MIST AND WIND-BLOWN SPRAY SWEEP OVER MA-GOG AND THE MOURNERS. ALL
AROUND THEM, THE SOUND OF ROARING WATER. THE FUNERAL BOAT FLOATS OUT OF THE
TEMPLE AND INTO A ROARING RIVER. MA-GOG SWINGS THE CENSER OVER THE WATER -

MA -GOG

(intoning)

In the beginning was the word, and the word was the Book of the Lore. It
says God created the ape in His own image. Alone among His creatures, the
ape has a soul. One crosses the river now but death is only a door. He will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen The mourners beat their chests
with their fists. They repeat the word "Amen".

For a moment the clouds of mist clear. Now we see where the boat is headed
- half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop. These are the Falls of No
Return. The boat races forward - over the waterfall it goes.

The sound of cheering voices, very faint, drifts towards them. Ma-Gog turns
and looks up the river towards the city -

APES HANG FROM THE 'LADDERS'

looking down on Drak and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut
into the side of the ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings
to greet them.

Will lies in the back of the cart, unconscious. Faces of apes stare in at
him - they've never seen anything like it. A young ape - a little boy -
stands with his grandfather.

KID

What is it?

GRANDFATHER

Some... sort of human.

KID

But look at the eyes, 'Pa - they're the color of the sea. Where's it from?

GRANDFATHER

I don't know - a traveler, maybe. Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower
of the Moon.

THE WORD "TRAVELER" IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES. IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE
CROWD. A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -

WOMAN

No it's not - it's a mutant.

LABORER

Put it in the zoo!

A female ape pushes them aside. She's heavy-set, bright eyes, an air of
authority about her. Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a
series of steel instruments dangling from it. Her name is ZORA - she is a
doctor.

She and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart.
Kneeling beside him, Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Will's
crotch.

ZORA

Whatever it is, it's male.

She rips open Will's shirt - his chest is covered in blood from the gaping
wound.

ZORA (CONT'D)

Probe.

The Assistant hands her a steel instrument. She slides it towards the
wound. We hold on Will's face - a strangled cry but he doesn't regain
consciousness. Zore returns the bloodied probe to her Assistant. She calls
out -

ZORA (CONT'D)

Drak!

The leader of the ape warriors, riding close by, turns -

ZORA (CONT'D)

The animal's bleeding to death, my Lord.

Drak rides up to the wagon.

DRAK

I didn't bring him all this way just to have him die.

ZORA

(to the assistant)

Ben-Guri - get a vet. Quicklyl

AN APE IN A LEATHER APRON

uses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife. This is the VET.
Will lies on a stone slab nearby - it's a sort of medical centersinks along
the walls, racks of equipment, hoses to wash down the blood.

The Vet cuts the clothing away from Will's wound. He turns to Doctor Zora -

VET

We're going to have to give him blood.

PRISONER IN A CELL

He's a tribesman - in his late 40s. Despite his tattered furs and hollow
cheeks, he carries himself with dignity - he's a proud man. His name is
ARAGORN. On a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament, like
crescent moon. Etched into it are strange markings and the totems of
various tribes.

The sound of a key in lock. Aragorn turns - the cell door is thrown back.
Three ape guards enter. Two of them, armed with spears, drive Aragorn into
a corner. The third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole. He drops
it over Aragorn's head.

Aragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight. They drag him from
the cell.

TEAM OF HORSES

- their flanks drenched in sweat - walk in a circle. They turn a huge wheel
that controls a series of pulleys and winches. Attached to the end of a
heavy cable is a wooden platform - a primitive elevator. It runs from a
series of impressive house, down the side of the ravine, to the center of
the city.

Standing on the platform are Nazgul and several other elders. They look
down on the central square. It's crowded with apes - soldiers are being
greeted by their kin.

ARAGORN LIES ON HIS BACK

He's strapped to a slab, half-naked, in the medical center. They've put a
gag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself, he can barely
move.

Will, still unconscious, lies on a table next to him. Nazgul peers down at
him.

NAZGUL

It's human, you say?

Doctor Zora nods - yes.

NAZGUL

It's even uglier than the others.

He pulls a covering aside and looks at Will's naked legs.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

How can he hunt with legs like those -they're like twigs. Maybe he's
diseased.

Everybody shrugs - who knows?

The Vet heats a steel needle over an open flame. The other end of the
needle is attached to a length of animal intestine. It acts as a tube. The
Vet grabs Will's forearm and slides the red-hot needle into the vein.
Will's body jerks with the pain. Nazgul and the others spring back.

For a moment Will's wrenched back to consciousness - he sees a light-filled
room, a bandage on his chest, a bladder full of blood hanging above him.
His puts it together the only way he knows - he thinks he's in hospital

WILL

(groggy)

Help me. I've got health insurance. Honest...

His eyes close as he slips back into darkness. Nazgul looks at Doctor Zora.

NAZGUL

What is health insurance?

DOCTOR ZORA

Some sort of religion...?

The Vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder. Another length of
tubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to Aragorn's arm. It's
his blood. Now we realize - this is the ape version of a blood transfusion.

NAZGUL

Do you think this'Il work?

VET

You can never tell with animals. Their bodies aren't as sophisticated as an
ape's. Sometimes their blood fights with each other. Either way, you know
really quick -they get up and walk around, or they're dead.

The Vet turns a little tap - Aragorn's blood flows down the tube. It hits
Will's vein.

WORDS CHISELED INTO STONE

"An Ape without knowledge is a fire without light."

Euripadape III

It stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge. This is the Hall
of Learning. Ma-Gog - his lion skin cloak billowing behind him - hurries up
the steps.

THE BLADDER OF BLOOD

is empty. Guards are collaring Aragorn, preparing to drag him out. The door
into the room is thrown open. Ma-Gog enters. Nazgul and the others greet
him but he barely acknowledges it *

MA-GOG

Show him to me.

The Vet grabs Will's hair. He lifts up his head so that Ma-Gog can see his
face.

The high priest takes a step back - there's something about Will that fills
him with loathing. Anger flashes in his one good eye. He stares at Will.
His voice is Iow, almost to himself -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

All my life I've dreaded this day.

(turns to the others)

Kill him.

DOCTOR ZORA

We've just spent an hour trying to save him -

MA-GOG

Kill him!

He grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground. Doctor
Zora takes his arm, stopping him -

DOCTOR ZORA

The animal's unique, my lord. At least we should look at his brain. Maybe
it's possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him. Imagine - a
tame human!

MA-GOG

Man can't be tamed. Alone among God's primates he kills for lust or greed.
He will murder his own brother to possess his brother's land.

NAZGUL

The doctor's only asking for a chance to experiment. The benefits would be
enormous. A tame species of human could double food production, at last we
could dam the rivers.

MA-GOG

You don't know what you're dealing with.

NAZGUL

It's just an animal, Ma-Gog.

MA-GOG

It's not. That's the trouble.

A movement on the stone slab. They turn and look - Will's eyelids are
fluttering. He's starting to come round. itl

He turns to Nazgul In the name of God - summon the Council of Elders.

Will's eyes are open now. Like through a glass - darkly - he sees the ape
guards coming for him. He tries to struggle but he's very weak. They haul
him off.

HEAVY IRON DOOR

set in a rock wall - on one side a key-hole. We tilt up the door to a
narrow set of bars high above it. A face, straining with effort, rises up
to peer through the bars. It is Will - looking like death but forcing
himself to do it, desperate to see where he is.

INSIDE THE CELL

The muscles across his shoulders ripple. His one good hand clutches the
bars. He hangs by it, supporting his weight, staring out at a vaulted
underground cavern. It looks like a cattle-yard, broken down and disused
nowa series of long pens, wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt.

Will can't support himself any longer - he tumbles to the ground. He crawls
across the floor and examines the door. It fits tight to the rock. There's
no hope of picking the lock - the key-hole doesn't even come all the way
through.

Suddenly he stops. Nothing for a moment, then he hears it again - a
scraping sound.

He peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall. One of
the blocks moves. Will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell. Aragorn
squeezes through from the adjoining cell. He looks at Will -

ARAGORN

So you lived, then?

WILL

What did they do?

ARAGORN

They gave you blood.

He holds up his bandaged forearm - Will realizes where it came from.

WILL

I hope you had a medical.

Aragorn looks at him - confused. From a distance, the sound of horses
whinnying.

WILL (CONT'D)

What is this place?

ARAGORN

It was a slaughterhouse.

WILL

For horses?

ARAGORN

They use it for stables now. No - s different kind of animal. For humans.

Will stares, taken aback. Aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners
of the cell.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

In my father's time, the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here.
Young apes killed some during their manhood rites, the others were made
sport of in the corrals. At the end, the bodies were thrown onto the belts
and fed to the fire.

Aragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves. From out of his cloak, he
takes two pieces of flint and strikes them. A spark starts the fire -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

(softly)

Death is stuck to these walls, stranger -sounds not even s thousand winters
can take away. Sometimes of s night they speak to me - I can hear the
screams of my people.

Will looks at him. Firelight plays across their faces.

WILL

Why haven't they killed you?

ARAGORN

They keep me ss bait. My name is Aragorn -

He lifts his hand to Will - palm outwards. It's some form of greeting. Will
returns it.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

I am the Ranger of the Easterlings, the Leader of the Seven Tribes. They
hope the warriors will come and try to free me.

WILL

And will they?

ARAGORN

Not if they fear my anger. I was taken in summer and now winter's almost
gone. Even the apes grow tired - soon they'll make me walk the Paths of the
Dead.

Will looks at Aragorn's eyes - they're fearless. The ornament glints on his
chest. Will points at it -

WILL

what is it?

ARAGORN

It's called the Crescent of Light - it's the talisman of my rank.

WILL

Silver.

ARAGORN

Mithral is how we name it..

Will reaches his hand towards it -

WILL

Can I borrow it?

Aragorn recoils - this is the most precious thing in the world to him. His
hand closes around the insignia -

ARAGORN

Who are you? What brings you to the valley of the tribes?

WILL

I meant you no harm. I'm looking for woman, one of my own kind. Do you know
of people like me?

ARAGORN

Never.

Will nods his head, accepting it. Slowly he reaches his hand out -

WILL

If you want to get out of hare. I need the talisman. Aragorn.

The two men look at each other. A beat - then Aragorn reaches up and
unfastens it.

THE TEMPLE OF THE APE

Torches burn on the walls. They cast a glow across the temple - the
underground stream, pools of water, shelves of rock hewn out of the walls.
Several apes crouch on them, praying to a golden idol of an ape.

Mist rises off of the pools. Moving through it, we see Nazgul, Drak and e
group of old apes. The Council of Elders is gathering. They pass through a
narrow door -

THE TEMPLE'S INNER CHAMBER

Oil lamps - hidden in alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog. He stands in front of an
ancient book - strange symbols, like Sanskrit, run across its pages. This
is the Book of the Lore.

Ma-Gog looks at the Council of Elders seated in front of himNazgul, Drak
and five other huge apes - all leaders in their time.

MA-GOG

How many scrolls are there in the Book of the Lore?

Nobody replies - the question is so obvious it needs no answer.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

One-hundred-and-seventy-six, you say -every child knows that.

(softly)

But every child is wrong. There is one more scroll - the last scroll,
sealed with seven seals, handed down from high priest to high priest...

He slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden
catch. The top - the Book still resting on it - tilts up, revealing a
secret compartment. It is lined with gold leaf. Lying in it is a slim folio
of pages -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

It is called the Scroll of Revelation.

The Council of Elders stare in awed silence. Ma-Gog takes the pages out and
unfastens the seals. He reads -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"And it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages. A silence fell and I
saw a new heaven and a new earth. Like through a glass, darkly, I saw the
future."

The Council of Elders stare at him. He limps forward and stops in front of
them. He recites from memory -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the
horse is Death. Those that ride on him are beasts, but like no beasts born
before. Their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea. They
are given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and
with fire. And let him that hath understanding know the number of these
beasts. It is the number of Man."

He raises his eyes and looks straight at the Councilors.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Today we saw that beast. Mark those words, my Lords - "their limbs are weak
but they are given power over the earth". Now will you listen? Kill him!
And if we don't? Then all hope will fail in this bitter winter.

He lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment. Nazgul
looks from one to the other of the elders. Nobody says a word but he can
read their grim expressions. He turns to Drek -

NAZGUL

Kill him. Kill him with the sword and with fire. Kill himl

THE KEYHOLE TO THE CELL

It's a shining bright image, slightly distorted. We pull back to reveal
it's a reflection. Aragorn's silver ornament has been polished to a
brilliant luster. It's fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking
through the bars high above the iron door.

INSIDE THE CELL

The wooden bed has been smashed to pieces.

Both Aragorn and Will have used parts of their clothing to harness
themselves so they can see through the bars. Aragorn controls the pole with
the "mirror" on the end of it.

By looking into it, Will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door.
He has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it. He turns the pole,
guiding the nail towards the keyhole. He's trying to pick the lock.

WILL

Do you understand time.., what time is it?

Aragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse -

ARAGORN

Seven hours since the rising of the sun.

WILL

Just after noon...

ARAGORN

Shouldn't we wait until night?

WILL

(concentrating)

If I'm right, it's gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think.

The nail is almost in the key-hole. Half an inch to go... a quarter. It
slides off. Will curses and starts again -

THE SUN

beats down from a cloudleu sky. Drak and two huge Praetorian Guards - Max
and Hannibal - come through a huge stone portico. It's another entrance to
the Temple -one that opertl onto a central square. Orak and the two guards
hurry across it. towards the slaughterhouu.

THE NAIL

at the end of the pole slides into the keyhole. Will - barely breathing in
case it breaks his concentration - listens carefully. He moves the end of
the pole. The nail turns.

HUGE SET OF DOORS

are thrown open. Daylight spills into the slaughterhouse. Drak, Max and
Hannibal enter. Drak stops - he listens to the horses whinnying and
stomping their hooves -

DRAK

Something's wrong!

(turns to Max)

Get the dogs.

HANNIBAL

moves cautiously along the side one of the corrals, trying to see what's
wrong with the horses. Behind him - a movement in the shadows.

Sswhish. The sound of something slicing through the air. He turns -

It's the side of Aragorn's hand. It chops hard into the ape's throat,
shattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness. He crumples to
the ground.

Aragorn and Will strip him of his weapons. Will starts to go but Aragorn
tears a strip off both their shirts. He ties the fabric around the ape's
ankles.

WILL

What are you doing?

ARAGORN

Watch - they're going to bring in the dogs.

THE DOGS

aren't really dogs at all - they're a much earlier ancestor. We call them
wolves. There are two of them, on the end of heavy leather leashes. Their
handlers have them in Will's cell, rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses
in front of their noses. The wolves take the scent.

Drak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes. The wolves leap out of
the cell.

HANNIBAL

rises groggily to his feet, clutching his injured throat. He takes a few
steps forward -Grrrr! He turns - the two wolves fly towards him. He tries
to yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak.

He runs - the fabric, unseen by him, trails from his ankles. The wolves
pound after him. He glances over his shoulder. First one wolf - then the
other - leaps.

Fangs and claws glistening, they hit him in the back, hurling him to the
ground. He writhes on to his back. One wolf tears at his ankles, the other
goes for his throat. Rip! Blood sprays as the artery breaks.

A STONE PASSAGE-WAY

Will and Aragorn are running, plunging down in to darkness. Arches and
corridors open off of it. It's like a labyrinth -

WILL

This doesn't seem like the way out.

ARAGORN

We're not going out - not yet.

WILL STOPS, GRABBING HOLD OF HIM, TURNING HIM ROUND -

WILL

So what are we doing?

ARAGORN

(softly)

We're going killing.

WILL

Killing?! Don't be stupid -

Will jerks on Aragorn's arm, starting to haul him back. Aragorn throws off
his hand -

ARAGORN

You do what you like! But I'm the Ranger of the Easterlings -I won't leave
here until it's done.

From behind them - the sounds of pursuit.

WILL

Shit!

He starts to run. Together they disappear into the gloom ahead.

ROW OF CAGE-LIKE CELLS

Will and Aragorn glide past them. They're taking it slowly, very carefully.

Now we see why - ahead of them is a set of steel doors. Torches on either
side illuminate a guard post but there's no sign of the sentry.

Will and Aragorn move closer. They pass -

CREVICE IN THE ROCK

We hold on the narrow opening, looking deep into the shadows. A big ape,
heavily armed, stands there. He has his back to us, his legs spread. A
trickle of water runs down the rock and drains away - he's taking a piss. A
shadow flickers on the wall above him. He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore
shadows -Will and Aragorn are move through the torchlight. The steel doors
are straight ahead.

The sentry slides out of the crevice - he's behind Will. Silently, back
pressed again6t the bars of a cell, he creeps closer to Will. He has a
curved knife in one hand and a short-handled spear in the other. Closer...
closer.

He raises the spear - a rustle of movement. Will spins - he sees the spear
about to thrust. He's a dead man.

An arm? It shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the
sentry's throat, half choking him.

Will leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentry's jaw.
The sentry crumples to the ground, revealing the face of the prisoner. It's
not a man, though -it's an ape. He's in his prime - barrel chested and a
fine head. His name is STRIDER.

He and Will look at each other through the bars.

STRIDER

Two rules in life - never play cards with anyone called Doc and never,
whatever else you do, turn your back on an ape.

Will stares at him. Strider grins. Will smiles back -

WILL

Thanks. I'll remember that.

He starts to search the sentry.

ARAGORN

What are you doing?

WILL

Looking for the keys.

ARAGORN

No!

WILL

He saved our lives.

ARAGORN

He's an ape!

Will shrugs himself free of Aragorn's hand -

WILL

You go and kill as many apes as you like - I'm setting this one free.

Aragorn looks at him. A beat.

ARAGORN

(softly)

It's not apes I'm going to kill.

A PRISON LABORATORY

The heavy steel doors stand open. Inside is a clean and gruesome room -
sinks and instruments along a wall, a series of operating tables and a row
of cages.

Behind the bars are six tribes-people - men, women and a little boy. All of
them carry surgical scars on their heads. It's made two of them blind; the
others stare blankly into space.

Aragorn moves down the cages. Several of them shuffle towards him but
there's no recognition - they're like the walking dead. Aragorn doesn't say
a word. Grim-faced, he loads the crossbow and starts to fire, killing them.

Will and Strider come through the doorway - they see Aragorn going from
cage to cage. Will steps forward, going to stop him. Strider's hand grabs
his shoulder, restraining him.

STRIDER

Leave it. He knows what he's doing.

Will turns and looks at him, questioning.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

The doctors operate on them - up here.

(taps his head)

The tribes think that we steal their souls...

(he pauses - softly)

Maybe they're right.

Aragorn reaches the last cage. A woman - in her 20s - stands in the middle
of the cell, looking at him. Aragorn stares at her face. His lip trembles
with emotion. She tilts her head on one side, as if trying to work
something out. Tears fill Aragorn's eyes. She stumbles a step forward. The
Ranger closes his eyes. He pulls the trigger. A crossbow bolt slams into
her chest and she falls.

Will leans against the doorway, unwilling to watch, staring down the
passageway. He turns at a footfall - Aragorn rejoins them. His voice is
hollow, as if something has died within him -

ARAGORN

It's done. We can go now.

He turns and leads them back down the passageway.

THE WOLVES

There's five of them now, hunting through the slaughter-house in a pack.
All around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and
crannies. The horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves.

Will, Aragorn and Strider are crouched in a corner of the corral, smearing
their bodies with horse manure.

STRIDER

The fresher the better. Cover everything -that's the only way you'll hide
your scent.

The wolves sniff the air, coming closer. Will, staring through the rungs of
the coral, sees their gleaming eyes coming closer. He raises his crossbow,
getting ready.

The wolves stop. They raise their heads and look - the whole cavern is
growing dark. A giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside
world.

The horses rear and buck. The apes are staring - darkness is falling in the
middle of the day. The wolves hackles rise in fear. They howl.

Aragorn and Strider are cowering back

ARAGORN

What is it?

WILL

Come on! Now!

He drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses.

AN UNEARTHLY LIGHT

has fallen on the city. The apes are in confusion - soldiers and workers
are running, children are screaming. A horse has thrown its rider and is
bolting down the terraces.

The darkness grows ever deeper. In the sky, the face of the moon
obliterates the sun - it's a full solar eclipse.

Two horses, flying at a gallop, charge through the doors of the
slaughterhouse. Will is on one, Aragorn clinging to his back. Strider is on
the other. They wheel across an open space, through running apes, and speed
down a terrace.

MA-GOG

steps out on to a rock ledge. He holds a staff in one hand, his cloak
thrown back over his shoulder, magnificent in the eerie light. He stares
down at the chaos. Drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side -

DRAK

What is it?

MA-GOG

(wild)

A sign - the hand of Man passes across the face of God! Lookl He points to
a terrace below - Will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to
the iron bridge. Drak and Ma-Gog stare at them. Darkness engulfs them.

Out of the blackness, an image -

CHRIST ON THE CROSS

It's a stained-glass window in a huge cathedral. A priest is at the altar
conducting Mass for the repose of the dead. We pull back to reveal a tiny
white coffin - just big enough for a baby. Next to it is another coffin.
And another - a row of them.

PRIEST

And even now as sorrow has no end, we find comfort in the words of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Did he not say unto Mark -"suffer the little children to come
unto me, for they are the Kingdom of Heaven. Now and forever." Amen.

The congregation - sad-eyed relatives and weeping parents - fill the pews.

CONGREGATION

Amen.

Pall-bearers lift up the tiny coffins. The organ starts to play. A soloist
- a tenor -steps to the side of the altar. He starts to sing the Latin hymn
"Penis Angelicas". The haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral. They
carry over to -

THE SPACE DOME

is lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day. The clock tower
above the biology building shows the time2.00am. Even so, the area bustles
with activity.

INSIDE THE DOME

An illuminated chart dominates one wall - just like the strategy map in the
Pentagon's war room. Every research center is identified - next to it is
its function and a list of personnel. We see Princeton, Stanford, Texas
A&M, Los Alamos. Tentacles reach out to Oxford, the Pasteur Institute, the
University of Beijing...

Below the chart are nitrogen-cooled Cray super-computers. We track through
teams of men and women processing data, satellite dishes feeding a
communications network, a video conference taking place in a corner,
technicians routing and re-routing phone calls and faxes.

We come to a glass wall. On the other side is Diamond -

A SMALL OFFICE

Glass doors seal out the electronic hum. Diamond, staring through the
glass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent sits on a couch. He's in his
shirt-sleeves, dark rings under his eyes. Next to him is Bob, the young
neurologist. He wears jeans and a t-shirt. On the front it says

"I'll sleep when I'm dead."

The coffee table is piled with files, journal extracts and computer
print-outs. A video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a
screen.

Diamond rubs her eyes, trying to wipe away the fatigue.

DIAMOND

I'm sorry Luc - say that again.

DEMAUPASSANT

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

(kindly)

My fault, Billie - I rattle on too much. The result is - we've fixed the
time frame.

He hits the projector - the image of a fetus developing normally in the
womb appears on the screen... deMAUPASSANT

The fetus develops normally through the first trimester. Then it happens -
about sixteen weeks and two days, everything falls apart. The whole
chemical structure goes out of control -

He flashes up another image - a fetus that is already aging remarkably.
deMAUPASSANT

Once it starts, it's irreversible. If we're going to stop it, we've got to
intercede here -

He points at the slide of the normally developing fetus.

BOB

(taking over)

There's a trigger - some major fucking switch gets turned. That's what I've
been working on. It's definitely in the mDNA. There's a fragment of one
chromosome I'm looking at -

He flicks a switch on the video projector. A slide of a human gene,
massively magnified, popl on to the screen.

BOB (CONT'D)

It's so different, I call it the alien. How it got there, exactly what it
does - I haven't got the first idea.., no fucking idea at all.

Diamond looks at his grim face. He seems totally defeated.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

Is it that bad?

He stares at the floor. There's not even a hint of the former arrogance.

BOB

Someone's dropped us in the middle of the Louvre. We're blind men and
they've told us to find the Mona Lisa. There's four miles of galleries end
we've got five minutes to do it. That's how I feel -and that's when rm
optimistic.

Diamond turns to deMaupassant.

DIAMOND

Luc?

DEMAUPASSANT

I'm sixty-two years old. I've seen us go from DC3s to landing on the moon.
In my life I've won all the glittering prizes. I've always believed nothing
was beyond the reach of Man, but I'll tell you honestly - this may never be
unraveled. If it is, it won't be in my lifetime.

He looks at them. Silence. There's nothing anyone can say. He starts to
gather up his papers-

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

So what do we do? I think it's like Gatsby -"so we beat on, boats against
the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." There's no other way,
ia there?

They nod their hoods - you have to try. DeMaupaasant and Bob start to
leave.

DIAMOND

Luc?

(he turns))

You're certain - about the time, I mean?

DEMAUPASSANT

(Nodding)

Sixteen weeks. How far along are you?

DIAMOND

Twelve weeks.

They look at one another. The old man speaks gently -

DEMAUPASSANT

Good night, Billie.

A TINY FETUS

perfectly formed - floats in the amniotic fluid. It's alive - the large
head sways, the heart beats through the translucent ribs.

Diamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs. She
lies on a stainless steel table in a hi-tach examination room. A complex
array of equipment -ultra-sounds and scanners - beams down on her exposed
stomach. It projects a , video image onto a screen.

She is alone in the room, manipulating the equipment herself. She stares up
at the child growing in her womb. We see the genitalia.

DIAMOND

So - you're a little boy. It's funny - I think I knew.

She reaches up and gently touches the image of his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

We've got four weeks. The way I see it -there's nothing to lose. I can't
tell you whet'Il happen to us. It's on the edge, mister. The air's so thin
out there, we may not even be able to breathe. But what the hell - it's a
chance.

She takes her hand away and looks at his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You want to try it? Sure you do. You're my son. We've waited all our lives
for each other.

A STACK OF HAND-WRITTEN NOTEPADS

lie on a table in the basement. We track through them - past computer
print-outs and dog-eared journals. We recognize them - these are Will's
detailed notes.

To the table is the makeshift lab - racks of bottles and syringes. In the
dim light we see Diamond. She removes the catheter from her vein, turns and
climbs up the flotation tank.

INSIDE THE TANK

Water sloshes back and forth. Diamond lowers herself in and floats there.
For a moment, she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the
hatch. We hold on her face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

So we beat on, boats against the current.

She reaches up and pulls the hatch shut. Clang! Darkness.

THE SUN AND THE MOON

It's one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the
sky together. Smoke drifts across them. We tilt down to ape city -

A column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the
slaughterhouse.

RED HOT FIRE

burns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse. The rickety
conveyor belt is working, clattering away. Several ape workers throw the
bodies of the lab animals - the dead tribes-people - on to the belt.

The body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt. It dumps him into
the furnace. The flames engulf him.

WILL'S EMPTY CELL

The door hangs open. The space is lit by a dozen torches. Drak is alone,
moving around the cell, trying to work out how Will escaped. He looks at
the smashed bed, the hole in the wall, the torn clothing that made the
harness.

He swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock. No answers
there. Lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end.
Drak picks it up. He turns it over in his hand, th!nking about it.

He jumps! One handed he catches hold of the bars above the door.
Effortlessly, he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars. The
nail touches the lock.

DRAK

(to himself)

Clever... you clever fucking animal.

DOCTOR ZORA (O.S.)

My lord...

He turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him.

DOCTOR ZORA (CONT'D)

(urgent)

Could I see you please?

THE HALL OF POWER

is a magnificent room - stone columns and towering trees growing in huge
pots. At one end is a rock shelf - open to the gathering twilight.
Silhouetted against it, commanding a view of the entire city, is the
Council of Elders. They sit around a table made from bone and tusks, deep
in discussion.

Nazgul looks up - he sees Drak approaching through the shadows.

NAZGUL

Drak. I was just saying - maybe it's a blessing.

DRAK

A blessing?

NAZGUL

Where there's one, there must be others. If we'd killed him, we might never
find them.

MA-GOG

But the animal's not stupid - he knows come day-break we'll be tracking
him. Who's to say he'll run for home?

Drak stops in front of them.

DRAK

No - he's not stupid. But even dogs hunt in packs of seven. Every animal
needs its kind. And when we find them - what then?

MA-GOG

What do you think?!

DRAK

Just like the tribes - burn them out of their holes, put them to the sword?
I don't mind doing that - I like it - but it's never enough, is it? No
matter how many we kill, every year they're still here. Why will it be any
different with the Blue Eyes? What we need is a final solution.

NAZGUL And where do we find that?

DRAK (CONT'D)

Doctor Zora's brought back patients from a place called Kismatu. I've been
talking to her about it -

Several of the Council are looking at each other - perplexed.

MA-GOG

What is Kismatu?

NAZGUL

It's a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier. Females and
babies have been dying there.

He turns to Drak - his eyes intense, very interested.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Go on.

COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

There are iron barn on I series of high windows but in the middle of the
room is a jungle-gym. Underneath it are ape toys. Five baby apes sit on
cots. They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end
bodies are those of old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.

A double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock. Hanging on them is a sign

"Quarantine. No Entry".

Drak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children. Doctor Zora is
with them - she's nervous, twisting her fingers.

DOCTOR ZORA

We don't know what causes it- a virus probably. I'd hoped to complete our
research before I came to you with my proposal. But, given the
circumstances -

NAZGUL I

It's a brilliant idea.

(turns and smiles at her)

Brilliant.

HORSES' HOOVES

paw the ground. They're bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail. It's
night -the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock.

Will and Strider have made camp - a hare roasts over the fire. Aragorn sits
well apart - a silhouette in the moonlight - staring out into the forest,
lost in his thoughts. Will and Strider look at him.

STRIDER

He's their leader - he can never take his eye from the mountain. He has to
do what he thinks is right.

WILL

(hard)

By killing them?

STRIDER

Don't judge him, Will. I couldn't have done it. I wonder if you could? One
of those women he just killed wes his daughter.

Will reacts. He turns and stares at the silhouette. A long beat.

WILL

(quietly)

We call it a Iobotomy. What other things have you people tried?

He turns to face him. Strider shrugs. There's something about it -
something almost evasive.

WILL (CONT'D)

Fuck you, Strider! Tell me!

He stares at Will - he's never seen him angry.

STRIDER

don't know if it's true.., my sister's mate works in the lab. He says
Doctor Zora's working on some disease -

Will comes towards him -

WILL

What sort of disease?

STRIDER

Of the children, I think - ape children.

WILL

How did they die, Strider? Old in the belly -is that how?!

STRIDER

Some of them. You know this disease?

Will stares at him, taking it in.

WILL

(softly)

So that's how it happened. Fuck you people.

STRIDER

They haven't done it yet. It may not work.

WILL

They will and it does.

He turns end takes step towards the forest. He runs his fingers through his
hair -WILL God help us.

STRIDER

That's funny - that's exactly what an ape would say.

Will turns. He and Strider stare at one another - the ape and the man, both
struck by the sudden commonality.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry...

Will walks slowly back to the fire. Strider starts to strip the meat off a
hare he's roasting over the flames. He offers it to Will. He shakes his
head - he's not hungry anymore. He stares into the flames -

WILL

What about you, Strider - why were you in the cell?

STRIDER

I fought another ape. Nothing very heroic, I'm afraid - I was drunk. He
fell badly, his head hit the branch of a tree going down. It broke his
neck.

He pauses We're not like humans. An ape never kills one of his own. Never.

WILL

What's the punishment?

STRIDER

At the ceremony of summer rites, the high priest would curse me with death.

I would have been left to die in the forest -no journey over the waterfall,
no-one to say the sacred words. Without that, no ape can walk in the next
world. You saved my life, Will and I'm grateful. But there's nothing I can
do about my soul. I'm a dead ape walking.

Strider stripe more meet off the hare. Will picks up a saddle and blanket
and starts to make himself bed.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

You knew, didn't you? You knew the sun was going to swallow the moon.
That's why you weren't afraid.

Will pauses - then he turns to him.

WILL

Yes - I knew.

STRIDER

WHO ARE YOU, WILL?

WILL

I've come a long way, Strider - it's farther then I can explain.

STRIDER

I've heard stories - old apes tell them 'round the fire late at night - of
strange lands where the creatures can tell the future. Is that where you're
from?

WILL

In a way.. yeah, it's something like that.

STRIDER

So what happens to it afl, to the world we've built? Tell me that.

WILL

It passes away.

Strider stares at him through the firelight.

STRIDER

History remembers, though - it's passed on, what we did, I mean?

WILL

No, Strider - there's nothing, not a trace left behind.

Strider thinks for a moment, then he smiles gently.

STRIDER

So it's just vanity then - what we believe, that the works of the ape will
last forever?

WILL

Yes, it's vanity. But not just of apes, Strider -maybe of men, too.

He turns and settles down on his makeshift bed. Strider - the food
forgotten - stares out into the night. A million stars hang on a velvet
sky.

Look down from them - in the vast blackness of the forest, one tiny
lightthe flickering fire.

DUST SWIRLING, HOOVES POUNDING

battalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables. Dawn is breaking across
the city. Ma-Gog stands on a ridge, his staff raised, blessing the army as
it rides out.

At its head is Drak. He clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down
the avenue of idols. Votive fires burn in front of every statue.

A RAINBOW

arches across the end of a tiny gorge. Dozens of streams cascade into
pools, spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds. Aragorn leads Will and
Strider along a hidden, path - a rock ledge that runs behind the
waterfalls.

The ledge widens into a large cave. Sunlight streams through a veil of
cascading water. Aragorn looks around - something's worrying him.

ARAGORN

This is the Rainbow Tribe's cave. They should be here.

A STONE FIREPLACE

Aragorn places his hand on the circle of stones, feeling its warmth.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

They left at the rising of the sun.

He moves deeper into the cave - a maze of limestone caverns and
passage-ways. He stops at sleeping area - weapons lie there, food in
baskets.

ARAGORN

(softly)

Why such hurry?

Suddenly he stops, listening. He looks at Strider -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

You heard it?

Strider nods his head - yes. Will hasn't heard a thing. He listens hard -
nothing.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Animal?

STRIDER

I don't think so.

Strider moves silently to the side of the cave. He picks up a crossbow.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Is there another entrance?

ARAGORN

From the ridge above. Apes?

STRIDER

Scouts probably.

He cocks the crossbow. Aragorn has picks up a bow and spear. He moves
towards a cavern, signaling Strider to take a passageway.

Will grabs a crossbow. Strider tosses him a chain mail vest - armor. They
move off.

HONEYCOMB OF PASSAGES

eep in the cave. A sound - pebbles falling off a ledge. Then we see a
flicker of light - a torch is moving through a cavern. Whoever holds it,
turns a corner and is lost in darkness.

A CROSSROADS

of arches and stalactites. Will and Strider split apart. Will moves
silently through the darkness, into a cavern. Through an archway he sees a
shadow on the wall! He goes fast towards it -

A HUGE BOULDER

The shadow comes round the boulder. We tilt down and now we see who's
holding the torchDiamondl She's armed with a crossbow - cocked end loaded.
She turns a corner -

Ten feet in front of her is Strider. She stares at the massive ape's back -
a bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder. Her eyes widen with fear.
She raises the crossbow -

Strider hears it. He spins, weapon rising -

turns into a passage midway between them. He sees Diamond about to fire. He
screams -

Too late - she pulls the trigger! Will hurls himself forward - in front of
Strider. Whack! The arrow blasts into his chest. He crashes to the ground.

Diamond stares down at him.

DIAMOND

Will!

His eyes open - he's gasping for breath from the impact. He and Diamond
look at one another. Strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of Will's
chain mail armor. Diamond's shoulders sag with relief.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(indicates Strider Who's he?

WILL

I'll explain later.

He struggles to his feet and looks at Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

What made you come? I thought the mDNA was just a theory. One of dozens of
theories - isn't that what you said?

DIAMOND

We did a lot of work. I guess I was wrong.

WILL

People have been wrong about a lot of things.

THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.

WILL (CONT'D)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering, snow-capped peak.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -
we've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be
done, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time. How long has science dreamed of that?

DIAMOND

How long have you?

WILL

All my life.

DIAMOND

Dream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

WILL

(softly)

Yeah - I really have, haven't I?

Diamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -

STRIDER (O.S.)

Aragorn - I've found it!

A CAVE PAINTING

Newly-drawn, is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave. Strider, Will
and Diamond watch aa Aregorn looks at it by torchlight.

ARAGORN

I thought they would leave word for their hunters. Kip-Kena has called a
gathering of the Seven Tribes.

WILL

Where?

ARAGORN

Two days' travel - at the Eagle's Nest.

He looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

We'll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave at first light.

THE EMBERS OF A FIRE

burn in the circle of stones. Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it.
Will and Diamond have been awake all night. They sit in the shadows near
the entrance to the cave, speaking quietly.

DIAMOND

An ape civilization? You said there was a city.., what happened to it all?

WILL

You know what we've found of Aragorn's whole race? Seventeen bones, that's
all. Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them
skulls. Bones last a lot longer than civilizations.

DIAMOND

I guess there's a lesson in that.

WILL

Listen, Billie - the apes have discovered a disease.

Diamond reacts. Will crouches down - in the dirt he scratches out a small
chain of circles. It's a molecule.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's really rare and, lucky for them, it's in an isolated area. They're not
stupid - they understand it's potential. They plan to give it to the tribes
-

He draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow-legged stick figure of a man.

WILL (CONT'D)

And maybe they do, but it doesn't matter -Aragorn's people aren't us.
Already evolution's taken another track -

scratches a cross through the bow-legged man. He draws the figure of an
upright human.

WILL (CONT'D)

Somewhere in the rift valley is someone like us - the first man.

DIAMOND

Woman. You said it was in the mitochondrial DNA - it has to be a woman.

She reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figure's head.

WILL

You're right. Sooner or later the apes find her. She doesn't look like the
tribes but the apes don't care - she's human.

So they give her the disease. She's different though - it doesn't work, or
at least it doesn't seem to. It gets integrated into her. It's passed on,
it mutates, it weaves its way into the mDNA. It lies there - a bomb waiting
to go off. And then one day -

DIAMOND

After a hundred thousand years?

WILL

The planet's five billion years old. What's that to Nature? A blink of the
eye.

Will throws the stick down on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's the theory, anyway.

DIAMOND

(impressed)

A helluva theory, Doctor Plant.

HE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

There's not much time, Will. We have to find her before the apes and we
have to do it within four weeks.

WILL

Jesus, Billie! Four weeks? We've got a theory - that's all. We don't even
know half the problems we're dealing with. You can't put a deadline on
science.

DIAMOND

Science, Will? What about people? Isn't that what this is all about. I'm
sorry - I thought there were children dying.

WILL

Sure. Of course it's about that too.

DIAMOND

But then, you don't care muchabout people do you?

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -

WILL

No - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what
matter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.

DIAMOND

Progress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up
to believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that
mean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I
came? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a
child -that's why I'm here.

They look at one another.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Uke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with
them?

(indicates Aragore and Strider)

We should cut ourselves loose.

WILL

We wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like
storm-troopers.

DIAMOND

Where are they now?

WILL

Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head.

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.

ARAGORN

Ready?

A SPARKLING RIVER

winds through a beautiful valley. The two horses splash along the water's
edge. Strider and Aragorn are mounted on one, Will and Diamond on the
other. They turn a curve - Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into
the forest.

THE CAVE OF THE RAINBOW

Ape soldiers are swarming over the cave. A TRACKER uses torchlight to study
footprints. He looks up at Orak -

TRACKER

There's four of them, my Lord.

DRAK

Four? The Tracker points It a at of prints -

TRACKER

It's woman. Blue Eyes has a mate.

DRAK

Excellent. I look forward to meeting her.

SOLDIER (O.S.)

My Lord - hoof prints.

Drak turns - the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of
the cave. Drak looks up - high above he sees a slash of daylight. It's
another entrance.

DRAK

Malakai! Bolag!

Two heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers. With Drak they
run for the wall. They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing
tiny ledges.

Other apes follow them. They scramble up the wall with amazing speed.

AN EAGLE CIRCLES

Soaring and hovering in the sky. We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in
skins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak. He's a
LOOKOUT. He tenses -

Four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff. The
Lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle. It carries down to -

SERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS

are built into the rocky crags, opening into caves. They are connected by
ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live
with their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.

The platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes. People turn
at the Lookout's cry. A man pushes through, listening - it's Kip-Kena.

THE LOOKOUT POST

Kip follows the direction of the Lookout's pointing finger. Will and
Diamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path.

KIP

It's the traveler! With a woman...

The Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming
closer.

LOOKOUT

The fool - he's brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kip's
hand falls on his arm, stopping him.

KIP

Who's the other one, though?

(realizing)

Aragorn!

He turns, yelling down to the platforms -

KIP (CONT'D)

It's the Ranger! The Ranger is free!

ON THE PLATFORMS

The tribes-people burst into action - running for the bridges, scaling the
ladders.

A WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR

Whack! It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It's a
primitive drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.

The tribes-people are gathering, eager to greet him. Then they see Strider.
A ripple of fear and anger runs through them.

ARAGORN

The ape travels with me - treat him as a friend.

Nobody argues with the Ranger. He stops in front of Kip. The young warrior
starts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him. He puts out his arms - they
embrace.

Will crosses the bridge. Kip sees him. He grasps Will's arm in greeting -

KIP

You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life. Welcome, Traveler.

INSIDE THE EAGLE'S NEST

A series of caves, connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain.
They're crowded with members of various tribes - children are playing,
flint-knappers are fashioning tools, women ara cooking.

A shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall. Kip and Will have
found a quiet place amid the bustle.

WILL

Are the seven tribes here?

KIP

All except the Antelope. They hunt the plains far to the west - they have
the longest journey.

WILL

Will they come?

KIP

Who knows - maybe the apes have found them. Nobody has seen them for many
summers gone. Why?

WILL

I'm searching for someone - a young woman. She looks like us ...

(he indicates Diamond))

I thought she might live with the tribes.

KIP

Is she a relative - was she born to your hearth?

WILL

To all of our hearths. My race reveres her. We think of her as the first
woman. Without her. our lives are nothing.

KIP

(nodding his head)

Women are of the spirit - we believe that. too. Mother Earth mates with the
totems. Only through woman can their children walk the world.

WILL

Have you seen her?

KIP

NO.

WILL

You're sure? Perhaps some of the women have seen something?

KIP

She looks like you, you say? No offense, Traveler, but the women say you're
the ugliest man they've ever seen. A woman that looks like you - I'm sure
they would have talked about it.

WILL

Ugly?

They smile at one another.

KIP

I'm sorry I can't help.

A torch flares below. Kip looks down into an adjoining cave. It's empty
except for a group of men - all warriors - filing in. These are the leaders
of each of the tribes.

ANOTHER TORCH IS LIT

They ring the walls of the small cave. By their light we see the skins, the
feathers and the symbols of each tribe's totem - the eagle, the tiger, the
rainbow...

Beneath each one squats its leader. One place is empty - the Tribe of the
Antelope. Will sits near the entrance. He watches Aragorn - dressed in
ceremonial robes, the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to
his feet.

ARAGORN

We've traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind. The ape says
it's an army.

KIP

And there are more coming from the north. Five squadrons et least, the
runners say. It's led by the old warrior Nazgul.

ARAGORN

Is that why you called the gathering?

KIP

Great things are moving, Ranger -

An old man, battle-scarred and gray, leans forward. He is the leader of the
Rainbow.

A RAINBOW

A stranger walks out of the west, the moon hides the sun, armies are on the
march - come the new moon, nothing in Middle Earth will be the same.

Others nod their heads in agreement.

KIP (CONT'D)

We either fight or flee - the Tribes must decide.

ARAGORN

I know you, Kip - you always were a fighter. What do the others say?

warrior in a feathered cloak speaks -

EAGLE

It doesn't matter what we say - the Ranger has returned. We'll follow
wherever he leads.

Aragorn looks at their faces. Slowly he shakes his head -

ARAGORN

I'll walk the path Mother Earth has laid for me, but I'll walk it no more
as Ranger.

The leaders stare at him. Several start to object but he silences them with
his hand -

ARAGORN

A man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine.

(softly)

I took the life of my daughter - and some of your kinfolk with it. I did my
duty -nothing more can be asked of I men. But now others must walk in my
place.

He walks forward, unfastening the Crescent of Light. He stops in front of
Kip -

ARAGORN

If I should have had a son, I would have hoped for a man as fine as you.
This is my last act as Ranger of the Easterlings-

He reaches out and slips the Crescent of Light around Kip's neck.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Take care of my father's people. Guide them well.

(he looks at the leaders)

You must decide what is best for the Tribes. For me... I was the one that
had to strike the blow, but it was the apes who killed my child. Tomorrow I
will go to fight them. What father could do any less?

He turns away and walks towards the entrance. Only Will sees the tears in
his eyes.

KIDS' FACES, WIDE-EYED

They huddle together - staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape.
Strider is building a small fire at the side of the cave, Diamond lays down
furs for sleeping. , She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the
meeting. Will approaches.

WILL

They're going to war. They leave at dawn.

STRIDER

They'll be slaughtered.

WILL

They think if they leave the valley, their totems won't follow. Without
them, they say they're dead anyway.

DIAMOND

We should go now.

Will looks at her. She meets his gaze. Suddenly she realizes -

DIAMOND

Oh, nol We're not fighting someone else's war -

WILL

Listen to me -

DIAMOND

We've got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to find her. She's not here, so whet
are we waiting for? Let's go!

The tribes-people turn at the raised voices. Will takes Diamond's arm and
guides her to a private corner -

WILL

Listen, Billie! We know the future - but if we beat the apes, they can't
harm the woman.

DIAMOND

Beat the apes?! And say we don't - or say one of us gets captured. What
then? Don't you understand? Four weeksi

WILL

Yeah, I understand - but those things aren't going to happen. We know
things the apes can't even dream of. This is our world, Billie - men won it
with their minds. All we need is knowledge and science. We've got them
both. We can win!

DIAMOND

What are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus? This is an army, Will
- you said it yourself. Storm-trooperst

WILL

Look -

He bends and picks up s rock from the ground. He hands it to Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

Taste it. That's saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate. The
caves are littered with the stuff. You've smelt the air - there's sulfur
all around. If we burn timber, that'Il give us charcoal. You're s scientist
- you know what it means.

Sure - she knows what it means. She stares at him.

DIAMOND

It's strange, isn't it? Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks
about is weapons.

WILL

We're a frail species, Billea. It's only weapons that have made us bigger
than we are.

DIAMOND

Or smaller.

WILL

It's the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this. We can
beat themi No more experiments - no more problem.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

I hope your right, Will.

FIRES BURN

all over the eagle's nest, turning piles of timber into charcoal. The camp
is a hive of activitycolumns of tribes-people make their way up from the
valley carrying piles of sulfur rock; women and children sit in circles,
pounding the saltpeter into dust. Will moves among the tribal leaders,
watching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls.

Strider sits apart, watching, not sure if the humans have lost their minds.

STRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US

He looks like a scarecrow except he's dressed in captured ape armor. Rigged
to a flying fox, he speeds past a rock face. All of the tribes-people are
gathered on the side of a crevasse, watching.

The straw men flies closer - towards a rocky outcrop. Will touches a
burning ember to the ground. We see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but
we lose it among the rocks. A thin trail of smoke marks its passage.

The tribes-people watch - nothing seems to be happening. Suddenly - just as
the straw man reaches the outcrop -

Ka-boom! A huge explosion. Fire and flying rock hit the straw men.

The tribes-people scream. Terrified, they turn and run. Smoke and dust
obscure the flying fox. Will walks forward to examine his handiwork.

Tribes-people peer out from their hiding places - the smoke and dust clear.
They see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope.
Several of the women start to cry in fear.

Will stands on the edge of the crevasse. He turns - Kip, Aragorn and the
other leaders are approaching. They look at him with trepidation.

KIP

You make fire from rocks of the earth -what is this thing?

WILL

Gunpowder.

Kip turns to the others. They repeat the word, as if that will unlock its
mystery.

WILL (CONT'D)

We've still got work to do.

He turns and goes. The tribes-people, emboldened by their leaders, come
closer. They draw back from Will as he makes his way through them. He comes
face to face with Strider. The man and the ape look at one another.

STRIDER

Apes believe men are the devil's children. Maybe they're right. What have
you done, Will - what have you unleashed on the world?

WILL

Nothing, Strider. The future, that's all.

STRIDER

I can't fight with you tomorrow, Will. To kill an ape in a brawl is one
thing, but I can't go to war against my people.

WILL

(kindly)

I never expected you to.

Again they look at one another. Will turns and leaves.

WATER FLYING, HOOVES POUNDING

Drak and his cavalry, pennants flying, gallop along the edge of a river.
Ranks of infantry, followed by horse-drawn supply wagons, travel behind.

The river swings around a point thick with trees. We crane up above the
foliage - a tributary flows clown the other side. Marching through the
shallows is another army of apes. At their head, on a stallion, is Nazgul.

The two squadrons converge at the end of the point. The foot soldiers meld
together, the Praetorian Guard splash ahead, Drak and Nazgul ride side by
side. Ahead, the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge. It's
a natural weir -

THE FORD OF THE THREE RIVERS

A jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the
river. The Praetorian Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir.

The Guard spur their horses forward, forcing them through the fast-running
current, crossing to the other side -

IN THE TREES

A shadow of movement. Tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the
forest, almost invisible in skins and camouflage.

Will and Kip stand motionless, deep in shadow. They watch as the Guard on
their horses come thundering across the ford, straight towards them. The
infantry are close behind. Will drops his hand -

TRAILS OF FIRE

whip along the ground - out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks
that form part of the ford. The Guards' horses shy away. The apes look down
in puzzlement -

Boom! Boom! Booml Sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water.
Apes are cut to pieces, horses are hurled into the fast-flowing water.

On the far side - Orak's horse rears up. He drives his spurs into its
flanks, trying to control it. Clouds of dust and smoke billow across the
weir, the wounded are screaming - the ape cavalry wheel and turn in
confusion.

Drak plunges forward - chaos all around him. He pounds his chest with both
fists and roars -

DRAK

Apes - chargel

The apes still on their horses hear his cry. They spur their mounts
forward. The first of the cavalry reach -

THE SHORE

Boom... boom! More explosions rip the river bank to pieces.

IN THE FOREST

Batteries of cross-bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames. The
Eagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other, touching flames to
rope fuses. Fire sizzles towards the crossbows, each one loaded with a
charge -

Bam...bam...bamf The scores of crossbows fire.

ON THE FORD

The ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris. Wham! The hail
of arrows cut them to pieces.

Drak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses. He looks
through the smoke - into the forest. He sees Will, standing on a rock with
Kip, like a general commanding his army.

Drak bellows with rage. He snaps the reins, about to drive his horse
onward. An arrow flies in from the flank. Whackt It slams into Drak's chest
armor, splintering. He turns -

THE JUMBLE OF LOGS

floats in the middle of the river. The leader of the Rainbow Tribe, water
streaming off of him, kneels on the tangle of trees and branches, reloading
his bow. This is no jumble of logs - it's a firing platform they've
anchored therel

dozen Rainbow warriors, hidden in the water, clamber out of the river. They
kneel next to their leader, drlwing their bows -

THE FORD

Drak watches es I flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes.
Right in front of him, an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of
the Praetorian Guard. Drak turns to Nazgul, yelling -

DRAK

The ones in the river - take themi Nazgul spurs his horse back across the
weir.

ON THE SHORE

Ape cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank. Bam! They hear the
charges go off - the hurl themselves down. Another volley of arrows scythes
through them -

IN THE FOREST

The Eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the
batteries of crossbows. One of the warriors looks up - terror on his face.

Drak, followed by the remnants of his Praetorian Guard, charge through the
blue haze of gunsmoke - straight towards them.

One of the crossbow batteries fires! Arrows hit his horse's armor but Drak
doesn't falter. Crouched Iow in the saddle, he spins the Gatling gun like a
gunslinger. He locks it under his arm.

The eagle warriors start to break and run. The apes' horses sound like
thunder rolling closer. The Eagle leader and several of his warriors stand
their ground, desperately working to reload.

They spin the battery, sighting straight at Drak's chest. They fire! Arrows
fly -

Drak leaps out of the saddle! He catches hold of an overhanging bough. The
arrows whiz underneath, skimming his butt. He leaps again - higher into the
tree.

The Eagle leader looks up - sunlight sparkles on the leaves. It's dazzling
-

Smash! Drak's sword cleaves through one of the warriors. Drak has dropped
to the ground, right behind them. The Eagle leader turns - too latel
Rat-a-tat-tat! The Gatling gun fires. Arrows shred the Eagle leader's
feathered coat. He crumples to the ground like some fallen bird.

THE FORD

The ape infantry pour across the ford, charging over the bodies of their
fallen comrades.

THE FOREST

Riderless horses, part of the ape cavalry, charge wildly through the trees.
We tilt up - their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees. The
branches are thick with apes firing, cutting down groups of running
tribesmen.

THE ROCK PLATFORM

Will and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron
barrel wedged in the rocks. One of the warriors tilts it up, aiming it at
the trees; another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel.

Will touches an ember to a fuse. Everyone dives for cover -

Boom! The primitive cannon fires. The shrapnel hits the trees. Shredded
apes, branches and leaves fall to the ground.

Will and the warriors reload. Again they fire - but the charge is too big.
The whole cannon breaks free of the rocks. It flies like a missile and
smashes into the trunk of a tree. Timber!

A ROCKY GORGE

Its rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders. Aragorn and a group
of warriors are fighting hand-to-hand, being forced back by scores of ape
infantry.

Aragorn drives his spear at a huge ape. The point plunges into the animal's
belly, up and under his armor. Blood spurts out from the joins in the
metal.

IN THE TREES

An ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow - straight at Aragorn. He
fires -

AMONG THE BOULDERS

Wham! The crossbow bolt smashes into Aragorn's shoulder, sending him
reeling. One of the tribesmen turns - it's Kip. He sees Aragorn on his
knees.

Kip wields a sword, fighting his way towards Aragorn. Slash! He takes one
ape across the chest. Whaml Another ape in the neck. He grabs Aragorn and
starts to drag him out of the melee.

IN THE TREES

The ape sharpshooter has Kip in his sights. His finger reaches for the
trigger. He starts to squeeze -

Sswhishl The sound of an arrow. Whackl It buries itself in the
sharpshooter's neck. He falls out of the tree -

HIGH AMONG THE BOULDERS

Will. He stands almost at the top of the gorge, lowering a crossbow. He
looks down at Kip's men - the apes, vastly superior in numbers, are
swarming forward, driving the tribesmen back.

On a ridge below him, four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder. A
flash of fire then - Ka-bam!

ON THEGROUND

Apes are rushing forward. They hear the explosion. Several apes turn - the
huge boulder, split into chunks, flies towards them. The apes scatter.
Smashl The chunks knock apes aside like skittles.

But there's more of them behind, spilling in to the gorge, over-running it
-

THE DUST FROM THE EXPLOSION

swirls past Drak. He looks up - he sees Will on the ridge, silhouetted
against the sky.

Drak snarls deep in his throat. He wheels his horse and gallops hard
towards a trail that winds up among the boulders.

ON THE RIDGE

Will moves fast along the top of the ridge. He stops - looking down on the
river. On the other side, Nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather
bladders from the wagons and empty them into the river.

Will shades hil ayes - the water glistens with iridescent colors. He
realizes - it's oil.

The current carries it straight towards the platform in the river. The
warriors of the Rainbow tribe - unaware - are still aboard, firing at the
apes on the ford.

Will turns fait - wa whip pan along the shoreline. He sees what he feared -
two apes below him with a fire burning. They slot flaming arrows into their
crossbows -

Will unslings his crossbow, steadies himself and fires -

Ks-whack! The arrow rips through one ape's neck. He pitches forward -
heed-first into the fire. The other ape hurls himself aside, diving for
cover.

Will re-loads. The side of the ape's head is just visible behind a rock. If
Will makes this, it's going to be a helluva shot.

His finger curls around the trigger - right behind him, the sound of
hooves. Will spins

it's Drak charging towards him. He raises the Gatling gun -

Will aims at the big ape's throat and fires.

Drak swerves. The arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed
forearm. The Gatling gun flies from his hand.

There's no time for Will to re-load - he turns and runs.

Drak charges down on him. He draws a harpoon out of its scabbard.

Will scrambles over a crest - nothing but thin air!

Drak has him square in his sights. He draws back his arm, about to hurl the
harpoon. Will throws himself forward -

THE SIDE OF A CLIFF

Will falls down, down, down.

Drak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge. He looks over - Will
plunges towards the river, flowing fast below the ford.

Splash! Will cannonballs into the water and disappears. Drak stares down,
trying to catch sight of him. Nothing.

IN THE RIVER

A tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current.
A pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it. Will's head
follows.

Gasping, catching his breath, he looks upstream - the water pours over the
weir. A flaming arrow arcs through the air. The ape on the shore has done
his job -

THE OIL SLICK

erupts in flames as the arrow hits it. The whole surface of the river is
suddenly transformed into a raging blaze.

The Rainbow leader and his men turn. They see a wall of flame racing
towards them. Several warriors dive into the water, swimming for the shore
-

Whoosh! The flames engulf them. A wall of fire sweeps over the wooden
platform. Like macabre shadows - we see the dancing shapes of the dying
warriors.

IN THE RIVER

The current pulls Will down the river. He looks back - the molten fire
spills over the weir. Anguished screams are carried on the wind. A pillar
of black, oily smoke rises up high into the sky -

THE EAGLES' NEST

The platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women, children and
old folks. Diamond and Strider stand together. All of them stare down at
the river valley. The pillar of smoke rises higher.

WOMAN (O.S.)

They're here!

Diamond turns - the woman is standing on the highest platform. Diamond
follows the direction of her outstretched arm.

A group of warriors, followed by their women-folk and children, are coming
round the mountain path. Their leader wears a golden fur and a head-dress
of auroch's horns. It's the Tribe of the Antelope.

OUTSIDE THE MAIN CAVE

A chorus of chattering voices. The new arrivals are surrounded by members
of their sister tribes. The leader of the Antelope stands in the center,
listening to a woman -Kip's wife. Whatever she's saying is lost in the
hubbub.

ANTELOPE

Quiet!

Instantly, the voices die.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

(anxious)

Where?

Kip's wife doesn't answer - she walks forward and points to the pillar of
smoke. The Antelope leader turns to his warriors.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

We go - now!

DIAMOND AND STRIDER

stand on the platform, watching several old men lower the drawbridge.
Whack! It locks into place. The antelope warriors cross it and disappear
down a narrow trail.

The rest of the Antelope tribe move towards the cave. Diamond turns away -
then she stops. Something has caught her eye. She stares at the crowd of
women and children heading into the cave.

STRIDER

What is it?

Diamond doesn't answer - she tenses. In the milling crowd of brown bodies,
she sees it again - a flash of gold. It*s sunlight on blonde hair.

DIAMOND

She's here.., holy God - she's herel It's not a woman - it's a child!

She grabs a rope ladder, ignores the rungs and slithers down it.

A YOUNG GIRL

helps her mother set up camp. She is about 10 years old, tawny-haired,
taller and straighter-backed'than any of her people. She looks like us.

Diamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth. She
stops. The young girl turns. For a moment she and Diamond stare at one
another, separated by a hundred thousand years, but so similar they can
both see themselves in the other.

THE YOUNG GIRL SMILES. DIAMOND RETURNS IT -

DIAMOND

What's your name?

The girl's mother stares, amazed to see someone who looks like her child.

MOTHER

Her name is Aiv.

DIAMOND

Ev?

(Realizing)

Of course. My people have a name like that - "Eve" is how we say it.

The mother nods - the sound seems to please her. Diamond puts out her arms
and indicates the young girl. The mother smiles, giving her permission.
Diamond puts her arms around Eve.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

I've come a long way to find you.

Eve looks at her - wide-eyed, innocent.

EVE

Why?

DIAMOND

To keep you safe.

She holds her tight. The mother catches Diamond's eye.

MOTHER

Do you have children?

Diamond shakes her head - no. The mother can't hide her disappointment.

DIAMOND

What's wrong?

MOTHER

I was hoping you had a son. Aiv's a sweet girl. She's the child of my
heart. But the way she looks, nobody will want her as a mate.

Before Diamond can answer there's a commotion outside the cave. She turns
to look - Strider and tribes-people are running out into the daylight.

SWIRLS OF DUST

rise up from I mountain path. Whatever's causing it is hidden from view by
the peaks and crags. The tribal-people gather on vantage points, watching
it come closer. Strider cocks his head - listening. A shadow of fear passes
across his face.

STRIDER

Horses! It's horses!

Horses mean apesi Panic sweeps through the tribes-people. Women grab their
children, young kids start screaming, old men and boys scramble for
weapons.

Diamond weaves through the flying mass of people. She swings up on to a
platform beside Strider. He points -

Coming into view on the mountain path - running and stumbling, dragging
their wounded - are what's left of the Antelope warriors.

Their women-folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates.
The warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge. Nobody raised
it when they left -

Several old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it. They haul on
the ropes and pulleys. It starts to swing upwards -

Here he comes - Drak! He's galloping hard at the head of his cavalry,
battle scarred and bloodied. He sees the drawbridge starting to lift. He
doesn't pause - he whips his horse into a thundering gallop.

The bridge rises higher. Drak's horse leaps! It soars across the crevasse -
the giddylng drop stretches out below - and lands on the lifting bridge.

The men and boys stare in horror. Orak charges down on them. They back away
-all except one boy, not even in his teens, who stands his ground.

Swish! Drak's sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist. The other tribesmen
run. Wham! The drawbridge falls back into place. The ape cavalry charge
across it.

BROAD WOODEN PLATFORM

An ape horseman flies across the platform. He leaps off the edge, on to a
lower platform. Diamond's right in front of him!

She throws herself aside, grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto -

A ROCK SHELF

She looks across the broad area in front of the cave - apes everywhere,
weapons flashing, people screaming.

A young boy tries to out-run an ape warrior - it's Gray Beard. The young
boy hasn't got a chance. Gray Beard lashes out at him with a stock-whip.

It curls around the boy's ankle, tripping him. The boy looks up - he tries
to shield his face. Too late! The horse's hooves smash down -

Diamond looks away, unable to watch. She sees Eve. The young girl is at the
front of the cave, spinning in panic. Her mother runs towards her...

The mother doesn't see Gray Beard galloping towards her. Diamond screams a
warning but it's just one more crv in the commotion.

Gray Beard raises a short-handled lance and hurls it like a javelin. It
hits the mother in the small of the back, straight through the spine. She
pitches forward - dead. Eve screams and runs towards her mother.

Diamond leaps off the rock ledge -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Diamond runs faster than she's ever run, sprinting to grab Eva. Drak wheels
his horse - he sees Diamond. His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the
Blue Eyes! And a woman! He leaps his horse forward -

DRAK

Grab the female!

Gray Beard is off his horse. Diamond runs towards him. He raises a
crossbow...

Drak charges down on her from behind. He holds the harpoon at his shoulder.
He aims at her legs.

Diamond races on - her only thought, to save Eve. It'll never happen -
she's as good as deadGray Beard's in front, aiming. Drak's right behind. He
hurls the harpoon.

Whoosh! Strider swings through the air. He clings to one of the rope
ladders - it's like Tarzan, except he's an ape. He grabs Diamond by the
scruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way.

Drak's harpoon skims past them. Gray Beard stares in amazement at the woman
flying through the air. But that's not his big surprise - with Diamond out
of the way, the harpoon is flying straight at him. He screams as it rips
into his throat.

HIGH ROCK LEDGE

Strider - Diamond clutched under his arm - lands on a ledge high above the
fight. Diamond turns fast and looks back -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Eve crouches over the body of her mother. The woman's mouth is frozen in an
anguished scream, her dead eyes stare straight ahead. Eva shakes her,
desperately hoping for some sign of life. Nothing. Eve starts to cry.

A dark shadow falls across her. She looks up - it's Drak. He reaches down
and grabs her by the neck. He beats his chest with his fist and raises her
up above his head like a trophy.

ON THE ROCK LEDGE

Diamond, anguished, tries to go to the little girl but Strider holds her in
an iron grip. He swings Diamond off her feet, and leaps for an overhanging
branch of a tree. He jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from
sight.

CHARRED AND SMOKING WRECKAGE

floats at the shore of the river. It is what remains of the firing platform
- the bodies of several of the Rainbow warriors still on board.

Smoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest. The only
sound is the whinnying of a horse - it has a broken leg. Again and again it
tries to get to its feet.

A solitary figure makes his way through the shadows. It's Will, soaking wet
from the river. He stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at
the carnage all around him. So much for knowledge and science. This is
where the warriors of the tribes made their last stand - their bodies lie
huddled together in a jumble.

Will stares at them, anguish on his face.

WILL

(softly, to himself)

I was so sure...

He kneels and turns one of the bodies over. It's Kip - speared through the
chest. A shaft of sunlight hits the Crescent of Light. It glints on his
lifeless throat. Gently, he closes Kip's glassy eyes.

sound behind him. Will hurls himself aside, grabbing for a weapon. He looks
up -it's the Lookout, battle-stained and weary. Their eyes meet -

LOOKOUT

(quietly)

You said we'd win.

Will just nods - he knows.

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

You gave us hope - that was the cruelest thing.

The Lookout kneels and crosses Kip's hands across his chest. He reaches
down and removes the Crescent of Light. He turns to Will -

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

Get the weapons you need. The apes'Il be coming back for their dead. Hurry!

Will arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

rise into the sky - the eagle's nest is on fire. Drak and his apes make
their way along a narrow mountain trail - they've put the humans' camp to
the torch.

With them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly, many of
them in tears. They carry long poles over which are slung their dead and
dying. We crane, up to -

HUGE ROCK OVERHANG

high up the mountain-side. Standing underneath it, hidden in shadow, are
Diamond and Strider. They look down on the mountain trail. Diamond sees
Eve.

THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL

The young girl stumbles along the road, tied by a length of chain to Drak's
saddle. She's bruised and bleeding, her ankles shackled, barely able to
walk.

THE ROCK OVERHANG

Diamond looks at her, close to tears, but there's nothing she can do. She
watches the convoy wind along the trail.

Boomi The fire must have hit a store of gunpowder - an explosion rips
through the eagle's nest, blowing out the side of one of the peaks. Diamond
watches the dust climb into the sky. All her hopes seem to be going with
it.

IN THE RIVER

It's twilight. Will and the Lookout are wading around a knob of land that
protects one end of a tiny beach.

Will sees a fire burning on the sand, a cave opening off the beach, piles
of stones like burial mounds.

WILL

What is this place?

LOOKOUT

It's called the Crossroads of the Fallen King - it's where our forefathers
are laid to rest. It's sacred to us - anyone who's still alive will make
their way here.

They wade closer to the beach. In the firelight they see groups of
tribesmen -survivors of the battle. Women and children - the lucky few who
managed to flee the eagle's nest - are binding the warriors' wounds.

They look up - everyone falls silent at the sight of Will. As he comes
closer he recognizes a woman, sitting alone -

WILL

It's Kip's wife. She's come from

THE EAGLE'S NEST -

He goes towards her, passing the other tribes-people. Nobody greets him.
They just watch him pass. He stops in front of Kip's wife. Her eyes are red
from crying.

WILL

rm sorry about your mate.

She says nothing - she just stares at him. Will keeps going -

WILL (CONT'D)

I've been to the eagle's nest. I was looking for the woman I was with. We
searched but...

(he pauses)

What happened - was she captured?

KIP'S WIFE

I threw myself off a platform. I don't know what happened to anyone.

Will nods. He gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire. We
don't hear what he says, but we know what he is asking. One after another
they shake their heads - no, they know nothing of Diamond.

SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT

shimmers on the water. Will sits on a rock that straggles into the water.
His face is grim, his heart heavy with grief. He's making something with
his hands - twisting and turning them - but in the dim light we can't see
what it is.

INSIDE THE CAVE

A shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their
end - it's like Stonehenge. The surviving tribes-people are gathered in
their shadow.

OLD MAN

It's half a day since the battle. Any that survived would be here by now -
we are all that remains of the Seven Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the
field. We must decide ourselves what to do.

Silence for a moment. They have spent too long following a leader for
discussion to come easily. Finally, a wounded warrior speaks -

WOUNDED WARRIOR

Like you say, Kip is dead. Maybe it's a sign -the Rangers have left Middle
Earth forever. Perhaps it's telling us to do the same.

A young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head.

YOUNG WOMAN

Leave the valley? This is where the eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody
can live without their totem - we all know that!

LOOKOUT

Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here, we die. But if we
travel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we've got a chance. Who knows - maybe
our totems will follow us?

There's a murmur of agreement. It grows louder, tribes-people nodding their
heads.

THE BEACH

Now we see what Will has been making - it's a boat made out of twigs and
leaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast. He leans forward and drops it
in the water. He watches the current carry it away. Farther and farther it
bobs out into the river -

WILL

(softly)

I'm sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it wasn't our war. All you
wanted was a baby...

He can't go on. He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land.

IN THE RIVER

The current carries the boat past a jagged boulder. An ape's hand reaches
out and picks it up. He lifts it up to look more closely. We see his face -
it's Strider. He turns the toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically.
He hands it to Diamond, wading along behind him -

STRIDER

It looks like someone made it.

DIAMOND

It's a boat - it's gaff-rigged.

(realizing)

Oh, Jesus...

She plunges forward, wading as fast as she can.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Will!

ON THE BEACH

Will is walking up the beach. He stops, listening. He hears it again -his
name! He turns and heads towards the river. He sees Diamond coming round
the headland, splashing through the water.

Will stops. They look at one another - then they both move forward, arms
stretching out. They wrap their arms around each other.

WILL

(softly)

I thought I'd lost you.

DIAMOND

I thought you were dead.

They keep holding each other.

WILL

How did you find this place?

DIAMOND

Strider. His father was a tracker. We've been following a trail for hours.

Will looks over her shoulder - Strider is wading towards them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

He saved my life, Will.

Will goes to greet him. The man and the ape embrace.

WILL

Thank you, my friend - thank you.

STRIDER

What did you expect? You would have done the same for me.

SHOWER OF SPARKS

as Will puts a log on the fire. From inside the cave we hear the murmur of
voices as the argument goes back and forth.

Both Diamond and Strider are wrapped in furs - their clothes are laid out
next to the fire, drying. Will speaks to Diamond -

WILL

Some times when we want something so bad, we can take a thing and twist it
in our head. You're sure about this, Billie?

DIAMOND

I'm pregnant, Will - I'm not crazy. She's not like them - she's a mutation.
Evolution's always trying to improve on itself. It's turned out a child
that can walk taller and run faster, one whose brain-pan holds a mind that
can think laterally. I've seen her, Will. I've held her in my arms - she
was us.

Will looks at her. There's no doubt - he believes her.

WILL

You said she was with Drak.

DIAMOND

On a chain.

WILL

It's two days' march to the city. Was she wounded - can she make it?

DIAMOND

She can make it.

(a beat - she looks at him)

Will?

Before he can answer, the Old Man and several others come down the beach -

OLD MAN

It's decided - we're leaving the valley forever.

(turns to Strider)

Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken.
Long may their spirits haunt you

(he turns back to Will)

You and your mate can travel with u but we've got misery enough to carry.
Our hearth is not home to ny ape.

WILL

Then it's not home to us. The ape's better than any man I've known.

The Old Man's lip curls in a sneer. He shrugs and walks away.

STRIDER

Go with them. Will - everyone needs their own kind.

Will and Diamond newer almost simultaneously -

WILL

No!

DIAMOND

Of course we can't...

(to Will)

The city, Will.

Will and Strider turn nd look at her - incredulous.

WILL

We call it a city - it's more like a fortress, Billie. It can't be done.

DIAMOND

The three of you got out - everyone thought that was impossible too.

WILL

We were lucky. But that's the trouble with luck - it runs out. I don't want
to be back in the city when it does.

DIAMOND

What about Eve - what do we do, just forget about her?

WILL

No. Maybe we can't stop the apes giving her the disease - but they'll have
to turn her loose. That's the only way she can infect others. So we lay a
plan and we find her. Then it's our job to stop her having children. If we
can do that, it can't be passed on through the race.

She shrugs That's the only thing I can think of.

DIAMOND

How long will that take - less than twenty-five days ?

WILL

No.

DIAMOND So what of my child?

We have to face it - you're going to lose it.

She turns away, trying to keep her emotions in check. Will comes to her
side -

WILL (CONT'D)

We can't take our eye off the goal. If we solve this, you can have other
children. Not if wa throw our lives away, though.

DIAMOND

Whose, Will - whose children?

She looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.

WILL

guess that's your call.

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us
great. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?
What would you do if it was your child?

She looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -

WILL

I don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to
getting into the city. I just don't know...

He picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

It sits on a river. There's only one bridge -heavily guarded. Even if we
could cross it, all the ridges and roads are patrolled -

STRIDER

There's one place that's not.

Both Diamond and Will turn to him. He takes the stick -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Down here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.
From there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to
cross the river.

He draws an arrow across the water, illustrating the problem. Diamond is
about to speak but she looks at Will - he's staring at the arrow, an idea,
half formed, is starting to form.

WILL

Maybe there is a way...across the river, I mean.

DIAMOND

How?

Will turns to her -

WILL

You'll love it - there's barely any science to it at all.

DIAMOND

We're going? Is that right - we're going!?

Their eyes meet and hold. He smiles at her.

THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and
Strider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney.

STRIDER

They've started up the furnace.

(softly)

Let the games begin.

DIAMOND

What games?

WILL

The apes kill their prisoners for sport. The furnace takes care of the
bodies.

Diamond - sickened by it - turns to look at Will. Already he's heading off,
leading them down nrrow trail.

A HIDDEN LEDGE

much closer to the city. Will and the others move fast along it, deep in
the shadows. The river thunders by below them, separating them from the
city. The only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge. Ape guards
patrol it.

Only Diamond pauses to look et it. Will and Strider urge her forward. It
disappears from view.

A STEEL ARROW

flies through the air. Tied to its shaft, trailing out behind, is a rope
made from vines. Will lowers a crossbow. He watches the arrow fly through
the mist and spray -

THE RIVER

races by just below and pours over the Falls of No Return. Whack! The arrow
buries itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank.

ON THE OTHER SHORE

Will and Strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree. It stretches
from one side of the river to the other. All it has to do is hold. Will
turns to Diamond. He shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls -

WILL

You first. We'll be right behind.

Diamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope. She
looks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind-blown spray;
the roaring water rushes by; the rope hangs like a thread. There's fear on
her face -

WILL (CONT'D)

You ready?

DIAMOND

It sure as shit ain't Kansas, is it?

WILL

Go!

Diamond throws herself forward. Her feet leave the platform. Hand over hand
she goes - out across the river.

Will watchel for a moment then launches himself - his hands wrap around the
rope.

Strider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps. The line bows
under his weight. Diamond'l feet drop closer to the water. She looks down -
the mass of black water, flecked with foam, rushes past.

Will looks ahead - Diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray. She's
dripping wet, hauling herself forward -

The sound of the Falls is deafening. Right below her, a huge, swirling
"hole" opens up. It's a whirlpool. She starts to swing across it. Joltl

THE TREE TRUNK

The arrow pulls part way out of the tree. The steel shaft shivers but it
holds. Everything seems okay. Suddenly -

Snap! One of the strands of the vine breaks -

ON THE ROPE

Everything bucks and shudders. Diamond screams. She looks down - straight
into the vortex of the whirlpool. Her blood runs cold - she freezes.

WILL SEES HER HANGING MOTIONLESS ON THE ROPE. HE SCREAMS AT HER -

WILL

Go! Billie - go!

She doesn't seem to hear. Her eyes are wide with fear - staring down, down
into the whirlpool's bottomless well.

WILL, TRYING TO GET TO HER, HURLS HIMSELF FORWARD. THE ROPE STRAINS AND
BOWS -

WILL

Move!

She doesn't react. Strider watches as Will tries to catch up. The rope is
swaying so much it's agonizingly slow.

Diamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness. The whirlpool
seems to be swallowing everything, even the moonlight -

WILL (CONT'D)

Billiai What about the baby?!

The word hits her. She pulls her eyes from the swirling death. She looks at
Will.

WILL (CONT'D)

Move, Billiel Nowl

She understands. She starts to pull herself forward. Will slumps with
relief -

ON THE SHORE

The arrow moves another inch out of the trunk. The rope fixed to its shaft
is strained to breaking point. But still everything holds...

THE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

One of the guards patrols the bridge. Out of the corner of his eye - flash
of something. He looks towards the Falls.

GUARD

(calling)

Gimla.

The other guard joins him. They peer through the night at the spray rising
from the Falls. They see it again - above the river, a flash of light on
metal.

The keep watching. An eddy of wind clears the mist for a second. They see
Strider going hand over hand along the rope, moonlight glinting on his
crossbow.

ON THE SHORE

Another strand of the rope breaks. We follow it as it unravels - past
Diamond and Will. Before we get to Strider it stops - a section of the rope
is so badly frayed it can't go any farther. It's going to break any moment.

Screech! A siren wails.

STRIDER

They've seen usl Will looks up-river to the bridge. Through a hole in the
mist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling. A whole squadron runs to join
them.

Diamond throws herself forward - she makes the shorel

Will and Strider give it everything they've got. Strider's first hand
passes the frayed section. He's following it with his second -

Snap! The whole rope breaks. Will - closest to the shore - plunges into the
ripping current. But at leaIt he's clinging to the rope with both hands.
Strider's in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of
one paw. Will turns and reaches for him.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

No! Save yourselfl

ON THE SHORE

Diamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in. The
weight - of the men and the current - make it impossible. All she can do is
try and hold them.

ON THE ROPE

Strider's fingers are slipping free. Will grabs him - man and ape, hand to
paw. Will holds him.

STRIDER

We'll both die. Let gol Will shakes his head - no. Hanging on to the rope
one-handed, the current tearing at his body, he tries to haul Strider in.

Whizz! An arrow flies past, just missing them, and plunges into the water.
The apes on the bridge are firing.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Another minute, we'll both be dead. Do it, Willl

Will tries again to drag Strider to the rope. Another arrow flies through
the mist and spray - even closer. Strider reaches out with his free hand.
He starts to prize Will's fingers loose -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

If nothing else, I made it to the Falls No Return.

Will realizes - nothing is going to stop Strider.

WILL

The sacred words, Strider - what are the words?!

STRIDER

"In the beginning...

WILL

'In the beginning was the word and the word wes God...'

STRIDER

(in wonder)

You know the words?

WILL

You'll walk in the next world, Strider.

STRIDER

How do you know?

WILL

I've seen the future, haven't I?

Strider smiles at him - a smile of perfect peace.

STRIDER

Good-bye Will. Take care of Billie.

He twists Will's last finger free. He drops - the swirling river carries
him away. Will is close to tears, but he won't let himself cry. Two more
arrows sizzle past -

WILL

And the word was God. Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I
will fear no evil...

Strider spins down the river, through the spray and foam.

WILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.

Strider, one arm raised, plunges over the Falls.

ON THE BRIDGE

We see who's been coordinating the firing. It's Drak. Archers are kneeling
on the bridge, trying to sight a target through the foaming water and
clouds of mist.

Drak, never taking his eyes off of the river, draws back the massive spring
of his crossbow and reloads.

ON THE SHORE

Diamond ia hauling on the rope, pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in
water, tows himself along it. His feet find a footing - he starts to
scramble up the bank. Diamond goes towards him -

Just for a moment, the mist clears.

ON THE BRIDGE

moment's long enough. Drak's seen him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his
aim and fires -

ON THE SHORE

Diamond is almost in Will's arms. Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU's back,
through his ribs. He pitches forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her
arms.

The mist closes around them.

HUGE STONE ARCH

The survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail. All of
them are burdened down with possessions, weary from the road - they are
leaving the valley.

Kip's Wife and the Old Man are in the lead. They pass through the arch, out
into a clearing. In the middle of it is a fire, shadows camped around it -

Kip's wife and the other survivors stop in fear. One of the shadows rises
from the. fire. Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards
them. It's Aragorn!

Kip's wife moves forward and embraces him -

KIP'S WIFE

We thought you were dead.

ARAGORN

Hunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -

He indicates his men. They are coming forward, greeting the survivors. The
Young Woman sees her mate - she cries out. They hold each other.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

For three days a squadron of apes have tracked us. Last night we ambushed
them. We're heading now for the eagle's nest.

KIP'S WIFE

(softly)

There is no eagle's nest.

Aragorn stares at her, not wanting to believe it.

KIP'S WIFE (CONT'D)

We're all that's left of the Seven Tribes.

Grief wells up inside Aragorn. We hold on his face.

A FIRE CRACKLES

All of the tribes-people are gathered around it.

OLD MAN

There is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the Ranger.

ARAGORN

(shaking his head)

No. We must all follow the trail we think best. You've decided yours. For
me * I'll go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can. I'll go
alone - but like the traveler, I think death will be the only thing I find
there.

OLD MAN

Then it will find us, too. Warriors follow their Ranger. That's always been
the way of it in Middle Earth.

ARAGORN

But nothing's the same now. Think of the women-folk. What will become of
them?

KIP'S WIFE

You're right - there's so few of us now, nothing is the same. You must
allow the women to follow, too.

ARAGORN But women can't fight.

KIP'S WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight. That doesn't mean they
can't.

All the women nod their assent. The men smile, agreeing. Everyone waits for
Aragorn to decide. A beat - then he nods his head and smiles.

The tribes-people start to cheer. The Lookout steps forward. From out of
the folds of his fur, he takes the Crescent of Light. All of the tribe
stare at it.

LOOKOUT

I found it on the battlefield. There were those who said the Rangers had
left Middle Earth forever - I didn't know what to do with it.

He hands it to Aragorn. The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again
ties the talisman of his rank around his neck.

ARAGORN

Douse the fire. The Seven Tribes are going to war.

ON THE SHORE

The apes, carrying torches, search the river bank and surrounding cliffs.
We push in on a pool of darkness behind them -

Will and Diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree.
They have done their best to dress Will's wound but he's obviously in a lot
of pain -

DIAMOND

You can't go on, Will - not like this.

WILL

What about the baby?

DIAMOND

I'll keep going - I'll try and get Eve.

WILL

Alone? Don't be ridiculous -

He starts to haul himself to his feet. His face twists in pain - he has to
stop.

DIAMOND

Look at you - you can barely walk.

He puts out his hand, needing I boost up.

WILL

If I can just get up - help me.

Diamond shakes her head - no. They look at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

Don't do this to me - pleasel

DIAMOND

You've done enough - more than anyone else could. You're one of the finest
men

I've ever known - but it's over, Will. You're going to have to wait. Now
it's my turn -

She grabs her weapons and starts to leave. Will makes it to his feet -

WILL

Billie!She's almost through the tangled roots.

WILL (CONT'D)

I made a mistake once - I went on a journey with someone I loved. At the
end, I let her go into danger alone.

Diamond stops.

DIAMOND

Where was that - Berkeley, Will?

She turns and looks at him. He nods his head - yes.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What happened?

WILL

I knew I'd found the chemical key. I was working with three young
researchers. One of them was a woman called Ali Conoily. We were engaged.
They were the ones that went into the tanks. I didn't know as much as I
thought I did. They died in there.

DIAMOND

Why didn't you go, Will?

WILL

We all wanted to. It was a great adventure. Wa drew lots for it. I should
never have agreed, but we were young - and like the young we thought life
would last forever.

DIAMOND

Robert Plant died too, didn't he - in a way?

WILL

The experiment was unauthorized. There was an inquiry. They said the theory
had no basis. 'Ludicrous" was a word they used. My career had gone up like
a rocket. It came down like the stick. I couldn't find work anywhere

DIAMOND

"Will Robinson" - that was your joke, I guess. You were Lost in Space, were
you?

WILL

Yeah, but I never realized it'd be so appropriate.

They sort of smile at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

had twenty years to work out where my research went wrong - so what,
though. It was just a mind game. But I've learnt a lot of things - the most
important is that sometimes you get a second chance. A second chance for a
lot of things -

He looks straight at her. They hold each other's eyes.

WILL (CONT'D)

And when you do, you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go.
I've got the heart, Billie. It's my body that's failing me.

Neither one of them moves. A beat.

DIAMOND

Give me your hand, Will.

She helps him to his feet.

A GIANT CHASM

It's several hours before dawn. In the gloom - whooshl Kip's Wife rides a
flying fox across a precipitous drop.

She lands on the other side of a jagged ravine. The rest of the tribe, all
heavily armed, are waiting there. They turn end run, fading into the trees.

THE FUNERAL ROCK

juts out into the roaring river. Will and Diamond scramble out of the
darkness and land on the rock. Will's face is haggard with pain but he
forces himself forward. He's loosening up. going faster as he moves -

They pass through the huge legs of the stone ape - into the Temple.

A DARKENED ROOM

Torches flicker on the walls. From somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear
the sound of a crowd. A young ape, barely in his teens, stands in the
middle of the room, almost naked. His face is painted with strange ochre
markings.

A circle of ape warriors watch as Ma-Gog lifts a slender blade. Intoning
words in some strange tongue, he slices the blade across the Teenager's
forehead. The Teenager winces but he doesn't cry out - this is his manhood
ceremony.

THE STABLES

The sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we don't see them. The
prisoners from the Eagle's Nest are crowded into the corrals.

One of the gates is thrown open. Three ape guards enter. They push the
tribes-people aside and grab a 12-year old boy. His mother clings to him,
screaming. One of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the
corral.

AN ARENA

-like a small bullring - in the center of the stables. Now we see the crowd
- apes, all males, sit in the bleachers. They roar as a door is opened and
the young Tribe-Boy is pushed into the ring.

He looks around the arena - yelling, screaming apes. Terror on his face. An
even louder roar goes up. The Boy turns -

The Teenage ape steps out of a tunnel, the ochre markings on his face like
war-paint, the blood barely dried on his forehead. He carries spears and a
club.

One of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the Boy.
The Teenage ape moves in on him. He is a warrior now - this is going to be
his first kill.

IN THE CORRAL

The Boy's mother is huddled down, being comforted by other tribes-people. A
huge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck. The sound
carries over to -

A TERRACE

Drak is alone, walking a high ridge. He stops, looking down on the
twinkling lights. The city is virtually deserted but Drak doesn't move -
he's uneasy, troubled by something he can't put a name to.

THE COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

The five baby apes sit on cots. They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe
into the smallest ape's arm. The baby starts to cry. Doctor Zora comforts
her as she draws out a cup of blood. She turns to her assistant, Ben-Guri

DOCTOR ZORA

Is the girl animal ready?

BEN-GURI

They're doing it now.

INSIDE THE LABORATORY

Eve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an
operating table. He and another guard start to strap her down.

The Vet works at the bench, heating a steel needle over a flame. It's the
same sort of catheter that was used on Will - one end of the needle
attached to a long tube. A knock on the door.

VET

That must be Zors with the blood.

One of the guards goes and unbolts the door. He recoils - it's Will.
Sswhack! He fires the first bolt from a double-barreled crossbow. It takes
the guard in the chest.

He and Diamond dive into the room. Eve starts hollering. The second guard
is wheeling, crossbow rising. He rifle-butts Diamond across the head. Her
weapon goes flying.

The guard is aiming. Will is on the floor, tumbling. Barely time to aim, on
his back, firing overhead, he shoots -

Whack! Bullseye. The arrow hits the guard dead in the heed.

The Vet grabs the first guard's fallen crossbow. He aims at Will. Diamond
screams a warning but there's nothing Will can do - he's struggling to
reload, one-handed because of his wounds.

Diamond - unarmed - scoops the red-hot syringe off the bench. The Vet
reaches for the trigger. Diamond leaps forward. She drives the syringe into
his chest.

The Vet stands goggle-eyed. Diamond must have found his heart - a torrent
of blood pours down the clear tube. It spills on to the floor. The Vet
topples forward.

Slash! Slash! Will cuts throughthe straps that tie Eve to the table.

OUTSIDE THE HALL OF LEARNING

Drak turns a corner of the building. He stops and touches the ground with
his finger. He lifts it to his mouth and tastes it. He rises to his feet,
following trail of blood.

A TORCH

is ripped from a bracket. It's Drak.. He shines it down into a stone well.
The flame splits the darkness. Floating in the water at the bottom of the
well is an ape guard -dead, an arrow through his throat.

IN THE ARENA

The Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust, bleeding badly from a rip across his
ribs. His spear lies next to him, a wooden shield raised across his head.
The Teenage ape , rains blows down on it with a sword.

The apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly. Smash! The shield splinters.
The sword slices the Boy's arm -

APES

Kill! Kill! Kill!

The Boy stares up - the Teenage smiles and raises his sword.

Shriek! The alarm sounds. Everything freezes. Then officers are on their
feet, yelling orders. Ape soldiers grab their weapons, heading for the
doors.

The Teenage ape looks around, robbed of his moment. The Boy sees his
chance. He raises his spear and drives it deep into the ape's groin. He
staggers and falls - on top of the Boy.

The apes pour out of the arena. The siren carries over to -

A STONE CORRIDOR

Will's got Eve slung over his shoulder. They're stumbling down a corridor -
past other labs and research rooms. They burst through a sat of doors, into
-

A COURTYARD

at the back of the Hall of Learning. It's deep in shadow. From behind they
hear the sound of pounding feet. Will looks around, not sure which way to
go. He glances across a terrace - the doors to the stables fly open. The
ape warriors charge out.

WILL

Can you ride?

Diamond nods her head - yes. He thrusts Eve into her hands -

WILL (CONT'D)

Go for the stables. Head for the eagle's nest. I'll try to join you there.

Diamond hesitates - she doesn't want to leave him.

DIAMOND

What are you going to do?

WILL

Delay them. Now go, Billie. Go!

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

rops down the side of the ravine. Standing on it are Nazgul and about

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

a dozen Praetorian Guards. Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums
are lighting up the streets and terraces. Ape soldiers are running
everywhere - searching.

ON THE GROUND

The flame-thrower rolls along a street. The driver's canopy is hidden by
flapping tarpaulins. In the chaos nobody pays it any attention.

ON THE ELEVATOR

Nazgul sees the machine rolling towards them.

NAZGUL

That's strange - why does Drak need the Flame?

Suddenly he realizel. He turns, screaming up at the apes controlling the
mechanism.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Stopl Take it backl

THE FLAME-THROWER

dead guard is draped over the side of the machine, blood dripping from his
headWill is in the cabin, working the controls. He sees the elevator slow
in mid-descent. He throws a lever forward. For a moment, nothing. Then -

Whoosh! A huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel.

Two of the guards are trying to climb the ropes. Nazgul is wheeling around
in a panic. The flame hits them! The whole wooden structure catches fire.
We see the apes through the flames, struggling and writhing.

The ropes burn through. The blazing structure plummets down -

THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Smash! It hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes. Ape
soldiers - standing nearby - stare in shock. The smell of roasted ape fills
the air.

EVE SITS ALONE

She's on the floor of the stables, deep in shadow. She's scared, looking
ahead -

The first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors. We see an ape
guard, keys jangling from his waist, on petrol.

He hears something - a rock falling, a rustle of movement. Raising his
weapon, he moves towards a pool of black shadow, past a pile of rocks, into
an alcove.

Diamond rises out of the rocks behind him. He spins - she's got her
cross-bow raised. Point-blank range. She nails him.

THE PRISONERS

are shackled in the corrals. They see Diamond running out of the shadows
towards them. She tossel them the keys -

DIAMOND

Arm yourselves. Find Will - he needs youl She turns and goes. The prisoners
start to unlock the chains.

EVE

smiles as Diamond races out of the shadows, sweeps her up and keeps
running.

IN THE ARENA

The Teenage ape and the Boy lie where they fell, their spilt blood staining
the dust.

The Boy's mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son.
She drags off the ape. Her son's eyes are closed, his arms lacerated, his
chest wounded and crusted with blood. She stares at him - he doesn't move.

She starts to sob. The Boy's eyes flicker open. They look at one another.
The motheY gathers him into her arms. He's alive! He's alive!

The sound of a horse. The mother turns, fearful. She looks across the
arena, through a railing -

IN THE CORRALS

Diamond gallops a stallion through the corrals. Eve's clutching the saddle
in front of her - hair flying, her eyes sparkling with exhilaration. The
stallion gallops faster.

The prisoners - unchaining the last of their comrades - turn and look. It's
a magnificent sight. Diamond is crouched Iow over the flying horse.
Straight ahead - a railed fence, part of the corral.

She leaps the horse over it. They land. In front - another hurdle. Again
she does it.

The prisoners stare. Diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND FLAME

The crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire. Ape city is
burning.

The Flame stands on a steep incline, its back wedged against the wall of a
terrace. Whooshl Fire shoots out of its barrel as Will keeps a horde of ape
soldiers at bay.

The soldiers turn - Drak, surrounded by the Praetorian Guard, gallops
straight towards them. He'l not stopping for anything - the soldiers
scramble aside.

IN THE CABIN

Will sees Drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke.
They look like the horsemen of the apocalypse. As Will throws the lever we
sea a primitive gauge above his head. It's in the red -

IN THE SQUARE

Whoosh! The tongue of flame shoots through the smoke. It touches the guards
with a deadly kiss, throwing them screaming from their horses. But Drak
blasts through -

IN THE CABIN

Will is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke. He peers through it -
Drak charges towards him! Will hits the lever again. The flame erupts from
the barrel. Then it dies - out of fuel.

WILL

Shit!

IN THE SQUARE

Drak gallops forward. He raises weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon. He
aims -

IN THE CABIN

Will throws himself aside. He smashes both hands down on a lever on the
floor. A hiss of steam. The machine lurches forward -

IN THE SQUARE

Drak tries to get a clear shot at Will. The machine gathers speed down the
incline, coming straight towards Drak. He veers his horse aside and wheels
around. He charges alongside the cabin - it's empty

ON THE MACHINE

Will clings to the outside of the Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled
square. He's out of sight of Drak - but not for long. The ape and his
stallion loom into view behind the machine, Will scrambles back into the
cabin -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square. Drak is
at full gallop, veering from one side of the Flame to the other. Will
clambers back and forth - cat and mouse at full tilt.

Drak swings his horse close to the back of the machine. He stands up in the
stirrups, the harpoon clamped to his shoulder - he's going on board!

The Flame flies out of the square and down a street. An ape throws himself
into a doorway - just in time, Drak steadies himself, about to jump.
Suddenly his horse whinnies wildly. Drak looks ahead - holy shit!. They're
heading straight for the front of a blazing house.

Drak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins. Will hurls
himself back into the cabin, arms shielding his head. Smash! The Flame
crashes through the front wall -

INSIDE THE HOUSE

The barrel of the Flame acts like a battering ram - it blasts through the
walls in a shower of burning timbers. It crashes through the kitchen and
stops in a courtyard.

Will clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground. A yell goes up -
apes are coming through the adjoining houses. Will turns and heads down an
alleyway.

CITY STREET

Diamond's horse flies down a street - a high terrace towers on one side, a
row of burning buildings on the other. The road turns right. She swings
around it - apes! A platoon of them right in front of her. She screams at
Eve -

DIAMOND

Hold on!

She throws herself aside, pulling on the reins. The horse spins in a
U-turn, grazing past a burning building. Diamond gallops back the way she
came.

Crash! The wall of a burning building in front of her collapses. Blazing
beams block the road. The horse shies away. Diamond wheels him around -

The apes race into the road. She looks around desperately - she's trapped.
She grabs Eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her - she'll be safer
there.

She spurs the horse forward and crouches Iow in the saddle - she's going to
charge straight through the apes. They drop to one knee - the firing
position - and raise their weapons. A dozen crossbowl aim straight at
Diamond.

There's no way out - she flies towards them. Whizzl The sound of arrows.
But it's not the apes - they go down like nine-pins.

Diamond looks up - Aragorn has arrived! Backlit by the rising sun, the men
and women of the Tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes.
Nobody fires better than Kip's Wife.

Diamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the
road.

MA-GOG

stands on a terrace, his cloak blowing in the wind, his one cruel eye
blazing with anger. Flanked by two ape warriors, he looks down on the
burning buildings.

The freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables.

Ma-Gog sees Will - he's running along the rooftops, leaping from one
building to the next. Ma-Gog points at him, yelling at apes in the streets
below -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Kill him! In the name of God, kill himl Sswhish! The blade of a sword
cleaves through frame. It cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist.
Ma-Gog spins - it's Aragorn, armed to the teeth, behind them.

The second warrior goes for him. Aragorn has dropped the sword. He raises a
crossbow and fires. The bolt shatters the ape's armor and buries itself in
his chest.

Ma-Gog swirls aside his cloak. In his good hand he holds a double-edged
sword. Aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath Ma-Gog's arcing blow.
He lunges with a short-handled spear -

ARAGORN

For my people!

It takes Ma-Gog in the gut. His one eye bulges. Aragorn rips the spear out
-

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

And this - for my daughterl He drives the spear into the High Priest's
heart. The cruel eye flickers and dies.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will has seen it all. He screams -

WILL

Behind you! Aragorn - behind!

ON THE TERRACE

Aragorn turns. It's Drak, on horseback, thundering down on him. But the
leader of the Seven Tribes knows no fear - only the memory of his lost
child.

He raises his second spear and charges straight at Drak. The huge ape
levels the shoulder-mounted harpoon. He pulls the trigger. Sswang! The
powerful spring on the barrel releases, the harpoon trails a length of rope
behind it -

Wham! The harpoon smashes through Aragorn's chest. He dies as he falls.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will stares in anguish. He turns away - he sees Diamond. She's at full
gallop - Eve clinging to her back - charging along a road several terraces
below. She's got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom.

Will looks across at Drak - he's seen her too! For a moment the two of them
stare at one another. Will's face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he
carries.

Drak's lip curls in a sneer - he knows he's going to win. He beats his
chest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace,
going for Diamond.

Will runs as fast as his body will let him - along the rooftop.

INSIDE A HOUSE

An ape mother cowers in a corner, her two children clutched to her, the
sounds of battle all around. She looks up in terror -

Smash! Will's feet blast through the roof. He lands on the floor, crossbow
raised -but not st her. Framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on
horseback. Wham! Will shoots him and runs for the horse.

DIAMOND

and Eve fly down charred street .They head towards a large open square.

OUTSIDE THE STABLES

Smoke and dust swirl through the air. The freed prisoners are fighting ape
infantry. Drak races past the battle. The rope from the harpoon is tied
around the saddle, dragging Aragorn's body through the dust.

He looks ahead - Diamond gallops across the square. Drak whips his horse
forward -

A CURVED ROAD

on a high terrace. Flying around a corner - Will! His coat is billowing,
the horse's mane streaming in the wind. He hits the straight-away and
gallops even faster.

He looks down on the road below - Diamond is ahead but Drak is gaining on
her. Will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock.

ON THE ROAD

Eve clings tight to Diamond's waist. The little girl looks back - Drak is
thundering behind them, pennants snapping in the wind, armor glinting on
the horse's chest. It's an awesome sight.

Drak has the reins in his teeth. He's using both hands to reload the
harpoon.

Diamond sees the bridge dead ahead. Heavily armed apes have barricaded it.
She curses and yanks the bridle. The horse sweeps around an island in the
center of the road - a huge monument to some dead ape. She gallops back the
way she came, almost passing Drak. He charges round the island.

OUT OF THE TUNNEL

comes Will. He looks down to the lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming
back towards him! He turns the horse around - back into the tunnel.

Whooshl He flies out the other end, into daylight. He looks over his
shoulder - he's in front of them but thirty feet too high. He digs his
heels into the horse's flanks -over a Iow wall they fly. God knows where it
goes -

DOWN A ROCKY SUDE

into a dead-end cul-de-sac just above the roadway. Apesi Two of them are
guarding the Claw and the Bells. Will fires from the shoulder - he drops
the first ape.

The second ape aims at him. Will raises another crossbow. They fire almost
simultaneously. Will throws himself aside, out of the saddle. The horse
rears and bolts.

Will looks up from the dirt - the ape has Will's arrow embedded in his
chest. He falls forward - dead.

Will scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below. Diamond
and Eve - clinging to the horse for dear life - race towards him. Will
grabs a crossbow and struggles to reload. He can't - it takes the strength
of both arms to cock it,

ON THE ROAD

Diamond's horse is lathered in sweat, almost blown. Eve looks over her
shoulder, her eyes wide with fear - Drak is close behind, gaining at every
step.

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC

Will leaps from the Balls on to the Claw.

ON THE ROAD

Drak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder. He sights down the barrel. Eve
sees the weapon lock on to their backs. She screams a warning et Diamond -

EVE

Billie!

Diamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road. Drak
loses her in his sights. He follows her over the wagon.

ON THE CLAW

Will is in the driver's seat. He throws a lever - nothing happens. He tries
another -the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the
road.

DRAK

aims the harpoon. He's got Eve end Diamond, one behind the other, in his
sights.

DRAK

A bargain - two for the price of onel

ON THE CLAW

Will spins a small steering wheel.

ON THE ROAD

Drak is close behind Diamond. The harpoon's massive spring is coiled.
Drak's finger curls around the trigger, about to fire.

Suddenly he screams - dropping right in front, coming straight towards him,
are the opening jaws of the Claw.

WILL JERKS BACK ANOTHER LEVER -

WILL

Keep your hands off her, you dirty ape.

The jaws lock clean around Drak's waist, plucking him off the saddle and
lifting him up into the air. He's still got the harpoon. He sees Will at
the control. He swings the barrel round -

Will hits a switch. Wrong one - nothing happens.

Drak's got him in his sights. His finger finds the trigger -

Will throws another switch.

The jaws start to close! Drak tries to pull the trigger - he can't, his
body is twisting. The jaws are crushing him! He musters all of his strength
and tries to fire. He and Will look straight at one another. A beat. Drsk's
finger starts to slide off the trigger -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes stare up at their warrior lord, clamped in the Clew. He let out a
blood curdling scream. The bottom half of his torso - everything from the
waist down - falls towards the ground. Maybe it's just the wind, but the
legs still seem to be kicking.

The apes reel beck in horror. With mighty battle cry, the tribes-people -
the prisoners end Aregom'l followers - hurl themselves forward, attacking.

The apes break end start to run.

ON THE ROAD

Diamond end Eve have dismounted. Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming
towards her. She holds out her arms and they embrace. Neither one says a
word, they just hold each other tight.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

almost obscure the setting sun. Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge
watching the tribes-people. They've harnessed horses to ropes tied around
the statues on the avenue of idols - one after another the stone monoliths
come crashing down.

DIAMOND

If nothing else, we helped the tribes take back their valley.

WILL

Our valley, too Billia.

She looks at him - questioning.

WILL (CONT'D)

There's one thing I never told you - I never worked out how to get back.

She smiles at him.

DIAMOND

A small point. But give me some credit. I'm a scientist - I knew that.

WILL

(in wonder)

But you came anyway.

DIAMOND

That was love.

WILL

For the baby?

She shakes her head.

DIAMOND

For the both of you.

They stare into each other's eyes. They kiss.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
I only have one regret. We'll never know if we succeeded.

WILL
Of course we will. You're pregnant - if the baby's born alive, we'll know
it worked.

SUNLIGHT GLISTENS ON THE OCEAN

The surf rolls in on a golden beach. At the water's edge, a line of
footprints. We follow them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff. He's
building something out of iron and rock and sand but we can't make out what
it is.

DIAMOND (O.S.)
Will 

He turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Diamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins. Her belly is exposed,
heaw with the unborn child. Eve crouches next to her, trying to help.

WILL
It's started?

She nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts.

THE SUN IS SETTING ON THE SEA

From inside the cave, we hear Diamond scream.

IN THE CAVE

Will kneels between Diamond's legs. Her face, glistening with sweat; is a
mask of pain. She holdl Eve's hind tight and pushes.

Will, half hidden by her upraised legs, delivers the child. Diamond raises
herself up -trying to See her child. Neither she nor us can see it's face.

We push in on Will. Ha raises his hand and slaps the baby's rump. No sound.
Ha raises his hand again - suddenly the baby starts to cry. Now we see the
baby - a perfect little boy.

Eve laughs. Diamond smiles. Tears fill her eyes. She and Will look at one
another. He comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms.

THE CAVE

Will and Eve help Diamond. She comes out of the cave, still holding the
baby. It's magic hour - they stand on a rock ledge, looking at the ocean
washed with color from the setting sun.

We see what Will was building. It's sort of like a sculpture - just the
head and crown of the Statue of Liberty.

Diamond smiles. She looks at him, wondering why -

WILL
It's to make sure we never forget where we came from.

The baby starts to cry. Will puts one arm each around Diamond and Eve.

We pull back from them - high up into the stars. The baby's cry carries
over. We see earth rise. In all this nothingness - life.

RETURN OF THE APES

                                first draft

                                   1996

DEEP SPACE.

No atmosphere, no life, nothing. Just a web of lights- a billion stars hang
in a velvet void. The only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind.

The light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet. We see ragged
continents and oceans wreathed in cloud. This is earth rise. Our world
spins slowly in space, a thing of beauty, of awesome majesty. In all this
nothingness - life.

We push in on the planet - in to the Americas. The wind grows louder -

A PUEBLO VILLAGE.

A broken-down pick-up bumps into a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe
houses, blinding flurries of dust and sand. The pick-up stops in front of a
crumbling church. A man in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag. This is
the DOCTOR. '

A WOMAN'S FACE.

Screaming. She's very young - a South American Indian - lying on a bed in a
corner of one of the houses. She is in the final throes of childbirth, a
sheet draped over her loins. The Doctor works between her legs, encouraging
her in Spanish.

The local PRIEST, not long out of the seminary, crouches at her side
counting off the beads of a rosary. He looks like he is about to pass out.

SUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP. A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES
DOWN HER CHIN. THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD
-

DOCTOR

Arriva!

He lifts the child from her loins, but it makes no sound. We don't see the
baby - just the shock on the Doctor's face. The mother struggles up to see
her child.

The Doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it. He
thrusts the bundle into the Priest's hands.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

(in Spanish)

Dead - the child is dead. Now go!

We hold on the mother's anguished face. Dissolve to

A HELICOPTER

Off the roof of a tall hospital building. As it rises up into the night we
see a red cross painted on its side. It's an air ambulance.

The chopper turns away. The Manhattan skyline, every skyscraper a blaze of
lights, opens up behind it. The chopper swoops over the Brooklyn bridge and
into the night.

GROVE OF TREES

Winter's coming on - every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold. The
helicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately
tended lawn. Surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great
university. Harvard.

Two paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a
stainless steel casket onto a gurney. They wheel it fast towards one of the
buildings. As they go' through the front doors, we hold on a sign etched
into the stone

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY

A PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS

slide a long cylindrical "key" into the stainless steel casket. We pull
back to reveal the casket lies in a sealed, uncontaminated room. A group of
people in lab coats -scientists and researchers - stare through the glass
walls.

A young TECHNICIAN, working at a console, keyboards in a series of
commands.

Sswhish. The top of the steel casket swings open. Clouds of white gas
stream out -whatever's inside has been nitrogen cooled.

The gas clears. Lying inside is the body of a newborn child - except that
the baby has the skin, the face and the features of a man of eighty. The
scientists and the researchers react - shocked.

One of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby. In its fingers it
holds a long steel scalpel. This is the highest-tech autopsy you've ever
seen. The scalpel drives down, about to open the chest cavity -

BLOOD SPRAYS

But not from the baby's chest - it's in glass vials, exploding as white-hot
flames consume them. A plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted against
the flames, is emptying hospital waste into a furnace. He slams the door
shut.

He turns we see his face. He's in his 4Os, handsome in a rough-hewn way - a
strong jaw and a muscular body. There's a cool intelligence in his eyes,
but a two-day beard and a worn-out uniform make him look like a man who,
between youth and middle-age, lost his way. And so he has. His name is WILL
ROBINSON.

He takes a steel trolley, wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of
sight.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN

features the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy.
She's in her 30s - attractive, long hair left loose on her shoulders, an
air of authority about her. Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She is a
Professor of Biology.

We tilt down from the screen. It hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory
-overhead lights, rows and rows of wire animal cages. Moving down death
row, feeding the lab animals, is Will Robinson.

TWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS, CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE, TURN AND STARE
AT HIM. SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HE'S HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS
CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE TURNS AND LOOKS -

DIAMOND

The exact cause of death is still unknown. What is certain - we're dealing
with something we've never seen before. Every organ in the body is
affected...

Superimposed over Diamond's face is a three dimensional, computer-generated
graphic of the baby's body.

Will forgets about what he's doing. He walks towards the screen. We push in
on it. Screeds of new data appear

Vascular System ...............Atrophied

Neurological Function .........Senile dementia

We hold on Will's eyes - he stares at it.

AN AUDITORIUM

Billy Rae Diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing. About forty
scientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly-lit lecture hall.

Diamond is even more impressive in person - she is tall and gracious but
you don't become a Professor at Harvard' at her age without having an iron
will and a sparkling intelligence. She speaks with great authority -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

The baby in question, Michael James Flanagan -she points at the
computer-generated graphic on a huge screen

was born at New York Hospital yesterday.

MAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -

DIAMOND

But the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has received similar reports
from a village in Bolivia, two cities in Australia, seven countries in
Europe, a cluster of cases in Namibia and Mexico. Forty-two cases in all.

As she speaks, pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations.
They dot their way across the entire globe. Dr Diamond turns to face her
audience-

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Like Michael Flanagan, they were full-term babies. Two hundred and seventy
eight days since conception and yet, by all reasonable medical standards,
they have completed their entire life cycle. They have gone from conception
to death, not in three score years and ten, but in slightly less than nine
months. Michael Flanagan died of old age.

Silence as Diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it. On a
balcony high above, another man is taking notes. He sits alone, almost
hidden in shadow. It's Will Robinson.

SHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR

Will crouches in front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town.
It's night, the place is deserted. He slips a rusted key into a padlock.
Snapl The key breaks.

Will curses. He grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it. He
slides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers. The padlock
springs open.

SPIDERS

weave a web in a corner of the storage unit. A work light hangs from the
ceiling. Will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago. He puts
together a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks.

PULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT, UNSURE WHAT'S ON IT. HE TAKES A
CASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK, SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES "PLAY"A HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE. AS IT DIES, WE HEAR A MAN'S VOICE. IT'S WILL, SPEAKING
FROM YEARS AGO -

WILL

(on tape)

I would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor...

We push in on Will's face as he listens to himself...

WILL (CONT'D)

have had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues. I'm
privileged to also call them my friends -

A shadow of pain crosses his face. He shuts off the tape and sits
motionless.

LAFAYETTE PARK

Night. Homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a
coming storm. Across the road, the first drops of rain splatter against the
White House.

A string of Government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in
front of the West Portico. From inside, we hear a man's voice -
well-spoken, authoritative

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

There's no mistake - you're sure?

JEFFERSON LIBRARY

Diamond sits in the President's study - book-lined walls, a fire in the
hearth. A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of
Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is
littered with graphs end files.

DIAMOND

We've got five thousand cases now, Mr President. That's in three weeks. The
number is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours.

The President stands near a window, half in shadow, the firelight playing
across his face. He's in his 50's but the strain of office makes him look
older.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

That's a geometric progression, sir. In three months there'Il be over seven
million cases. After that we hit the wall -

She pushes a thick, bound volume across the table.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

According to this, there won't be a live birth on the planet.

The President looks at her for a moment. Then he reaches down and picks up
the bound volume. It's hundreds of pages of numbers and projections.

PRESIDENT

These are just computer projections -

species don't disappear that fast.

DIAMOND

Tell that to the dinosaurs, sir.

He looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

What date - when exactly do we hit this wall?

DIAMOND

Six months and twenty-one days.

Silence. The President keeps looking out the window.

PRESIDENT

Can't somebody tell me - what exactly are we dealing with. Is it a virus or
what?

DIAMOND

We don't know, sir.

The President turns to the Chief of Staff.

PRESIDENT

Whatever they need, Bob - anything. Harry Truman put together the Manhattan
Project - you understand?

The Chief of Staff nods his head - yes.

PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

(softly)

A world without children -it's inconceivable. And what about the rest of us
- what do we do? Just sit and watch our species die? Will the last person
to leave the planet turn out the lights.

Silence again. Finally a young woman - the White House Press Secretary -
speaks.

PRESS SECRETARY

We're going to have to manage the public. Right now, the truth may be
inoperative -

PRESIDENT

Of course we're going to have to manage itl We're going to have to manage a
whole lot of things. But can't we take at least one moment to be human?

He looks around the room. We hold on their somber faces.

A CHEAP APARTMENT

Through the window - the neon sign of a gas station. This is Will's place,
He lives alone - a bed in the corner, run-down furniture, dishes in the
sink.

The kitchen table has been turned into a desk - Will sits at an old
computer, surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks. He
stares at the screen - the notes and equations are blurred. He's been at
this so long, he can barely focus. He rubs his hand across his eyes.

A small mewing sound. Will turns to an alcove in the corner - a cat lies in
a basket, panting. Will goes to her.

She's giving birth - the first of her new-born kittens lies next to her.
Will strokes the mother's head, looking at the miracle of new life. He puts
his fingers in a water bowl, about to moisten the mother's mouth.

Then he stops. He looks again at the kitten - there's two of them now. A
beat as he just stares -

WILL

(softly)

Jesus Christ... of course!

A LUXURIOUS BATHROOM

Through frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower.
Whoever she is, she's got a great figure. The sound of a doorbell. The
shower door opens -Diamond sticks her head out. She looks at a clock - it's
almost midnight.

VIDEO ENTRY PHONE

A video screen monitors the front door. On it we see Will - his hair
tousled, an old overcoat buttoned to the neck, a battered briefcase under
his arm.

Diamond - a towel around her shoulders, hair dripping - picks up the phone.

DIAMOND

Who is it?

WILL (O.S.)

Will Robinson.

DIAMOND

I think you have the wrong house.

WILL (O.S.)

I work at the department.

He turns and looks straight into the camera. Instinctively, Diamond covers
her breasts. She looks at him - recognition dawns.

AN ELEGANT ROOM

Will and Diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse - wooden
floors and beautiful rugs. Diamond doesn't wear any make-up -just jeans and
an oversized shirt. She looks even more beautiful. It does nothing to ease
Will's nerves. He's got his briefcase open in front of him, speaking from
sheaves of notes and papers.

DIAMOND

(interrupting)

Hold on - how do you know about the case load? The Government's trying to
manage this - they've withheld that information.

WILL

The Internet, Doctor. It's a highway - you can ride it anywhere you want. I
got into 'the Center for Disease Control. I had a look at their raw data.

DIAMOND

Jesus. Do you know what you're doing? This is the White House we're talking
about.

WILL

(Heated))

No, it's a disease and it doesn't come any worse than this - that's what
we're talking about.

HE LOOKS AWAY, CALMING HIMSELF. HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES. HE SPEAKS AGAIN,
QUIETLY -

WILL

I've listened at the lab - I think I know where you're looking. Bacterias
mostly, but there's a strong push into the retro-viruses. You're wrong,
Doctor.

DIAMOND

Really - and I thought I was arrogant. But then, I'm just a professor.

WILL

No virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex.

DIAMOND

I can think of one.

WILL

Sure, it can start in pockets but it never stays there. This thing does. It
only affects women of child-bearing age. What - it's so smart it can
recognize motherhood? I don't think so. No, this is into the very heart of
what we are. This is genetic. This is part of the DNA.

DIAMOND

Thank you. A hundred thousand genes make up human DNA - that really narrows
it down.

WILL

As a matter of fact it does. There's only one part of the DNA that's passed
exclusively through women. Thirty-seven genes, the oldest part of the human
organism -

DIAMOND

(realizing)

The mitochondrial DNA.

WILL

Over the years there's been speculation -not all of it crazy either - that
somehow it triggers aging, He slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from
scientific journals across the table. She doesn't pay them any attention -
she's thinking.

DIAMOND

You realize what you're saying, don't you? A bacteria - I think we'd get it
for sure. A virus -you'd have to say we've got a chance. But say you're
right. The mitochondrial DNA - that's so far out on the frontier, we can
barely see it.

WILL

Like I said - it doesn't get any worse than this.

She keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table. A
beat.

WILL (CONT'D)

Are you okay?

DIAMOND

Sure.

WILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -

WILL

Shit. You're pregnant, aren't you?

DIAMOND

Nine weeks.

THEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS, TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT. SHE GETS TO
HER FEET -

DIAMOND

Do you want a drink - coffee, a sandwich or something?

WILL

(Recoiling)

No...no, I'm fine thanks.

Watches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered
briefcase.

AN EMPTY STREET

It's late at night. Will clutches his briefcase under his arm, heading
home. A bitter wind blows out of the north. He looks a lonely and forlorn
figure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the
streetlights.

CONVOY OF N.A.S.A. TRUCKS

RUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING. THE TRUCKS,
DOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS, TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD.
THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES. WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW
IN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -

HAND HITS A TABLE

IT'S DIAMOND - SHE'S ANGRY. BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHE'S IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS. SHE GLARES AT AN
ARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -

DIAMOND

It's just an idea, Bob. All we're doing is taking it for a walk around the
block.

A man in his 60s - distinguished, diplomatic - intercedes.

DE MAUPASSANT

There was a lot of work done on it in the 7Os. I can't recall the details
but someone had the idea that mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory.
If you could unlock it, you could physically travel back down it. Through
evolution - like a time machine.

BOB

Wowl Those 70s, man. I'm really sorry I missed them.

Everyone - Diamond included - laughs.

OLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT

They hang on the wall of a tiny room - not an office, just a
hole-in-the-wall Will has turned into his own. He sits at a table, making
notes. A knock - Diamond enters.

DIAMOND

I thought you'd like to know - we're looking at mitochondrial DNA,

WILL

Thanks for telling me.

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. IT'S AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE
WHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -

DIAMOND

Is that you?

She points at a man in his 20s standing on the deck in one of the photos,
Will nods.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Seattle. Is that where you went to school?

Will hesitates - we sense that he doesn't really want to answer.

WILL

No. Princeton.

DIAMOND

Expensive.

WILL

A scholarship. Then I did some post-graduate work... I never really
finished.

Something in the way Will says it - some sense of loss - makes Diamond
pause. She recovers and looks in her wallet. She pulls out a photograph and
hands it to Will. It shows a small sailing boatgaff-rigged and a varnished
hull.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's a Kestrel 24 - I haven't seen one of those in years. She's a beautiful
boati

DIAMOND

My grandfather left it to me. I don't sail it much any more - it's too hard
to find a for'etd hand.

WILL

What about your husband - doesn't he sail.

DIAMOND

I don't know - I haven't met him yet.

WILL LOOKS AT HER. HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT? SHE SHRUGS -

DIAMOND

I wanted a baby but I'm thirty-four-years old. Sooner or later you realize
that somewhere along the way you've missed the man you've been waiting for.

WILL

What did you do - ask a friend?

DIAMOND

I thought of it.

WILL

Lucky friend.

DIAMOND

I went to a clinic. Not exactly romantic, but it worked.

(pauses)

Good idea, bad timing.

WILL

How many people have you put on the mDNA?

DIAMOND

Seven.

WILL

That's all?!

DIAMOND

That's all I can spare. It's just a theory -one of dozens of theories.

Will looks away in disgust.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What is it with you - it's not just science is it? Why are you so
passionate about this?

WILL

I know I'm right. It's a mutation. A hundred thousand years it's probably
been lying there -shifting, weaving into the mDNA. You either go back and
change evolution or you engineer it out. Seven peopleYou might as well
shoot peas at a dam.

DIAMOND

You haven't answered my question - why so passionate?

WILL

The question's not relevant. The only thing I'm interested in is the
science.

He turns back to his work. We hear the door close as Diamond leaves.

A GEODESIC DOME

White, space-age, is being erected on the lawn. Workmen are unloading the
NASA trucks. We pull back through a high window of the Biology building. A
woman stands there, looking out. Her name is KRIS McQUADE. This is her
office -

MCQUADE

You want to tell me what's going on?

She turns and looks at Diamond, sitting on the other side of the desk,

DIAMOND

Don't ask, Kris, I'd have to lie and I don't want to do that to my best
friend,

MCQUADE

The rumor is, you've done something really big. They say the Defense
Department is taking it over.

Diamond just sits there, staring straight ahead. McQuade waits. Finally -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

Okay, okay - I'm sorry I asked. So what about this guy - what's he done?

DIAMOND

He hasn't done anything - I'm just interested.

MCQUADE

Ten thousand employment records I've got on file and you want to know about
a lab assisant?

DIAMOND

The smartest assistant I've ever known.

MCQUADE

What - he can mop and fart at the same time?

She picks up pages from a computer printer - including a copy of Will's
photo I.D.

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

He's handsome, at least I'll say -

(a thought strikes her)

Jesus - you're not interested in him like that, are you?

DIAMOND

No, but he's the most unbelievable smelling man.

MCQUADE

Smelling? You're pregnant - obviously your hormones have gone crazy. What
exactly does he smell like?

DIAMOND

You know...

(searching for the right word)

.., wholesome.

MCQUADE

Of course he does - that's the Lysol.

Diamond laughs but McQuade barely notices it. She's leafing through WiU's
file -

MCQUADE (CONT'D)

That's strange - there's supposed to be a background sheet. Family, school
-all that shit. It must have gotten lost.

Before Diamond can say anything, a young man enters. He's McQuada's
assistant.

ASSISTANT

Your secretary's on the line, Dr Diamond. There's a call for you.

DIAMOND

Tell her to take a message.

ASSISTANT

It's the New York Times.

MCQUADE

What do they want?

DIAMOND

I think Washington's news management just went south.

THE WHITE HOUSE

Night. Scores of television news vans are parked outsideDutch, Japanese and
French reporters are doing stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings of
ABC.

JENNINGS (O.S.)

We're standing by to go live to Washington as events continue to unfold on
this remarkable day. I don't think there's a person anywhere who's not
sitting by a radio or television now. I'm told the President is on his way
to the press room -

FIFTH AVENUE

is totally empty - just a young man on rollerblades. He skates effortlessly
down the deserted avenue - past Tiffany's and the Trump Tower, all silent
now.

PRESIDENT (O.S.)

My fellow Americans...

The rollerblader passes the cathedral of St John. The front doors are open.
Someone is playing the organ - Mozart's Requiem. The rollerblader fades
into the night.

STEEL DOOR OPENS

A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a
vaulted basement. All we can see are silhouettestowers of crates, racks of
equipment...

CARETAKER

This used to be the basement of the Psychology Department. We just sort of
stacked everything around 'em -

He flicks a switch - the storage room floods with light. He points at two
long iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged up to a series of
valves and pipes.

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

Flotation tanks. They used 'em for experiments in sensory degradation -

WILL

Deprivation - sensory deprivation.

CARETAKER

Yeah, well - whatever.

SHAFT OF LIGHT

WILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS. HE DROPS
INTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD, EXAMINING IT. THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM. HE
STARES AHEAD. VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -

YOUNG MAN (O.S.)

Now I know what a mole feels like -

YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.)

(lightly)

It feels like a fucking coffin, that's what it feels like.

Other voices laugh. They're all young and like the young they think they'll
never die.

CARETAKER (O.S.)

Hey, fella - what are you doing?

HE'S PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH. WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST. HE
TURNS -

WILL

Just looking. I'll be coming back - I'll need a key.

The caretaker shrugs - sure. Will climbs out of the tank.

WILL (CONT'D)

One other thing - don't tell anyone, huh?

CARETAKER

Who would I tell? They treat me like shit Worse than shit. All work, no
appreciation. The phantom of Harvard. Someone should write a fucking
musical about me.

CIRCLES OF LIGHT

Desk lamps, glowing in an office. Diamond and a team of researchers are
working through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers.

RESEARCHER

Here's another one - "Mitochondrial DNAA Map to the Past."

DIAMOND

Who's it by?

RESEARCHER

Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant.

DIAMOND

Jesus, what did this guy do - write the book on it? Who is he?

HUGE BOOK BEING OPENED

It's a scientific directory. The researcher flicks the pages and stops at
"Plant".

RESEARCHER

Wow - I thought your career was impressive.

Diamond looks up from her reading.

RESEARCHER (CONT'D)

Degrees in medicine and microbiology. A PhD at 24, a member of the Academy
of Sciences, published twenty times by 1974...

DIAMOND

And then?

RESEARCHER

Then nothing.

DIAMOND REACTS. SHE GETS TO HER FEET, COMING CLOSER -

DIAMOND

Where did he go as an undergraduate?

RESEARCHER

Princeton.

DIAMOND

On a scholarship?

A CORRIDOR

It's late at night. The scientists and their staff are working around the
clock. Will wheels a trolley laden with bottles, vials, and catheters down
a crowded corridor. Diamond pushes through the people behind, trying to
catch up to him. Scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Robert!

Will keeps walking, heading for an elevator. Diamond skirts around a knot
of people.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Doctor Plant!

Will hesitates - one split second - then keeps going. The elevator doors
slide open. Will steps in, turns and hits a button. He watches Diamond
pushing towards him. For a moment their eyes meet. She comes closer.
Sswhish! The doors slide shut.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

She sits behind her desk, listening to the chief of campus security.

SECURITY OFFICER

The equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs. It includes a
range of genetic material-

(hands her an inventory)

We've checked all the buildings your team is using - he's not in any of
them.

DIAMOND

What about hie house?

SECURITY OFFICER

He asked his landlady to look after his cat. She hasn't seen him for three
days.

IN THE BASEMENT

there's a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to
it is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials.

Will is sit'ting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and
equations reel across them. The caretaker comes out of the shadows,
carrying two mugs of thick coffee. He puts one down next to Will -

CARETAKER

You wanna tell me what exactly you're doing?

WILL

Looking for a date.

The caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the
screen -

CARETAKER

What's wrong with a calendar?

WILL

These are chemical sequences - they represent human genes. By following a
trail of mutations, I can date them. I'm trying to find out when a major
change occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA.

CARETAKER

The mitochondrial DNA? Yeah... well that makes sense.

But Will barely hears it. Suddenly he's leaning forward, keyboarding in
complex commands. The caretaker watches him -

CARETAKER (CONT'D)

You've found it?

WILL

Maybe...

He has illustrations of two long-chain molecules on the screen. He moves
them together. Aa they overlap, we see they're not identical - the tail of
one kicks upwarda. Will starel at it -

WILL (CONT'D)

(softly)

Yeah - I've found it.

CARETAKER

So - what's the date?

Will presses a key. Faster than the eye can follow, the first long-chain
molecule starts to shift and mutate. Finally it resolves itself into the
second molecule. Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -

WILL

The best computer science can do? One hundred and two thousand years ago.

CARETAKER

Sort of what I figured - give or take a day or two.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a
page -there's a photo of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three
colleagues. He's got his arm around one of them - an attractive young
woman.

Diamond lifts the photo, looking at it more closely. She starts to read the
caption. We push in on it and hold on the words... "UC Berkeley".

WE ARE FLYING

swooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs,
tumbling streams and primordial forest. There's something unreal about it -
we pull back to reveal they're computer-generated images, playing on the
screens in the basement.

The caretaker has pulled up a chair. He and Will are watching the images
generated by a CD-ROM.

WILL

This is someone's version of the prehistoric world. I'm interested in the
geography, the atmosphere -that sort of stuff.

CARETAKER

Where are we?

WILL

Africa - that's where Mankind started.

Will keeps looking at the strange images. The caretaker gets to his feet -

CARETAKER

I'll see you in the morning.

WILL

Yeah.

The caretaker limps towards the door. Will looks up -

WILL (CONT'D)

Thank you - for helping me, I mean.

CARETAKER

It sounds like you're leaving or something.

WILL

No. I just wanted to say it, that's all.

The caretaker keeps looking at him -

CARETAKER

What exactly are you doing? You're a bit old to try and make your mark,
aren't you? Anyway, nobody listens to people like us.

WILL

Fate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a second chance. Do you know what
it's like to be ridiculed, to have your ideas thrown back in your face? And
that was the easy part. I guess that's what I'm doing - I want to prove
that I was right.

CARETAKER

You're lying to me.

WILL

What do you mean?!

CARETAKER

You are going somewhere. I don't know where it is. I'm not even sure I can
imagine it. Good luck, though. I hope you find whatever it is you're
looking for.

WILL

Thanks.

CARETAKER

No point in getting you breakfast, huh?

Will shakes his head - no. They smile at each other. The caretaker turns
and goes.

DIAMOND'S OFFICE

Diamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk. Her
Secretary stands in the doorway -

SECRETARY

I've got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone. She runs the archives at Berkeley.

DIAMOND

(into phone)

Ms Wilkins?

We push in tight on Diamond's face as she listens. Anxiety and alarm
register on it.

OUTER OFFICE

The security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the
campus. Researchers and scientists have gathered in the office, rumors are
flying. Everyone turns - Diamond stands in the doorway to her office. She
looks at deMaupassant.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You were right, Luc. That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the
one that did it. He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail.
Within every one of us is the history of our race. It's imprinted on our
genes - like a map. Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back
down it. Through the womb. Through time and space -

(she looks at them all)

That's what he's doing. He's going back. He's going to try and change
evolution.

SECURITY OFFICER

Is that possible?

DIAMOND

He was the best of his generation. He thinks so. He's got the genetic
material for the key. All he needs are flotation tanks.

THE FLOTATION TANKS

The valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks.

Will sits next to the rack of medical equipment, beads of sweat on his
forehead. He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter. He
opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials. A cocktail of fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm. The
fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it.

A LONG CORRIDOR

Diamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs.
Ahead -a pair of swing doors -

BOB

A theory's one thing - do you really think he'll try it?

DIAMOND

He's spent fifteen years as a lab assistant. He lives in a two room walk-up
with a cat. No family, no friends. What's There's left for him here? Of
course he'll do it.

Smack! They push through the doors, into another corridor.

AN IRON LADDER

Will climbs up the side of the flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a
tremor, a rippling wave, passes from his feet to his head. It's his muscles
contracting. It wracks him with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.

Smash! The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get
in. Will looks up - the door twists and moves. His vision is starting to
distort. He grabs the access hatch and swings through -

Splashl He drops into the water. Clang! He closes the hatch.

Barn? The steel door flies open. The security officer lowers a sledge
hammer. Diamond steps in end throws a light switch.

DARKNESS IN THE TANK

Will floats on his back, the only sound is the rapid thump of his
heartbeat. The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into
spasms. We push along his body - up to his face. His eyes roll back into
his headl

All we see are the whites of them. They shatter into a web of capillaries -

WILL'S POV

red mist swirls in front of him. It resolves itself into a web of
interwoven tendrils -the double helix of the DNA molecule. Will starts to
travel through it -

INSIDE THE TANK

Will is morphing, shedding cells - we're losing him in the warm, dark fluid
of the tank. It's like the womb. His body seems to be disintegrating,
dissolving into it. Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once
were.

His hollow mouth opens. From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream.

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Not a sound escapes. The security officer is about to try and open the
hatch.

DIAMOND (O.S.)

NO!

The security officer turns - Diamond is holding the catheter in her hand.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

If we open the hatch, I think we'll kill him. It's too late - it's his
journey, he's going to have to take it.

INSIDE THE TANK

Will's body is like a shadow, almost one with the water, growing less
distinct by the moment. What is left of his face - a strange, shifting
shape - floats towards us. Closer... closer. It melts completely into the
water -

WILL'S POV

He spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it
shatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling
through the heavens. A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling
through space and time -

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Diamond and the others are gathered around the computers. Bob is working
the keyboard. Diamond is looking.through the piles of papers, notes and
star charts.

DIAMOND

Everything's here - he kept a record of every step. He can even tell the
date -forty hours after he arrives there's a solar eclipse.

BOB

Billie - there's a note for you.

Diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen. She reads what is
writ'ten -

DIAMOND

"I won't be here, but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them,
Billie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley."

THE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT

blaze through the heavens. They draw together, changing and reconstituting
into a shape we recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules. The
strands connect. A blast of light! It's the rays of -

THE SUN

streaming into a cave. Will lies in the fetal position, bleeding from his
nose and ears. The light grows stronger - it's dawn. Will drags himself up
and stumbles towards the entrance. We tilt up from him. He doesn't see it,
but we do - prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock.

A CRAGGY PEAK

Will steps out of the cave. Sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new -
plains and jungle and primordial forest. Rising above it is a snow-capped
mountain that looks like Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs across the earth -
a rift valley. Will stares at it. He raises his face to the sun. He did it.
The first step's over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the
valley is a tiny pillar of smoke.

A FOREST CLEARING

In the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp-fire. Will moves
cautiously towards it. He stops - several bodies, terribly mangled, lie on
the ground.

Will turns one of them over - he's got matted hair, a heavy brow and a
short, muscular body. As primitive as he is, there's no doubt of his
species. He is a man. A Paleolithic man.

This was a hunting party -scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of
dead animals lie nearby. For a moment Will thinks the hunters must have
been torn apart by wild animals. Then he looks up into the trees - more
bodies of the hunters. But no animal did this - they hang from iron chains,
left there as some sort of trophy. Or a warning.

CRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS

Will is following a tiny trail through the forest. He's taken what is
useful from the bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag, two
short-handled spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt. He moves on -
deeper into the shadows of the forest.

A SPARKLING STREAM

Will splashes through the crystal water. He looks upstream - a small lake.
A flock of strange birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of
pink and gold.

He steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of
over-arching trees. We hold on his feet - whip! He triggers something. A
net of woven vines engulfs him. He drops the spears and bedroll. Suddenly
he's soaring through the air.

He jerks to a halt - he's a netted animal hanging high in the trees. The
faces of two Paleolithic men, crouched on boughs, stare at him.

PLUME OF WATER

cascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge. Smoke curls up from fires.
Scores of stone-age people - man, women and children - turn and look. Will,
roped and bound, is being hauled into the encampment.

The primitive people - nervous but intrigued - circle around him. They are
dressed in skins and fur. talismans hang from their necks. The warriors
carry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads. It makes
them look even more savage.

Will is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit. A
pile of ivory tusks lie nearby. The two captors jerk on the leash - it
stops Will in front of a cave. Hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and
head of their totema saber-toothed tiger. This is the Tribe of the Tiger.

A man emerges from under its outstretched paws. He's in his late 20's -
proud and strong. His name is Kip-Kena - he is their leader. He and Will
look at one another.

Kip uses his hands to sign to Will in the formal language of his race. Will
stares at him - he has no idea what it means. He shrugs. Kip tries a new
tack - he speaks. The sounds are rough and guttural - but understandable,
KiP Where is your tribe?

Will pauses, searching for an answer- where do you start? He gives up.

WILL

I don't have a tribe.

A rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe.

KIP

No man can live without a tribe! How would he hunt the mighty animals? Who
would keep his fire burning?

WILL

I come from far away... I'm a traveler.

KIP

What is traveler? Is that a tribe?

Again Will's at a loss. Something catches Kip's eye. He reaches forward and
rips the water bag out from under Will's coat. The tribe reacts -

KIP (CONT'D)

You carry things taken from our hunters! Kill him.

He turns away. Will throws himself at him -

WILL

NO!

Whackl A blow to the back of Will's neck knocks him to his knees. He looks
up -two warriors have their spears raised, about to plunge them into his
chest.

A sound like thunder - it's hooves. The warriors turn. Will follows their
gaze - half an army, mounted on horseback, surges into the gorge, They are
heavily armed, dressed in armor but it's not their weaponry that astonishes
Will. These are apes!

The tribes-people scream in terror. They turn and run. The two warriors
forget about Will. He dives for cover in a pile of rocks. As he tears
himself free of the ropes that bind him, he looks out -

The apes charge in to the camp. At their head is a huge gorillarippling
muscles and intelligent eyes - deep set and yellow, like pissholes in the
snow. He wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver. His name is Drak. He
is the Lord of the High Rivers, supreme commander of the ape army. On
either side ride his elite Praetorian Guard.

Woo-woo-woo! Kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head. It's a
bull-roarer. The warriors of the tribe know its meaning - they rally to
Kip's side. Armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between
the apes and their panic-driven people, trying to buy them time to get into
the cave.

Sswhish! The sound of arrows. The apes carry triple-barreled iron
crossbows.

Short iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down. Dust and smoke swirls
across the camp. Kip and his men, fighting all the way, retreat towards the
cave.

A baby's cry! Will turns - a toddler sits at a hearth, left behind in the
confusion. Will half rises to his feet, about to go for him. Too late -
there's a blur of movement irt the trees. A tribe-boy - too young to be a
warrior - has come back for the child.

Out of the dust and smoke - Drak! Foam flies from his horse's mouth. He's
seen the boy and the child. He locks what looks like a Gatling gun tight
under his huge bicep.

Will screams a warning. The boy turns - he sees Drak as he fires. A hail of
iron darts - twenty or more - cut him and the child down.

Rage flashes in Will's eyes. He scrambles over a boulder and rips a
crossbow from a dead ape's hand. He slides bolts into the barrels and grabs
a lever with both hands -you need the strength of an ape to cock it. A
sound behind him - little more than a whisper. He swings -It's an arrow.
Whackl It rips into his shoulder, hurling him to the ground. Ape infantry -
foot soldiers - are coming into the gorge behind him.

In their midst are three huge steam-driven machines - like iron erector
sets. One is the Claw, one is the Balls and the other is the Flame.

THE CAVE ENTRANCE

Kip and his warriors have seen them too. They scramble into the cave. Men
and women are inside, swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from
tree trunks.

Other warriors, caught outside, run for the closing gap. On their heels is
Will - still clutching the crossbow, blood streaming from his wound. The
doors are closing... closing. Will dives through the gap, almost crushed -

INSIDE THE CAVE

Slam! The doors fly shut. Wham! A huge cross-beam drops into place. Will,
sprawled in the dust, looks up - chaos. By torchlight, the medicine man is
tending the wounded, children are screaming, women and old people are
clambering up a series of ledges. High above is a tiny slash of
daylightanother entrance.

From deep in the cave Will hears the roar of some animal but he doesn't
have time to think about it. Smash! The great wooden doors shudder from
some mighty blow.

OUTSIDE THE DOORS

The three machines are in place. The first of them has two huge stone balls
suspended by chains from an overhead jib. An ape sits right on top,
operating it. The balls dance and swing wildly - smash! They hit the door,
opening a hole.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Daylight streams in. Kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high
around the walls, ready to attack when the apes pour in. A pair of huge
iron jaws appear in the hole. This is the second of the apes' machines -
the Claw.

Another roar from the animal. Will watches the Claw reach in and grab the
massive crossbeam. It snaps it like a twig. Will gets to his feet and runs.
He sees Kip signal -

AN OLD WARRIOR

is perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the
cave, turning it into a cage. He opens it.

Crash! The stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open. The first of
the ape cavalry charges in. A roar from the unseen animal. The apes' horses
catch the scent of it. They whinny in terror.

Will stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage. The
tribe's totem is a living thing - the saber-toothed tiger ia three times
the size of its Bengal cousin, a head the size of an ox and two ten-inch
teeth curved down either side of its jaw.

The horses are bucking and rearing. The tiger leaps towards the door,
heading for freedom. A dismounted ape raises his weapon. The tiger doesn't
even break stride. One lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and
flesh of the ape's chest.

Will can smell the animal's breath as it flies past. An ape officer, still
on his horse, turns - another swipe from the.tiger's paw rips out his
throat.

Kip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry -
half of them dismounted, all of them in disarray. The tiger runs soars
through the doorway -

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Drak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into
the forest.

ON THE LEDGES

Kip's men are fighting as they retreat, heading towards the opening at the
roof of the cave. Will, clutching his wounded shoulder, makes his own way
up the wall.

Beneath him, Drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines - a long
iron tube in a rolling superstructure. Feeding it are a series of
oil-filled bladders. One of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole. A
tongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube. It's a flame thrower -The
fiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave. The flame engulfs two
warriors. Skin blazing, they plummet to the ground.

The flame thrower fires again - scorching the rock wall, filling the cave
wit a pall of smoke. It hits the tiny patch of daylight, cutting off
escape.

Will - trapped - runs along a ledge, over a pile of rocks and jumps. Into
mid-air! He lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels
into its flanks.

The apes and the surviving warriors turn. For a moment they just stare -
nobody's ever seen a human ride a horse before. Will flies towards the
entrance. He sees Kip on a ledge just above, battling three huge apes.

WILL

Jump!

Kip sees Will galloping towards him. One of the apes raises a double-bladed
sword. Kip jumps sprawling across the horse's neck, grabbing on to its
flowing mane.

Drak stares at Will - he's never seen anything like him. He wheels his
horse around and spurs it forward in pursuit.

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Will's horse bursts out of the cave - past the Claw and under the Balls.
The apes turn and look - astonished. They scramble for their horses. Drak
charges through.

Will hurtles towards the trees. Kip, hanging on for life, looks behind -
Drak raises his Gatling gun and aims. Kip wrenches Will's head down - zing!
The arrows skim past.

Drak can't outpace them - and he can't re-load at the gallop either. They
charge out of the camp, into -

THE DAPPLED LIGHT OF THE FOREST

Drak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge
ape stands on the back of the charging horse!

He jumps - his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough. He swings
himself up into the tree - he is an ape, after all. He throws himself from
branch to bough, traveling at incredible speed.

Will glances back - he sees Drak's riderless horse. His eyes dart in
confusion -where is he? We crane up - he's in the trees above! Drak jumps -

Wham! Hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into Will's shoulder, lifting him
out of the saddle and hurling him to the ground.

Kip hauls down on the horse's bridle - wheeling the stallion around.

Will looks up from the dust - Drak towers above him. Will sees Kip coming
back -

WILL (CONT'D)

Run!

A volley of arrows whiz past Kip - other apes are galloping through the
trees. Kip grabs the bridle and kicks - the horse spins and gallops away.

massive, armor-clad paw grabs Will's head. He looks straight into Drak's
face. The ape reaches out and rips a claw down Will's cheek. Will tries to
stifle the scream. Drak touches the wound and tastes the blood -

DRAK

So - it's human, after ell.

He spits the blood out in revulsion. Will stares into the piu-holes in his
face. Never has he seen eyes so cold.

Will tries to rise to hie feet. His wounded shoulder has weakened him - he
staggers. Drak's clenched fist, clad in chain mail, drives straight et
Will's jaw. Smashl Fade to black.

THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN

It's Will's point of view - he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart.
He's very weak, his shirt drenched in blood. He rolls over and the image
rights itself.

He drags himself on to all fours but he can't get any further - his legs
are chained.

WILL

(fevered, disoriented)

Where the fuck am I?

Will looks up - a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon.

GUARD

(smiling)

The end of the road.

Will - confused, panicky - grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to
his knees. He looks past an escort of ape cavalry - they are traveling down
an avenue of idols -towering statues of apes, sculpted out of stone, old as
ages past. Fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red,
flickering glow.

Will turns away. Behind him he sees humans, rows of them - dead - hanging
upsidl down from long poles like trophies.

Everything comes flooding back - he slumps against the side of the cart,
eyes barely focused. Blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool
between his legs. He doesn't even notice it.

MASSIVE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

spans a roaring river. Drak and his convoy clatter across it. We crane up -
laid out before is a city. Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged
ravine. Opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of
stone.

Apes are everywhere - hammering stones to enlarge a house, chattering in
the trees, swinging hand-over-hand along horizontal ladders - crossing from
one side of the ravine to the other.

Will has roused himself. He stares at the city through feverish eyes - to
him, it appears to float. Buildings swim in and out of focus. His shoulders
shake - he starts to laugh, an edge of hysteria to it.

WILL

A city... of course. Ape city! I've destroyed my mind. Or maybe I'm dead
and this is God's last joke - hell is ruled by apes.

Whhish - the end of a whip sails through the air. Crack! It hits Will's
back, doubling him over.

GUARD

Quiet, animal!

RIPPLES OF WATER

run across the surface of a beautiful pool. A black shape glides along
underwater. The head breaks the surface - it's an old gorilla, the fur on
his face gray and balding. This is NAZGUL. He is the Ghan - the President -
of the Council of Elders.

He walks out of the water. Other old apes - all male, their days of warring
and building over - lie around the pool. Several of them, draped only in
rough loin-cloths, groom each other, picking nits out of their fur.

The sound of a gong! Nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the
pool. He looks straight down the ravine - at the far end, Drak and his
troop come into view.

NAZGUL

The raiders are home.

OLD APE

(lazily)

Good hunting?

Nazgul squints against the sun. He sees the poles carrying the dead humans.

NAZGUL

By the look of it.

GRAY-BEARDED WARRIOR, HIS CHEST MARKED BY THE SCARS OF MANY BATTLES, GETS
UP -

GRAY BEARD

(proudly)

Not as good as when we rode the high ridges, I'll warrant.

NAZGUL

Times are different now. Back then, a could go out and come back with a
brace of animals. They're far scarcer now -

OLD APE

Not scarce enough, I say.

There's a murmur of agreement from the other apes.

A TINY BOAT

is wreathed in woven leaves. Lying in it is the dead body of a young ape.
The boat drifts down an underground stream. All around it rise the stone
walls of a huge cavern. Torches light up the gloom - this place is a
temple.

A group of apes - mourners - walk along a path, keeping pace with the
funeral boat.

They make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats - a dirge for
the dead.

At the head of the procession, swinging a smoking censer, is an ape wearing
a lion-skin cloak. His face is scarred and twisted - he has one cruel eye,
the other is just an empty socket. Beneath the cloak, one arm and a leg are
withered. The whole effect, rather than diminishing his power, enhances it.
His name is MA-GOG. He is high priest of the apes, defender of the faith,
keeper of the Book of the Lore.

The funeral boat gathers speed in the current. It thrusts towards sunlight
pouring through an arch.

A ROCK PLATFORM

The mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock. We pull back
to reveal where they stand - a huge crouching ape has been carved out of
the face of a cliff, Its bowed front legs form the archway, the entrance to
the temple of the ape.

CLOUDS OF MIST AND WIND-BLOWN SPRAY SWEEP OVER MA-GOG AND THE MOURNERS. ALL
AROUND THEM, THE SOUND OF ROARING WATER. THE FUNERAL BOAT FLOATS OUT OF THE
TEMPLE AND INTO A ROARING RIVER. MA-GOG SWINGS THE CENSER OVER THE WATER -

MA -GOG

(intoning)

In the beginning was the word, and the word was the Book of the Lore. It
says God created the ape in His own image. Alone among His creatures, the
ape has a soul. One crosses the river now but death is only a door. He will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen The mourners beat their chests
with their fists. They repeat the word "Amen".

For a moment the clouds of mist clear. Now we see where the boat is headed
- half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop. These are the Falls of No
Return. The boat races forward - over the waterfall it goes.

The sound of cheering voices, very faint, drifts towards them. Ma-Gog turns
and looks up the river towards the city -

APES HANG FROM THE 'LADDERS'

looking down on Drak and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut
into the side of the ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings
to greet them.

Will lies in the back of the cart, unconscious. Faces of apes stare in at
him - they've never seen anything like it. A young ape - a little boy -
stands with his grandfather.

KID

What is it?

GRANDFATHER

Some... sort of human.

KID

But look at the eyes, 'Pa - they're the color of the sea. Where's it from?

GRANDFATHER

I don't know - a traveler, maybe. Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower
of the Moon.

THE WORD "TRAVELER" IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES. IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE
CROWD. A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -

WOMAN

No it's not - it's a mutant.

LABORER

Put it in the zoo!

A female ape pushes them aside. She's heavy-set, bright eyes, an air of
authority about her. Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a
series of steel instruments dangling from it. Her name is ZORA - she is a
doctor.

She and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart.
Kneeling beside him, Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Will's
crotch.

ZORA

Whatever it is, it's male.

She rips open Will's shirt - his chest is covered in blood from the gaping
wound.

ZORA (CONT'D)

Probe.

The Assistant hands her a steel instrument. She slides it towards the
wound. We hold on Will's face - a strangled cry but he doesn't regain
consciousness. Zore returns the bloodied probe to her Assistant. She calls
out -

ZORA (CONT'D)

Drak!

The leader of the ape warriors, riding close by, turns -

ZORA (CONT'D)

The animal's bleeding to death, my Lord.

Drak rides up to the wagon.

DRAK

I didn't bring him all this way just to have him die.

ZORA

(to the assistant)

Ben-Guri - get a vet. Quicklyl

AN APE IN A LEATHER APRON

uses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife. This is the VET.
Will lies on a stone slab nearby - it's a sort of medical centersinks along
the walls, racks of equipment, hoses to wash down the blood.

The Vet cuts the clothing away from Will's wound. He turns to Doctor Zora -

VET

We're going to have to give him blood.

PRISONER IN A CELL

He's a tribesman - in his late 40s. Despite his tattered furs and hollow
cheeks, he carries himself with dignity - he's a proud man. His name is
ARAGORN. On a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament, like
crescent moon. Etched into it are strange markings and the totems of
various tribes.

The sound of a key in lock. Aragorn turns - the cell door is thrown back.
Three ape guards enter. Two of them, armed with spears, drive Aragorn into
a corner. The third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole. He drops
it over Aragorn's head.

Aragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight. They drag him from
the cell.

TEAM OF HORSES

- their flanks drenched in sweat - walk in a circle. They turn a huge wheel
that controls a series of pulleys and winches. Attached to the end of a
heavy cable is a wooden platform - a primitive elevator. It runs from a
series of impressive house, down the side of the ravine, to the center of
the city.

Standing on the platform are Nazgul and several other elders. They look
down on the central square. It's crowded with apes - soldiers are being
greeted by their kin.

ARAGORN LIES ON HIS BACK

He's strapped to a slab, half-naked, in the medical center. They've put a
gag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself, he can barely
move.

Will, still unconscious, lies on a table next to him. Nazgul peers down at
him.

NAZGUL

It's human, you say?

Doctor Zora nods - yes.

NAZGUL

It's even uglier than the others.

He pulls a covering aside and looks at Will's naked legs.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

How can he hunt with legs like those -they're like twigs. Maybe he's
diseased.

Everybody shrugs - who knows?

The Vet heats a steel needle over an open flame. The other end of the
needle is attached to a length of animal intestine. It acts as a tube. The
Vet grabs Will's forearm and slides the red-hot needle into the vein.
Will's body jerks with the pain. Nazgul and the others spring back.

For a moment Will's wrenched back to consciousness - he sees a light-filled
room, a bandage on his chest, a bladder full of blood hanging above him.
His puts it together the only way he knows - he thinks he's in hospital

WILL

(groggy)

Help me. I've got health insurance. Honest...

His eyes close as he slips back into darkness. Nazgul looks at Doctor Zora.

NAZGUL

What is health insurance?

DOCTOR ZORA

Some sort of religion...?

The Vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder. Another length of
tubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to Aragorn's arm. It's
his blood. Now we realize - this is the ape version of a blood transfusion.

NAZGUL

Do you think this'Il work?

VET

You can never tell with animals. Their bodies aren't as sophisticated as an
ape's. Sometimes their blood fights with each other. Either way, you know
really quick -they get up and walk around, or they're dead.

The Vet turns a little tap - Aragorn's blood flows down the tube. It hits
Will's vein.

WORDS CHISELED INTO STONE

"An Ape without knowledge is a fire without light."

Euripadape III

It stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge. This is the Hall
of Learning. Ma-Gog - his lion skin cloak billowing behind him - hurries up
the steps.

THE BLADDER OF BLOOD

is empty. Guards are collaring Aragorn, preparing to drag him out. The door
into the room is thrown open. Ma-Gog enters. Nazgul and the others greet
him but he barely acknowledges it *

MA-GOG

Show him to me.

The Vet grabs Will's hair. He lifts up his head so that Ma-Gog can see his
face.

The high priest takes a step back - there's something about Will that fills
him with loathing. Anger flashes in his one good eye. He stares at Will.
His voice is Iow, almost to himself -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

All my life I've dreaded this day.

(turns to the others)

Kill him.

DOCTOR ZORA

We've just spent an hour trying to save him -

MA-GOG

Kill him!

He grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground. Doctor
Zora takes his arm, stopping him -

DOCTOR ZORA

The animal's unique, my lord. At least we should look at his brain. Maybe
it's possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him. Imagine - a
tame human!

MA-GOG

Man can't be tamed. Alone among God's primates he kills for lust or greed.
He will murder his own brother to possess his brother's land.

NAZGUL

The doctor's only asking for a chance to experiment. The benefits would be
enormous. A tame species of human could double food production, at last we
could dam the rivers.

MA-GOG

You don't know what you're dealing with.

NAZGUL

It's just an animal, Ma-Gog.

MA-GOG

It's not. That's the trouble.

A movement on the stone slab. They turn and look - Will's eyelids are
fluttering. He's starting to come round. itl

He turns to Nazgul In the name of God - summon the Council of Elders.

Will's eyes are open now. Like through a glass - darkly - he sees the ape
guards coming for him. He tries to struggle but he's very weak. They haul
him off.

HEAVY IRON DOOR

set in a rock wall - on one side a key-hole. We tilt up the door to a
narrow set of bars high above it. A face, straining with effort, rises up
to peer through the bars. It is Will - looking like death but forcing
himself to do it, desperate to see where he is.

INSIDE THE CELL

The muscles across his shoulders ripple. His one good hand clutches the
bars. He hangs by it, supporting his weight, staring out at a vaulted
underground cavern. It looks like a cattle-yard, broken down and disused
nowa series of long pens, wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt.

Will can't support himself any longer - he tumbles to the ground. He crawls
across the floor and examines the door. It fits tight to the rock. There's
no hope of picking the lock - the key-hole doesn't even come all the way
through.

Suddenly he stops. Nothing for a moment, then he hears it again - a
scraping sound.

He peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall. One of
the blocks moves. Will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell. Aragorn
squeezes through from the adjoining cell. He looks at Will -

ARAGORN

So you lived, then?

WILL

What did they do?

ARAGORN

They gave you blood.

He holds up his bandaged forearm - Will realizes where it came from.

WILL

I hope you had a medical.

Aragorn looks at him - confused. From a distance, the sound of horses
whinnying.

WILL (CONT'D)

What is this place?

ARAGORN

It was a slaughterhouse.

WILL

For horses?

ARAGORN

They use it for stables now. No - s different kind of animal. For humans.

Will stares, taken aback. Aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners
of the cell.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

In my father's time, the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here.
Young apes killed some during their manhood rites, the others were made
sport of in the corrals. At the end, the bodies were thrown onto the belts
and fed to the fire.

Aragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves. From out of his cloak, he
takes two pieces of flint and strikes them. A spark starts the fire -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

(softly)

Death is stuck to these walls, stranger -sounds not even s thousand winters
can take away. Sometimes of s night they speak to me - I can hear the
screams of my people.

Will looks at him. Firelight plays across their faces.

WILL

Why haven't they killed you?

ARAGORN

They keep me ss bait. My name is Aragorn -

He lifts his hand to Will - palm outwards. It's some form of greeting. Will
returns it.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

I am the Ranger of the Easterlings, the Leader of the Seven Tribes. They
hope the warriors will come and try to free me.

WILL

And will they?

ARAGORN

Not if they fear my anger. I was taken in summer and now winter's almost
gone. Even the apes grow tired - soon they'll make me walk the Paths of the
Dead.

Will looks at Aragorn's eyes - they're fearless. The ornament glints on his
chest. Will points at it -

WILL

what is it?

ARAGORN

It's called the Crescent of Light - it's the talisman of my rank.

WILL

Silver.

ARAGORN

Mithral is how we name it..

Will reaches his hand towards it -

WILL

Can I borrow it?

Aragorn recoils - this is the most precious thing in the world to him. His
hand closes around the insignia -

ARAGORN

Who are you? What brings you to the valley of the tribes?

WILL

I meant you no harm. I'm looking for woman, one of my own kind. Do you know
of people like me?

ARAGORN

Never.

Will nods his head, accepting it. Slowly he reaches his hand out -

WILL

If you want to get out of hare. I need the talisman. Aragorn.

The two men look at each other. A beat - then Aragorn reaches up and
unfastens it.

THE TEMPLE OF THE APE

Torches burn on the walls. They cast a glow across the temple - the
underground stream, pools of water, shelves of rock hewn out of the walls.
Several apes crouch on them, praying to a golden idol of an ape.

Mist rises off of the pools. Moving through it, we see Nazgul, Drak and e
group of old apes. The Council of Elders is gathering. They pass through a
narrow door -

THE TEMPLE'S INNER CHAMBER

Oil lamps - hidden in alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog. He stands in front of an
ancient book - strange symbols, like Sanskrit, run across its pages. This
is the Book of the Lore.

Ma-Gog looks at the Council of Elders seated in front of himNazgul, Drak
and five other huge apes - all leaders in their time.

MA-GOG

How many scrolls are there in the Book of the Lore?

Nobody replies - the question is so obvious it needs no answer.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

One-hundred-and-seventy-six, you say -every child knows that.

(softly)

But every child is wrong. There is one more scroll - the last scroll,
sealed with seven seals, handed down from high priest to high priest...

He slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden
catch. The top - the Book still resting on it - tilts up, revealing a
secret compartment. It is lined with gold leaf. Lying in it is a slim folio
of pages -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

It is called the Scroll of Revelation.

The Council of Elders stare in awed silence. Ma-Gog takes the pages out and
unfastens the seals. He reads -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"And it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages. A silence fell and I
saw a new heaven and a new earth. Like through a glass, darkly, I saw the
future."

The Council of Elders stare at him. He limps forward and stops in front of
them. He recites from memory -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

"Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the
horse is Death. Those that ride on him are beasts, but like no beasts born
before. Their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea. They
are given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and
with fire. And let him that hath understanding know the number of these
beasts. It is the number of Man."

He raises his eyes and looks straight at the Councilors.

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Today we saw that beast. Mark those words, my Lords - "their limbs are weak
but they are given power over the earth". Now will you listen? Kill him!
And if we don't? Then all hope will fail in this bitter winter.

He lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment. Nazgul
looks from one to the other of the elders. Nobody says a word but he can
read their grim expressions. He turns to Drek -

NAZGUL

Kill him. Kill him with the sword and with fire. Kill himl

THE KEYHOLE TO THE CELL

It's a shining bright image, slightly distorted. We pull back to reveal
it's a reflection. Aragorn's silver ornament has been polished to a
brilliant luster. It's fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking
through the bars high above the iron door.

INSIDE THE CELL

The wooden bed has been smashed to pieces.

Both Aragorn and Will have used parts of their clothing to harness
themselves so they can see through the bars. Aragorn controls the pole with
the "mirror" on the end of it.

By looking into it, Will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door.
He has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it. He turns the pole,
guiding the nail towards the keyhole. He's trying to pick the lock.

WILL

Do you understand time.., what time is it?

Aragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse -

ARAGORN

Seven hours since the rising of the sun.

WILL

Just after noon...

ARAGORN

Shouldn't we wait until night?

WILL

(concentrating)

If I'm right, it's gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think.

The nail is almost in the key-hole. Half an inch to go... a quarter. It
slides off. Will curses and starts again -

THE SUN

beats down from a cloudleu sky. Drak and two huge Praetorian Guards - Max
and Hannibal - come through a huge stone portico. It's another entrance to
the Temple -one that opertl onto a central square. Orak and the two guards
hurry across it. towards the slaughterhouu.

THE NAIL

at the end of the pole slides into the keyhole. Will - barely breathing in
case it breaks his concentration - listens carefully. He moves the end of
the pole. The nail turns.

HUGE SET OF DOORS

are thrown open. Daylight spills into the slaughterhouse. Drak, Max and
Hannibal enter. Drak stops - he listens to the horses whinnying and
stomping their hooves -

DRAK

Something's wrong!

(turns to Max)

Get the dogs.

HANNIBAL

moves cautiously along the side one of the corrals, trying to see what's
wrong with the horses. Behind him - a movement in the shadows.

Sswhish. The sound of something slicing through the air. He turns -

It's the side of Aragorn's hand. It chops hard into the ape's throat,
shattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness. He crumples to
the ground.

Aragorn and Will strip him of his weapons. Will starts to go but Aragorn
tears a strip off both their shirts. He ties the fabric around the ape's
ankles.

WILL

What are you doing?

ARAGORN

Watch - they're going to bring in the dogs.

THE DOGS

aren't really dogs at all - they're a much earlier ancestor. We call them
wolves. There are two of them, on the end of heavy leather leashes. Their
handlers have them in Will's cell, rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses
in front of their noses. The wolves take the scent.

Drak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes. The wolves leap out of
the cell.

HANNIBAL

rises groggily to his feet, clutching his injured throat. He takes a few
steps forward -Grrrr! He turns - the two wolves fly towards him. He tries
to yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak.

He runs - the fabric, unseen by him, trails from his ankles. The wolves
pound after him. He glances over his shoulder. First one wolf - then the
other - leaps.

Fangs and claws glistening, they hit him in the back, hurling him to the
ground. He writhes on to his back. One wolf tears at his ankles, the other
goes for his throat. Rip! Blood sprays as the artery breaks.

A STONE PASSAGE-WAY

Will and Aragorn are running, plunging down in to darkness. Arches and
corridors open off of it. It's like a labyrinth -

WILL

This doesn't seem like the way out.

ARAGORN

We're not going out - not yet.

WILL STOPS, GRABBING HOLD OF HIM, TURNING HIM ROUND -

WILL

So what are we doing?

ARAGORN

(softly)

We're going killing.

WILL

Killing?! Don't be stupid -

Will jerks on Aragorn's arm, starting to haul him back. Aragorn throws off
his hand -

ARAGORN

You do what you like! But I'm the Ranger of the Easterlings -I won't leave
here until it's done.

From behind them - the sounds of pursuit.

WILL

Shit!

He starts to run. Together they disappear into the gloom ahead.

ROW OF CAGE-LIKE CELLS

Will and Aragorn glide past them. They're taking it slowly, very carefully.

Now we see why - ahead of them is a set of steel doors. Torches on either
side illuminate a guard post but there's no sign of the sentry.

Will and Aragorn move closer. They pass -

CREVICE IN THE ROCK

We hold on the narrow opening, looking deep into the shadows. A big ape,
heavily armed, stands there. He has his back to us, his legs spread. A
trickle of water runs down the rock and drains away - he's taking a piss. A
shadow flickers on the wall above him. He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore
shadows -Will and Aragorn are move through the torchlight. The steel doors
are straight ahead.

The sentry slides out of the crevice - he's behind Will. Silently, back
pressed again6t the bars of a cell, he creeps closer to Will. He has a
curved knife in one hand and a short-handled spear in the other. Closer...
closer.

He raises the spear - a rustle of movement. Will spins - he sees the spear
about to thrust. He's a dead man.

An arm? It shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the
sentry's throat, half choking him.

Will leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentry's jaw.
The sentry crumples to the ground, revealing the face of the prisoner. It's
not a man, though -it's an ape. He's in his prime - barrel chested and a
fine head. His name is STRIDER.

He and Will look at each other through the bars.

STRIDER

Two rules in life - never play cards with anyone called Doc and never,
whatever else you do, turn your back on an ape.

Will stares at him. Strider grins. Will smiles back -

WILL

Thanks. I'll remember that.

He starts to search the sentry.

ARAGORN

What are you doing?

WILL

Looking for the keys.

ARAGORN

No!

WILL

He saved our lives.

ARAGORN

He's an ape!

Will shrugs himself free of Aragorn's hand -

WILL

You go and kill as many apes as you like - I'm setting this one free.

Aragorn looks at him. A beat.

ARAGORN

(softly)

It's not apes I'm going to kill.

A PRISON LABORATORY

The heavy steel doors stand open. Inside is a clean and gruesome room -
sinks and instruments along a wall, a series of operating tables and a row
of cages.

Behind the bars are six tribes-people - men, women and a little boy. All of
them carry surgical scars on their heads. It's made two of them blind; the
others stare blankly into space.

Aragorn moves down the cages. Several of them shuffle towards him but
there's no recognition - they're like the walking dead. Aragorn doesn't say
a word. Grim-faced, he loads the crossbow and starts to fire, killing them.

Will and Strider come through the doorway - they see Aragorn going from
cage to cage. Will steps forward, going to stop him. Strider's hand grabs
his shoulder, restraining him.

STRIDER

Leave it. He knows what he's doing.

Will turns and looks at him, questioning.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

The doctors operate on them - up here.

(taps his head)

The tribes think that we steal their souls...

(he pauses - softly)

Maybe they're right.

Aragorn reaches the last cage. A woman - in her 20s - stands in the middle
of the cell, looking at him. Aragorn stares at her face. His lip trembles
with emotion. She tilts her head on one side, as if trying to work
something out. Tears fill Aragorn's eyes. She stumbles a step forward. The
Ranger closes his eyes. He pulls the trigger. A crossbow bolt slams into
her chest and she falls.

Will leans against the doorway, unwilling to watch, staring down the
passageway. He turns at a footfall - Aragorn rejoins them. His voice is
hollow, as if something has died within him -

ARAGORN

It's done. We can go now.

He turns and leads them back down the passageway.

THE WOLVES

There's five of them now, hunting through the slaughter-house in a pack.
All around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and
crannies. The horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves.

Will, Aragorn and Strider are crouched in a corner of the corral, smearing
their bodies with horse manure.

STRIDER

The fresher the better. Cover everything -that's the only way you'll hide
your scent.

The wolves sniff the air, coming closer. Will, staring through the rungs of
the coral, sees their gleaming eyes coming closer. He raises his crossbow,
getting ready.

The wolves stop. They raise their heads and look - the whole cavern is
growing dark. A giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside
world.

The horses rear and buck. The apes are staring - darkness is falling in the
middle of the day. The wolves hackles rise in fear. They howl.

Aragorn and Strider are cowering back

ARAGORN

What is it?

WILL

Come on! Now!

He drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses.

AN UNEARTHLY LIGHT

has fallen on the city. The apes are in confusion - soldiers and workers
are running, children are screaming. A horse has thrown its rider and is
bolting down the terraces.

The darkness grows ever deeper. In the sky, the face of the moon
obliterates the sun - it's a full solar eclipse.

Two horses, flying at a gallop, charge through the doors of the
slaughterhouse. Will is on one, Aragorn clinging to his back. Strider is on
the other. They wheel across an open space, through running apes, and speed
down a terrace.

MA-GOG

steps out on to a rock ledge. He holds a staff in one hand, his cloak
thrown back over his shoulder, magnificent in the eerie light. He stares
down at the chaos. Drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side -

DRAK

What is it?

MA-GOG

(wild)

A sign - the hand of Man passes across the face of God! Lookl He points to
a terrace below - Will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to
the iron bridge. Drak and Ma-Gog stare at them. Darkness engulfs them.

Out of the blackness, an image -

CHRIST ON THE CROSS

It's a stained-glass window in a huge cathedral. A priest is at the altar
conducting Mass for the repose of the dead. We pull back to reveal a tiny
white coffin - just big enough for a baby. Next to it is another coffin.
And another - a row of them.

PRIEST

And even now as sorrow has no end, we find comfort in the words of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Did he not say unto Mark -"suffer the little children to come
unto me, for they are the Kingdom of Heaven. Now and forever." Amen.

The congregation - sad-eyed relatives and weeping parents - fill the pews.

CONGREGATION

Amen.

Pall-bearers lift up the tiny coffins. The organ starts to play. A soloist
- a tenor -steps to the side of the altar. He starts to sing the Latin hymn
"Penis Angelicas". The haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral. They
carry over to -

THE SPACE DOME

is lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day. The clock tower
above the biology building shows the time2.00am. Even so, the area bustles
with activity.

INSIDE THE DOME

An illuminated chart dominates one wall - just like the strategy map in the
Pentagon's war room. Every research center is identified - next to it is
its function and a list of personnel. We see Princeton, Stanford, Texas
A&M, Los Alamos. Tentacles reach out to Oxford, the Pasteur Institute, the
University of Beijing...

Below the chart are nitrogen-cooled Cray super-computers. We track through
teams of men and women processing data, satellite dishes feeding a
communications network, a video conference taking place in a corner,
technicians routing and re-routing phone calls and faxes.

We come to a glass wall. On the other side is Diamond -

A SMALL OFFICE

Glass doors seal out the electronic hum. Diamond, staring through the
glass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent sits on a couch. He's in his
shirt-sleeves, dark rings under his eyes. Next to him is Bob, the young
neurologist. He wears jeans and a t-shirt. On the front it says

"I'll sleep when I'm dead."

The coffee table is piled with files, journal extracts and computer
print-outs. A video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a
screen.

Diamond rubs her eyes, trying to wipe away the fatigue.

DIAMOND

I'm sorry Luc - say that again.

DEMAUPASSANT

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

(kindly)

My fault, Billie - I rattle on too much. The result is - we've fixed the
time frame.

He hits the projector - the image of a fetus developing normally in the
womb appears on the screen... deMAUPASSANT

The fetus develops normally through the first trimester. Then it happens -
about sixteen weeks and two days, everything falls apart. The whole
chemical structure goes out of control -

He flashes up another image - a fetus that is already aging remarkably.
deMAUPASSANT

Once it starts, it's irreversible. If we're going to stop it, we've got to
intercede here -

He points at the slide of the normally developing fetus.

BOB

(taking over)

There's a trigger - some major fucking switch gets turned. That's what I've
been working on. It's definitely in the mDNA. There's a fragment of one
chromosome I'm looking at -

He flicks a switch on the video projector. A slide of a human gene,
massively magnified, popl on to the screen.

BOB (CONT'D)

It's so different, I call it the alien. How it got there, exactly what it
does - I haven't got the first idea.., no fucking idea at all.

Diamond looks at his grim face. He seems totally defeated.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

Is it that bad?

He stares at the floor. There's not even a hint of the former arrogance.

BOB

Someone's dropped us in the middle of the Louvre. We're blind men and
they've told us to find the Mona Lisa. There's four miles of galleries end
we've got five minutes to do it. That's how I feel -and that's when rm
optimistic.

Diamond turns to deMaupassant.

DIAMOND

Luc?

DEMAUPASSANT

I'm sixty-two years old. I've seen us go from DC3s to landing on the moon.
In my life I've won all the glittering prizes. I've always believed nothing
was beyond the reach of Man, but I'll tell you honestly - this may never be
unraveled. If it is, it won't be in my lifetime.

He looks at them. Silence. There's nothing anyone can say. He starts to
gather up his papers-

DEMAUPASSANT (CONT'D)

So what do we do? I think it's like Gatsby -"so we beat on, boats against
the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." There's no other way,
ia there?

They nod their hoods - you have to try. DeMaupaasant and Bob start to
leave.

DIAMOND

Luc?

(he turns))

You're certain - about the time, I mean?

DEMAUPASSANT

(Nodding)

Sixteen weeks. How far along are you?

DIAMOND

Twelve weeks.

They look at one another. The old man speaks gently -

DEMAUPASSANT

Good night, Billie.

A TINY FETUS

perfectly formed - floats in the amniotic fluid. It's alive - the large
head sways, the heart beats through the translucent ribs.

Diamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs. She
lies on a stainless steel table in a hi-tach examination room. A complex
array of equipment -ultra-sounds and scanners - beams down on her exposed
stomach. It projects a , video image onto a screen.

She is alone in the room, manipulating the equipment herself. She stares up
at the child growing in her womb. We see the genitalia.

DIAMOND

So - you're a little boy. It's funny - I think I knew.

She reaches up and gently touches the image of his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

We've got four weeks. The way I see it -there's nothing to lose. I can't
tell you whet'Il happen to us. It's on the edge, mister. The air's so thin
out there, we may not even be able to breathe. But what the hell - it's a
chance.

She takes her hand away and looks at his face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You want to try it? Sure you do. You're my son. We've waited all our lives
for each other.

A STACK OF HAND-WRITTEN NOTEPADS

lie on a table in the basement. We track through them - past computer
print-outs and dog-eared journals. We recognize them - these are Will's
detailed notes.

To the table is the makeshift lab - racks of bottles and syringes. In the
dim light we see Diamond. She removes the catheter from her vein, turns and
climbs up the flotation tank.

INSIDE THE TANK

Water sloshes back and forth. Diamond lowers herself in and floats there.
For a moment, she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the
hatch. We hold on her face.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

So we beat on, boats against the current.

She reaches up and pulls the hatch shut. Clang! Darkness.

THE SUN AND THE MOON

It's one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the
sky together. Smoke drifts across them. We tilt down to ape city -

A column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the
slaughterhouse.

RED HOT FIRE

burns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse. The rickety
conveyor belt is working, clattering away. Several ape workers throw the
bodies of the lab animals - the dead tribes-people - on to the belt.

The body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt. It dumps him into
the furnace. The flames engulf him.

WILL'S EMPTY CELL

The door hangs open. The space is lit by a dozen torches. Drak is alone,
moving around the cell, trying to work out how Will escaped. He looks at
the smashed bed, the hole in the wall, the torn clothing that made the
harness.

He swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock. No answers
there. Lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end.
Drak picks it up. He turns it over in his hand, th!nking about it.

He jumps! One handed he catches hold of the bars above the door.
Effortlessly, he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars. The
nail touches the lock.

DRAK

(to himself)

Clever... you clever fucking animal.

DOCTOR ZORA (O.S.)

My lord...

He turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him.

DOCTOR ZORA (CONT'D)

(urgent)

Could I see you please?

THE HALL OF POWER

is a magnificent room - stone columns and towering trees growing in huge
pots. At one end is a rock shelf - open to the gathering twilight.
Silhouetted against it, commanding a view of the entire city, is the
Council of Elders. They sit around a table made from bone and tusks, deep
in discussion.

Nazgul looks up - he sees Drak approaching through the shadows.

NAZGUL

Drak. I was just saying - maybe it's a blessing.

DRAK

A blessing?

NAZGUL

Where there's one, there must be others. If we'd killed him, we might never
find them.

MA-GOG

But the animal's not stupid - he knows come day-break we'll be tracking
him. Who's to say he'll run for home?

Drak stops in front of them.

DRAK

No - he's not stupid. But even dogs hunt in packs of seven. Every animal
needs its kind. And when we find them - what then?

MA-GOG

What do you think?!

DRAK

Just like the tribes - burn them out of their holes, put them to the sword?
I don't mind doing that - I like it - but it's never enough, is it? No
matter how many we kill, every year they're still here. Why will it be any
different with the Blue Eyes? What we need is a final solution.

NAZGUL And where do we find that?

DRAK (CONT'D)

Doctor Zora's brought back patients from a place called Kismatu. I've been
talking to her about it -

Several of the Council are looking at each other - perplexed.

MA-GOG

What is Kismatu?

NAZGUL

It's a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier. Females and
babies have been dying there.

He turns to Drak - his eyes intense, very interested.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Go on.

COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

There are iron barn on I series of high windows but in the middle of the
room is a jungle-gym. Underneath it are ape toys. Five baby apes sit on
cots. They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end
bodies are those of old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.

A double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock. Hanging on them is a sign

"Quarantine. No Entry".

Drak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children. Doctor Zora is
with them - she's nervous, twisting her fingers.

DOCTOR ZORA

We don't know what causes it- a virus probably. I'd hoped to complete our
research before I came to you with my proposal. But, given the
circumstances -

NAZGUL I

It's a brilliant idea.

(turns and smiles at her)

Brilliant.

HORSES' HOOVES

paw the ground. They're bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail. It's
night -the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock.

Will and Strider have made camp - a hare roasts over the fire. Aragorn sits
well apart - a silhouette in the moonlight - staring out into the forest,
lost in his thoughts. Will and Strider look at him.

STRIDER

He's their leader - he can never take his eye from the mountain. He has to
do what he thinks is right.

WILL

(hard)

By killing them?

STRIDER

Don't judge him, Will. I couldn't have done it. I wonder if you could? One
of those women he just killed wes his daughter.

Will reacts. He turns and stares at the silhouette. A long beat.

WILL

(quietly)

We call it a Iobotomy. What other things have you people tried?

He turns to face him. Strider shrugs. There's something about it -
something almost evasive.

WILL (CONT'D)

Fuck you, Strider! Tell me!

He stares at Will - he's never seen him angry.

STRIDER

don't know if it's true.., my sister's mate works in the lab. He says
Doctor Zora's working on some disease -

Will comes towards him -

WILL

What sort of disease?

STRIDER

Of the children, I think - ape children.

WILL

How did they die, Strider? Old in the belly -is that how?!

STRIDER

Some of them. You know this disease?

Will stares at him, taking it in.

WILL

(softly)

So that's how it happened. Fuck you people.

STRIDER

They haven't done it yet. It may not work.

WILL

They will and it does.

He turns end takes step towards the forest. He runs his fingers through his
hair -WILL God help us.

STRIDER

That's funny - that's exactly what an ape would say.

Will turns. He and Strider stare at one another - the ape and the man, both
struck by the sudden commonality.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

I'm sorry...

Will walks slowly back to the fire. Strider starts to strip the meat off a
hare he's roasting over the flames. He offers it to Will. He shakes his
head - he's not hungry anymore. He stares into the flames -

WILL

What about you, Strider - why were you in the cell?

STRIDER

I fought another ape. Nothing very heroic, I'm afraid - I was drunk. He
fell badly, his head hit the branch of a tree going down. It broke his
neck.

He pauses We're not like humans. An ape never kills one of his own. Never.

WILL

What's the punishment?

STRIDER

At the ceremony of summer rites, the high priest would curse me with death.

I would have been left to die in the forest -no journey over the waterfall,
no-one to say the sacred words. Without that, no ape can walk in the next
world. You saved my life, Will and I'm grateful. But there's nothing I can
do about my soul. I'm a dead ape walking.

Strider stripe more meet off the hare. Will picks up a saddle and blanket
and starts to make himself bed.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

You knew, didn't you? You knew the sun was going to swallow the moon.
That's why you weren't afraid.

Will pauses - then he turns to him.

WILL

Yes - I knew.

STRIDER

WHO ARE YOU, WILL?

WILL

I've come a long way, Strider - it's farther then I can explain.

STRIDER

I've heard stories - old apes tell them 'round the fire late at night - of
strange lands where the creatures can tell the future. Is that where you're
from?

WILL

In a way.. yeah, it's something like that.

STRIDER

So what happens to it afl, to the world we've built? Tell me that.

WILL

It passes away.

Strider stares at him through the firelight.

STRIDER

History remembers, though - it's passed on, what we did, I mean?

WILL

No, Strider - there's nothing, not a trace left behind.

Strider thinks for a moment, then he smiles gently.

STRIDER

So it's just vanity then - what we believe, that the works of the ape will
last forever?

WILL

Yes, it's vanity. But not just of apes, Strider -maybe of men, too.

He turns and settles down on his makeshift bed. Strider - the food
forgotten - stares out into the night. A million stars hang on a velvet
sky.

Look down from them - in the vast blackness of the forest, one tiny
lightthe flickering fire.

DUST SWIRLING, HOOVES POUNDING

battalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables. Dawn is breaking across
the city. Ma-Gog stands on a ridge, his staff raised, blessing the army as
it rides out.

At its head is Drak. He clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down
the avenue of idols. Votive fires burn in front of every statue.

A RAINBOW

arches across the end of a tiny gorge. Dozens of streams cascade into
pools, spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds. Aragorn leads Will and
Strider along a hidden, path - a rock ledge that runs behind the
waterfalls.

The ledge widens into a large cave. Sunlight streams through a veil of
cascading water. Aragorn looks around - something's worrying him.

ARAGORN

This is the Rainbow Tribe's cave. They should be here.

A STONE FIREPLACE

Aragorn places his hand on the circle of stones, feeling its warmth.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

They left at the rising of the sun.

He moves deeper into the cave - a maze of limestone caverns and
passage-ways. He stops at sleeping area - weapons lie there, food in
baskets.

ARAGORN

(softly)

Why such hurry?

Suddenly he stops, listening. He looks at Strider -

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

You heard it?

Strider nods his head - yes. Will hasn't heard a thing. He listens hard -
nothing.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Animal?

STRIDER

I don't think so.

Strider moves silently to the side of the cave. He picks up a crossbow.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Is there another entrance?

ARAGORN

From the ridge above. Apes?

STRIDER

Scouts probably.

He cocks the crossbow. Aragorn has picks up a bow and spear. He moves
towards a cavern, signaling Strider to take a passageway.

Will grabs a crossbow. Strider tosses him a chain mail vest - armor. They
move off.

HONEYCOMB OF PASSAGES

eep in the cave. A sound - pebbles falling off a ledge. Then we see a
flicker of light - a torch is moving through a cavern. Whoever holds it,
turns a corner and is lost in darkness.

A CROSSROADS

of arches and stalactites. Will and Strider split apart. Will moves
silently through the darkness, into a cavern. Through an archway he sees a
shadow on the wall! He goes fast towards it -

A HUGE BOULDER

The shadow comes round the boulder. We tilt down and now we see who's
holding the torchDiamondl She's armed with a crossbow - cocked end loaded.
She turns a corner -

Ten feet in front of her is Strider. She stares at the massive ape's back -
a bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder. Her eyes widen with fear.
She raises the crossbow -

Strider hears it. He spins, weapon rising -

turns into a passage midway between them. He sees Diamond about to fire. He
screams -

Too late - she pulls the trigger! Will hurls himself forward - in front of
Strider. Whack! The arrow blasts into his chest. He crashes to the ground.

Diamond stares down at him.

DIAMOND

Will!

His eyes open - he's gasping for breath from the impact. He and Diamond
look at one another. Strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of Will's
chain mail armor. Diamond's shoulders sag with relief.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(indicates Strider Who's he?

WILL

I'll explain later.

He struggles to his feet and looks at Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

What made you come? I thought the mDNA was just a theory. One of dozens of
theories - isn't that what you said?

DIAMOND

We did a lot of work. I guess I was wrong.

WILL

People have been wrong about a lot of things.

THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.

WILL (CONT'D)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering, snow-capped peak.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -
we've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be
done, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time. How long has science dreamed of that?

DIAMOND

How long have you?

WILL

All my life.

DIAMOND

Dream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

WILL

(softly)

Yeah - I really have, haven't I?

Diamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -

STRIDER (O.S.)

Aragorn - I've found it!

A CAVE PAINTING

Newly-drawn, is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave. Strider, Will
and Diamond watch aa Aregorn looks at it by torchlight.

ARAGORN

I thought they would leave word for their hunters. Kip-Kena has called a
gathering of the Seven Tribes.

WILL

Where?

ARAGORN

Two days' travel - at the Eagle's Nest.

He looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

We'll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave at first light.

THE EMBERS OF A FIRE

burn in the circle of stones. Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it.
Will and Diamond have been awake all night. They sit in the shadows near
the entrance to the cave, speaking quietly.

DIAMOND

An ape civilization? You said there was a city.., what happened to it all?

WILL

You know what we've found of Aragorn's whole race? Seventeen bones, that's
all. Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them
skulls. Bones last a lot longer than civilizations.

DIAMOND

I guess there's a lesson in that.

WILL

Listen, Billie - the apes have discovered a disease.

Diamond reacts. Will crouches down - in the dirt he scratches out a small
chain of circles. It's a molecule.

WILL (CONT'D)

It's really rare and, lucky for them, it's in an isolated area. They're not
stupid - they understand it's potential. They plan to give it to the tribes
-

He draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow-legged stick figure of a man.

WILL (CONT'D)

And maybe they do, but it doesn't matter -Aragorn's people aren't us.
Already evolution's taken another track -

scratches a cross through the bow-legged man. He draws the figure of an
upright human.

WILL (CONT'D)

Somewhere in the rift valley is someone like us - the first man.

DIAMOND

Woman. You said it was in the mitochondrial DNA - it has to be a woman.

She reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figure's head.

WILL

You're right. Sooner or later the apes find her. She doesn't look like the
tribes but the apes don't care - she's human.

So they give her the disease. She's different though - it doesn't work, or
at least it doesn't seem to. It gets integrated into her. It's passed on,
it mutates, it weaves its way into the mDNA. It lies there - a bomb waiting
to go off. And then one day -

DIAMOND

After a hundred thousand years?

WILL

The planet's five billion years old. What's that to Nature? A blink of the
eye.

Will throws the stick down on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's the theory, anyway.

DIAMOND

(impressed)

A helluva theory, Doctor Plant.

HE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

There's not much time, Will. We have to find her before the apes and we
have to do it within four weeks.

WILL

Jesus, Billie! Four weeks? We've got a theory - that's all. We don't even
know half the problems we're dealing with. You can't put a deadline on
science.

DIAMOND

Science, Will? What about people? Isn't that what this is all about. I'm
sorry - I thought there were children dying.

WILL

Sure. Of course it's about that too.

DIAMOND

But then, you don't care muchabout people do you?

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -

WILL

No - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what
matter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.

DIAMOND

Progress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up
to believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that
mean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I
came? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a
child -that's why I'm here.

They look at one another.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Uke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with
them?

(indicates Aragore and Strider)

We should cut ourselves loose.

WILL

We wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like
storm-troopers.

DIAMOND

Where are they now?

WILL

Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head.

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.

ARAGORN

Ready?

A SPARKLING RIVER

winds through a beautiful valley. The two horses splash along the water's
edge. Strider and Aragorn are mounted on one, Will and Diamond on the
other. They turn a curve - Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into
the forest.

THE CAVE OF THE RAINBOW

Ape soldiers are swarming over the cave. A TRACKER uses torchlight to study
footprints. He looks up at Orak -

TRACKER

There's four of them, my Lord.

DRAK

Four? The Tracker points It a at of prints -

TRACKER

It's woman. Blue Eyes has a mate.

DRAK

Excellent. I look forward to meeting her.

SOLDIER (O.S.)

My Lord - hoof prints.

Drak turns - the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of
the cave. Drak looks up - high above he sees a slash of daylight. It's
another entrance.

DRAK

Malakai! Bolag!

Two heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers. With Drak they
run for the wall. They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing
tiny ledges.

Other apes follow them. They scramble up the wall with amazing speed.

AN EAGLE CIRCLES

Soaring and hovering in the sky. We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in
skins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak. He's a
LOOKOUT. He tenses -

Four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff. The
Lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle. It carries down to -

SERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS

are built into the rocky crags, opening into caves. They are connected by
ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live
with their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.

The platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes. People turn
at the Lookout's cry. A man pushes through, listening - it's Kip-Kena.

THE LOOKOUT POST

Kip follows the direction of the Lookout's pointing finger. Will and
Diamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path.

KIP

It's the traveler! With a woman...

The Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming
closer.

LOOKOUT

The fool - he's brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kip's
hand falls on his arm, stopping him.

KIP

Who's the other one, though?

(realizing)

Aragorn!

He turns, yelling down to the platforms -

KIP (CONT'D)

It's the Ranger! The Ranger is free!

ON THE PLATFORMS

The tribes-people burst into action - running for the bridges, scaling the
ladders.

A WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR

Whack! It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It's a
primitive drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.

The tribes-people are gathering, eager to greet him. Then they see Strider.
A ripple of fear and anger runs through them.

ARAGORN

The ape travels with me - treat him as a friend.

Nobody argues with the Ranger. He stops in front of Kip. The young warrior
starts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him. He puts out his arms - they
embrace.

Will crosses the bridge. Kip sees him. He grasps Will's arm in greeting -

KIP

You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life. Welcome, Traveler.

INSIDE THE EAGLE'S NEST

A series of caves, connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain.
They're crowded with members of various tribes - children are playing,
flint-knappers are fashioning tools, women ara cooking.

A shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall. Kip and Will have
found a quiet place amid the bustle.

WILL

Are the seven tribes here?

KIP

All except the Antelope. They hunt the plains far to the west - they have
the longest journey.

WILL

Will they come?

KIP

Who knows - maybe the apes have found them. Nobody has seen them for many
summers gone. Why?

WILL

I'm searching for someone - a young woman. She looks like us ...

(he indicates Diamond))

I thought she might live with the tribes.

KIP

Is she a relative - was she born to your hearth?

WILL

To all of our hearths. My race reveres her. We think of her as the first
woman. Without her. our lives are nothing.

KIP

(nodding his head)

Women are of the spirit - we believe that. too. Mother Earth mates with the
totems. Only through woman can their children walk the world.

WILL

Have you seen her?

KIP

NO.

WILL

You're sure? Perhaps some of the women have seen something?

KIP

She looks like you, you say? No offense, Traveler, but the women say you're
the ugliest man they've ever seen. A woman that looks like you - I'm sure
they would have talked about it.

WILL

Ugly?

They smile at one another.

KIP

I'm sorry I can't help.

A torch flares below. Kip looks down into an adjoining cave. It's empty
except for a group of men - all warriors - filing in. These are the leaders
of each of the tribes.

ANOTHER TORCH IS LIT

They ring the walls of the small cave. By their light we see the skins, the
feathers and the symbols of each tribe's totem - the eagle, the tiger, the
rainbow...

Beneath each one squats its leader. One place is empty - the Tribe of the
Antelope. Will sits near the entrance. He watches Aragorn - dressed in
ceremonial robes, the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to
his feet.

ARAGORN

We've traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind. The ape says
it's an army.

KIP

And there are more coming from the north. Five squadrons et least, the
runners say. It's led by the old warrior Nazgul.

ARAGORN

Is that why you called the gathering?

KIP

Great things are moving, Ranger -

An old man, battle-scarred and gray, leans forward. He is the leader of the
Rainbow.

A RAINBOW

A stranger walks out of the west, the moon hides the sun, armies are on the
march - come the new moon, nothing in Middle Earth will be the same.

Others nod their heads in agreement.

KIP (CONT'D)

We either fight or flee - the Tribes must decide.

ARAGORN

I know you, Kip - you always were a fighter. What do the others say?

warrior in a feathered cloak speaks -

EAGLE

It doesn't matter what we say - the Ranger has returned. We'll follow
wherever he leads.

Aragorn looks at their faces. Slowly he shakes his head -

ARAGORN

I'll walk the path Mother Earth has laid for me, but I'll walk it no more
as Ranger.

The leaders stare at him. Several start to object but he silences them with
his hand -

ARAGORN

A man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine.

(softly)

I took the life of my daughter - and some of your kinfolk with it. I did my
duty -nothing more can be asked of I men. But now others must walk in my
place.

He walks forward, unfastening the Crescent of Light. He stops in front of
Kip -

ARAGORN

If I should have had a son, I would have hoped for a man as fine as you.
This is my last act as Ranger of the Easterlings-

He reaches out and slips the Crescent of Light around Kip's neck.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

Take care of my father's people. Guide them well.

(he looks at the leaders)

You must decide what is best for the Tribes. For me... I was the one that
had to strike the blow, but it was the apes who killed my child. Tomorrow I
will go to fight them. What father could do any less?

He turns away and walks towards the entrance. Only Will sees the tears in
his eyes.

KIDS' FACES, WIDE-EYED

They huddle together - staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape.
Strider is building a small fire at the side of the cave, Diamond lays down
furs for sleeping. , She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the
meeting. Will approaches.

WILL

They're going to war. They leave at dawn.

STRIDER

They'll be slaughtered.

WILL

They think if they leave the valley, their totems won't follow. Without
them, they say they're dead anyway.

DIAMOND

We should go now.

Will looks at her. She meets his gaze. Suddenly she realizes -

DIAMOND

Oh, nol We're not fighting someone else's war -

WILL

Listen to me -

DIAMOND

We've got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to find her. She's not here, so whet
are we waiting for? Let's go!

The tribes-people turn at the raised voices. Will takes Diamond's arm and
guides her to a private corner -

WILL

Listen, Billie! We know the future - but if we beat the apes, they can't
harm the woman.

DIAMOND

Beat the apes?! And say we don't - or say one of us gets captured. What
then? Don't you understand? Four weeksi

WILL

Yeah, I understand - but those things aren't going to happen. We know
things the apes can't even dream of. This is our world, Billie - men won it
with their minds. All we need is knowledge and science. We've got them
both. We can win!

DIAMOND

What are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus? This is an army, Will
- you said it yourself. Storm-trooperst

WILL

Look -

He bends and picks up s rock from the ground. He hands it to Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

Taste it. That's saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate. The
caves are littered with the stuff. You've smelt the air - there's sulfur
all around. If we burn timber, that'Il give us charcoal. You're s scientist
- you know what it means.

Sure - she knows what it means. She stares at him.

DIAMOND

It's strange, isn't it? Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks
about is weapons.

WILL

We're a frail species, Billea. It's only weapons that have made us bigger
than we are.

DIAMOND

Or smaller.

WILL

It's the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this. We can
beat themi No more experiments - no more problem.

DIAMOND

(quietly)

I hope your right, Will.

FIRES BURN

all over the eagle's nest, turning piles of timber into charcoal. The camp
is a hive of activitycolumns of tribes-people make their way up from the
valley carrying piles of sulfur rock; women and children sit in circles,
pounding the saltpeter into dust. Will moves among the tribal leaders,
watching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls.

Strider sits apart, watching, not sure if the humans have lost their minds.

STRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US

He looks like a scarecrow except he's dressed in captured ape armor. Rigged
to a flying fox, he speeds past a rock face. All of the tribes-people are
gathered on the side of a crevasse, watching.

The straw men flies closer - towards a rocky outcrop. Will touches a
burning ember to the ground. We see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but
we lose it among the rocks. A thin trail of smoke marks its passage.

The tribes-people watch - nothing seems to be happening. Suddenly - just as
the straw man reaches the outcrop -

Ka-boom! A huge explosion. Fire and flying rock hit the straw men.

The tribes-people scream. Terrified, they turn and run. Smoke and dust
obscure the flying fox. Will walks forward to examine his handiwork.

Tribes-people peer out from their hiding places - the smoke and dust clear.
They see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope.
Several of the women start to cry in fear.

Will stands on the edge of the crevasse. He turns - Kip, Aragorn and the
other leaders are approaching. They look at him with trepidation.

KIP

You make fire from rocks of the earth -what is this thing?

WILL

Gunpowder.

Kip turns to the others. They repeat the word, as if that will unlock its
mystery.

WILL (CONT'D)

We've still got work to do.

He turns and goes. The tribes-people, emboldened by their leaders, come
closer. They draw back from Will as he makes his way through them. He comes
face to face with Strider. The man and the ape look at one another.

STRIDER

Apes believe men are the devil's children. Maybe they're right. What have
you done, Will - what have you unleashed on the world?

WILL

Nothing, Strider. The future, that's all.

STRIDER

I can't fight with you tomorrow, Will. To kill an ape in a brawl is one
thing, but I can't go to war against my people.

WILL

(kindly)

I never expected you to.

Again they look at one another. Will turns and leaves.

WATER FLYING, HOOVES POUNDING

Drak and his cavalry, pennants flying, gallop along the edge of a river.
Ranks of infantry, followed by horse-drawn supply wagons, travel behind.

The river swings around a point thick with trees. We crane up above the
foliage - a tributary flows clown the other side. Marching through the
shallows is another army of apes. At their head, on a stallion, is Nazgul.

The two squadrons converge at the end of the point. The foot soldiers meld
together, the Praetorian Guard splash ahead, Drak and Nazgul ride side by
side. Ahead, the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge. It's
a natural weir -

THE FORD OF THE THREE RIVERS

A jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the
river. The Praetorian Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir.

The Guard spur their horses forward, forcing them through the fast-running
current, crossing to the other side -

IN THE TREES

A shadow of movement. Tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the
forest, almost invisible in skins and camouflage.

Will and Kip stand motionless, deep in shadow. They watch as the Guard on
their horses come thundering across the ford, straight towards them. The
infantry are close behind. Will drops his hand -

TRAILS OF FIRE

whip along the ground - out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks
that form part of the ford. The Guards' horses shy away. The apes look down
in puzzlement -

Boom! Boom! Booml Sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water.
Apes are cut to pieces, horses are hurled into the fast-flowing water.

On the far side - Orak's horse rears up. He drives his spurs into its
flanks, trying to control it. Clouds of dust and smoke billow across the
weir, the wounded are screaming - the ape cavalry wheel and turn in
confusion.

Drak plunges forward - chaos all around him. He pounds his chest with both
fists and roars -

DRAK

Apes - chargel

The apes still on their horses hear his cry. They spur their mounts
forward. The first of the cavalry reach -

THE SHORE

Boom... boom! More explosions rip the river bank to pieces.

IN THE FOREST

Batteries of cross-bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames. The
Eagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other, touching flames to
rope fuses. Fire sizzles towards the crossbows, each one loaded with a
charge -

Bam...bam...bamf The scores of crossbows fire.

ON THE FORD

The ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris. Wham! The hail
of arrows cut them to pieces.

Drak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses. He looks
through the smoke - into the forest. He sees Will, standing on a rock with
Kip, like a general commanding his army.

Drak bellows with rage. He snaps the reins, about to drive his horse
onward. An arrow flies in from the flank. Whackt It slams into Drak's chest
armor, splintering. He turns -

THE JUMBLE OF LOGS

floats in the middle of the river. The leader of the Rainbow Tribe, water
streaming off of him, kneels on the tangle of trees and branches, reloading
his bow. This is no jumble of logs - it's a firing platform they've
anchored therel

dozen Rainbow warriors, hidden in the water, clamber out of the river. They
kneel next to their leader, drlwing their bows -

THE FORD

Drak watches es I flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes.
Right in front of him, an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of
the Praetorian Guard. Drak turns to Nazgul, yelling -

DRAK

The ones in the river - take themi Nazgul spurs his horse back across the
weir.

ON THE SHORE

Ape cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank. Bam! They hear the
charges go off - the hurl themselves down. Another volley of arrows scythes
through them -

IN THE FOREST

The Eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the
batteries of crossbows. One of the warriors looks up - terror on his face.

Drak, followed by the remnants of his Praetorian Guard, charge through the
blue haze of gunsmoke - straight towards them.

One of the crossbow batteries fires! Arrows hit his horse's armor but Drak
doesn't falter. Crouched Iow in the saddle, he spins the Gatling gun like a
gunslinger. He locks it under his arm.

The eagle warriors start to break and run. The apes' horses sound like
thunder rolling closer. The Eagle leader and several of his warriors stand
their ground, desperately working to reload.

They spin the battery, sighting straight at Drak's chest. They fire! Arrows
fly -

Drak leaps out of the saddle! He catches hold of an overhanging bough. The
arrows whiz underneath, skimming his butt. He leaps again - higher into the
tree.

The Eagle leader looks up - sunlight sparkles on the leaves. It's dazzling
-

Smash! Drak's sword cleaves through one of the warriors. Drak has dropped
to the ground, right behind them. The Eagle leader turns - too latel
Rat-a-tat-tat! The Gatling gun fires. Arrows shred the Eagle leader's
feathered coat. He crumples to the ground like some fallen bird.

THE FORD

The ape infantry pour across the ford, charging over the bodies of their
fallen comrades.

THE FOREST

Riderless horses, part of the ape cavalry, charge wildly through the trees.
We tilt up - their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees. The
branches are thick with apes firing, cutting down groups of running
tribesmen.

THE ROCK PLATFORM

Will and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron
barrel wedged in the rocks. One of the warriors tilts it up, aiming it at
the trees; another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel.

Will touches an ember to a fuse. Everyone dives for cover -

Boom! The primitive cannon fires. The shrapnel hits the trees. Shredded
apes, branches and leaves fall to the ground.

Will and the warriors reload. Again they fire - but the charge is too big.
The whole cannon breaks free of the rocks. It flies like a missile and
smashes into the trunk of a tree. Timber!

A ROCKY GORGE

Its rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders. Aragorn and a group
of warriors are fighting hand-to-hand, being forced back by scores of ape
infantry.

Aragorn drives his spear at a huge ape. The point plunges into the animal's
belly, up and under his armor. Blood spurts out from the joins in the
metal.

IN THE TREES

An ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow - straight at Aragorn. He
fires -

AMONG THE BOULDERS

Wham! The crossbow bolt smashes into Aragorn's shoulder, sending him
reeling. One of the tribesmen turns - it's Kip. He sees Aragorn on his
knees.

Kip wields a sword, fighting his way towards Aragorn. Slash! He takes one
ape across the chest. Whaml Another ape in the neck. He grabs Aragorn and
starts to drag him out of the melee.

IN THE TREES

The ape sharpshooter has Kip in his sights. His finger reaches for the
trigger. He starts to squeeze -

Sswhishl The sound of an arrow. Whackl It buries itself in the
sharpshooter's neck. He falls out of the tree -

HIGH AMONG THE BOULDERS

Will. He stands almost at the top of the gorge, lowering a crossbow. He
looks down at Kip's men - the apes, vastly superior in numbers, are
swarming forward, driving the tribesmen back.

On a ridge below him, four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder. A
flash of fire then - Ka-bam!

ON THEGROUND

Apes are rushing forward. They hear the explosion. Several apes turn - the
huge boulder, split into chunks, flies towards them. The apes scatter.
Smashl The chunks knock apes aside like skittles.

But there's more of them behind, spilling in to the gorge, over-running it
-

THE DUST FROM THE EXPLOSION

swirls past Drak. He looks up - he sees Will on the ridge, silhouetted
against the sky.

Drak snarls deep in his throat. He wheels his horse and gallops hard
towards a trail that winds up among the boulders.

ON THE RIDGE

Will moves fast along the top of the ridge. He stops - looking down on the
river. On the other side, Nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather
bladders from the wagons and empty them into the river.

Will shades hil ayes - the water glistens with iridescent colors. He
realizes - it's oil.

The current carries it straight towards the platform in the river. The
warriors of the Rainbow tribe - unaware - are still aboard, firing at the
apes on the ford.

Will turns fait - wa whip pan along the shoreline. He sees what he feared -
two apes below him with a fire burning. They slot flaming arrows into their
crossbows -

Will unslings his crossbow, steadies himself and fires -

Ks-whack! The arrow rips through one ape's neck. He pitches forward -
heed-first into the fire. The other ape hurls himself aside, diving for
cover.

Will re-loads. The side of the ape's head is just visible behind a rock. If
Will makes this, it's going to be a helluva shot.

His finger curls around the trigger - right behind him, the sound of
hooves. Will spins

it's Drak charging towards him. He raises the Gatling gun -

Will aims at the big ape's throat and fires.

Drak swerves. The arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed
forearm. The Gatling gun flies from his hand.

There's no time for Will to re-load - he turns and runs.

Drak charges down on him. He draws a harpoon out of its scabbard.

Will scrambles over a crest - nothing but thin air!

Drak has him square in his sights. He draws back his arm, about to hurl the
harpoon. Will throws himself forward -

THE SIDE OF A CLIFF

Will falls down, down, down.

Drak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge. He looks over - Will
plunges towards the river, flowing fast below the ford.

Splash! Will cannonballs into the water and disappears. Drak stares down,
trying to catch sight of him. Nothing.

IN THE RIVER

A tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current.
A pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it. Will's head
follows.

Gasping, catching his breath, he looks upstream - the water pours over the
weir. A flaming arrow arcs through the air. The ape on the shore has done
his job -

THE OIL SLICK

erupts in flames as the arrow hits it. The whole surface of the river is
suddenly transformed into a raging blaze.

The Rainbow leader and his men turn. They see a wall of flame racing
towards them. Several warriors dive into the water, swimming for the shore
-

Whoosh! The flames engulf them. A wall of fire sweeps over the wooden
platform. Like macabre shadows - we see the dancing shapes of the dying
warriors.

IN THE RIVER

The current pulls Will down the river. He looks back - the molten fire
spills over the weir. Anguished screams are carried on the wind. A pillar
of black, oily smoke rises up high into the sky -

THE EAGLES' NEST

The platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women, children and
old folks. Diamond and Strider stand together. All of them stare down at
the river valley. The pillar of smoke rises higher.

WOMAN (O.S.)

They're here!

Diamond turns - the woman is standing on the highest platform. Diamond
follows the direction of her outstretched arm.

A group of warriors, followed by their women-folk and children, are coming
round the mountain path. Their leader wears a golden fur and a head-dress
of auroch's horns. It's the Tribe of the Antelope.

OUTSIDE THE MAIN CAVE

A chorus of chattering voices. The new arrivals are surrounded by members
of their sister tribes. The leader of the Antelope stands in the center,
listening to a woman -Kip's wife. Whatever she's saying is lost in the
hubbub.

ANTELOPE

Quiet!

Instantly, the voices die.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

(anxious)

Where?

Kip's wife doesn't answer - she walks forward and points to the pillar of
smoke. The Antelope leader turns to his warriors.

ANTELOPE (CONT'D)

We go - now!

DIAMOND AND STRIDER

stand on the platform, watching several old men lower the drawbridge.
Whack! It locks into place. The antelope warriors cross it and disappear
down a narrow trail.

The rest of the Antelope tribe move towards the cave. Diamond turns away -
then she stops. Something has caught her eye. She stares at the crowd of
women and children heading into the cave.

STRIDER

What is it?

Diamond doesn't answer - she tenses. In the milling crowd of brown bodies,
she sees it again - a flash of gold. It*s sunlight on blonde hair.

DIAMOND

She's here.., holy God - she's herel It's not a woman - it's a child!

She grabs a rope ladder, ignores the rungs and slithers down it.

A YOUNG GIRL

helps her mother set up camp. She is about 10 years old, tawny-haired,
taller and straighter-backed'than any of her people. She looks like us.

Diamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth. She
stops. The young girl turns. For a moment she and Diamond stare at one
another, separated by a hundred thousand years, but so similar they can
both see themselves in the other.

THE YOUNG GIRL SMILES. DIAMOND RETURNS IT -

DIAMOND

What's your name?

The girl's mother stares, amazed to see someone who looks like her child.

MOTHER

Her name is Aiv.

DIAMOND

Ev?

(Realizing)

Of course. My people have a name like that - "Eve" is how we say it.

The mother nods - the sound seems to please her. Diamond puts out her arms
and indicates the young girl. The mother smiles, giving her permission.
Diamond puts her arms around Eve.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

(softly)

I've come a long way to find you.

Eve looks at her - wide-eyed, innocent.

EVE

Why?

DIAMOND

To keep you safe.

She holds her tight. The mother catches Diamond's eye.

MOTHER

Do you have children?

Diamond shakes her head - no. The mother can't hide her disappointment.

DIAMOND

What's wrong?

MOTHER

I was hoping you had a son. Aiv's a sweet girl. She's the child of my
heart. But the way she looks, nobody will want her as a mate.

Before Diamond can answer there's a commotion outside the cave. She turns
to look - Strider and tribes-people are running out into the daylight.

SWIRLS OF DUST

rise up from I mountain path. Whatever's causing it is hidden from view by
the peaks and crags. The tribal-people gather on vantage points, watching
it come closer. Strider cocks his head - listening. A shadow of fear passes
across his face.

STRIDER

Horses! It's horses!

Horses mean apesi Panic sweeps through the tribes-people. Women grab their
children, young kids start screaming, old men and boys scramble for
weapons.

Diamond weaves through the flying mass of people. She swings up on to a
platform beside Strider. He points -

Coming into view on the mountain path - running and stumbling, dragging
their wounded - are what's left of the Antelope warriors.

Their women-folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates.
The warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge. Nobody raised
it when they left -

Several old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it. They haul on
the ropes and pulleys. It starts to swing upwards -

Here he comes - Drak! He's galloping hard at the head of his cavalry,
battle scarred and bloodied. He sees the drawbridge starting to lift. He
doesn't pause - he whips his horse into a thundering gallop.

The bridge rises higher. Drak's horse leaps! It soars across the crevasse -
the giddylng drop stretches out below - and lands on the lifting bridge.

The men and boys stare in horror. Orak charges down on them. They back away
-all except one boy, not even in his teens, who stands his ground.

Swish! Drak's sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist. The other tribesmen
run. Wham! The drawbridge falls back into place. The ape cavalry charge
across it.

BROAD WOODEN PLATFORM

An ape horseman flies across the platform. He leaps off the edge, on to a
lower platform. Diamond's right in front of him!

She throws herself aside, grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto -

A ROCK SHELF

She looks across the broad area in front of the cave - apes everywhere,
weapons flashing, people screaming.

A young boy tries to out-run an ape warrior - it's Gray Beard. The young
boy hasn't got a chance. Gray Beard lashes out at him with a stock-whip.

It curls around the boy's ankle, tripping him. The boy looks up - he tries
to shield his face. Too late! The horse's hooves smash down -

Diamond looks away, unable to watch. She sees Eve. The young girl is at the
front of the cave, spinning in panic. Her mother runs towards her...

The mother doesn't see Gray Beard galloping towards her. Diamond screams a
warning but it's just one more crv in the commotion.

Gray Beard raises a short-handled lance and hurls it like a javelin. It
hits the mother in the small of the back, straight through the spine. She
pitches forward - dead. Eve screams and runs towards her mother.

Diamond leaps off the rock ledge -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Diamond runs faster than she's ever run, sprinting to grab Eva. Drak wheels
his horse - he sees Diamond. His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the
Blue Eyes! And a woman! He leaps his horse forward -

DRAK

Grab the female!

Gray Beard is off his horse. Diamond runs towards him. He raises a
crossbow...

Drak charges down on her from behind. He holds the harpoon at his shoulder.
He aims at her legs.

Diamond races on - her only thought, to save Eve. It'll never happen -
she's as good as deadGray Beard's in front, aiming. Drak's right behind. He
hurls the harpoon.

Whoosh! Strider swings through the air. He clings to one of the rope
ladders - it's like Tarzan, except he's an ape. He grabs Diamond by the
scruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way.

Drak's harpoon skims past them. Gray Beard stares in amazement at the woman
flying through the air. But that's not his big surprise - with Diamond out
of the way, the harpoon is flying straight at him. He screams as it rips
into his throat.

HIGH ROCK LEDGE

Strider - Diamond clutched under his arm - lands on a ledge high above the
fight. Diamond turns fast and looks back -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Eve crouches over the body of her mother. The woman's mouth is frozen in an
anguished scream, her dead eyes stare straight ahead. Eva shakes her,
desperately hoping for some sign of life. Nothing. Eve starts to cry.

A dark shadow falls across her. She looks up - it's Drak. He reaches down
and grabs her by the neck. He beats his chest with his fist and raises her
up above his head like a trophy.

ON THE ROCK LEDGE

Diamond, anguished, tries to go to the little girl but Strider holds her in
an iron grip. He swings Diamond off her feet, and leaps for an overhanging
branch of a tree. He jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from
sight.

CHARRED AND SMOKING WRECKAGE

floats at the shore of the river. It is what remains of the firing platform
- the bodies of several of the Rainbow warriors still on board.

Smoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest. The only
sound is the whinnying of a horse - it has a broken leg. Again and again it
tries to get to its feet.

A solitary figure makes his way through the shadows. It's Will, soaking wet
from the river. He stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at
the carnage all around him. So much for knowledge and science. This is
where the warriors of the tribes made their last stand - their bodies lie
huddled together in a jumble.

Will stares at them, anguish on his face.

WILL

(softly, to himself)

I was so sure...

He kneels and turns one of the bodies over. It's Kip - speared through the
chest. A shaft of sunlight hits the Crescent of Light. It glints on his
lifeless throat. Gently, he closes Kip's glassy eyes.

sound behind him. Will hurls himself aside, grabbing for a weapon. He looks
up -it's the Lookout, battle-stained and weary. Their eyes meet -

LOOKOUT

(quietly)

You said we'd win.

Will just nods - he knows.

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

You gave us hope - that was the cruelest thing.

The Lookout kneels and crosses Kip's hands across his chest. He reaches
down and removes the Crescent of Light. He turns to Will -

LOOKOUT (CONT'D)

Get the weapons you need. The apes'Il be coming back for their dead. Hurry!

Will arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

rise into the sky - the eagle's nest is on fire. Drak and his apes make
their way along a narrow mountain trail - they've put the humans' camp to
the torch.

With them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly, many of
them in tears. They carry long poles over which are slung their dead and
dying. We crane, up to -

HUGE ROCK OVERHANG

high up the mountain-side. Standing underneath it, hidden in shadow, are
Diamond and Strider. They look down on the mountain trail. Diamond sees
Eve.

THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL

The young girl stumbles along the road, tied by a length of chain to Drak's
saddle. She's bruised and bleeding, her ankles shackled, barely able to
walk.

THE ROCK OVERHANG

Diamond looks at her, close to tears, but there's nothing she can do. She
watches the convoy wind along the trail.

Boomi The fire must have hit a store of gunpowder - an explosion rips
through the eagle's nest, blowing out the side of one of the peaks. Diamond
watches the dust climb into the sky. All her hopes seem to be going with
it.

IN THE RIVER

It's twilight. Will and the Lookout are wading around a knob of land that
protects one end of a tiny beach.

Will sees a fire burning on the sand, a cave opening off the beach, piles
of stones like burial mounds.

WILL

What is this place?

LOOKOUT

It's called the Crossroads of the Fallen King - it's where our forefathers
are laid to rest. It's sacred to us - anyone who's still alive will make
their way here.

They wade closer to the beach. In the firelight they see groups of
tribesmen -survivors of the battle. Women and children - the lucky few who
managed to flee the eagle's nest - are binding the warriors' wounds.

They look up - everyone falls silent at the sight of Will. As he comes
closer he recognizes a woman, sitting alone -

WILL

It's Kip's wife. She's come from

THE EAGLE'S NEST -

He goes towards her, passing the other tribes-people. Nobody greets him.
They just watch him pass. He stops in front of Kip's wife. Her eyes are red
from crying.

WILL

rm sorry about your mate.

She says nothing - she just stares at him. Will keeps going -

WILL (CONT'D)

I've been to the eagle's nest. I was looking for the woman I was with. We
searched but...

(he pauses)

What happened - was she captured?

KIP'S WIFE

I threw myself off a platform. I don't know what happened to anyone.

Will nods. He gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire. We
don't hear what he says, but we know what he is asking. One after another
they shake their heads - no, they know nothing of Diamond.

SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT

shimmers on the water. Will sits on a rock that straggles into the water.
His face is grim, his heart heavy with grief. He's making something with
his hands - twisting and turning them - but in the dim light we can't see
what it is.

INSIDE THE CAVE

A shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their
end - it's like Stonehenge. The surviving tribes-people are gathered in
their shadow.

OLD MAN

It's half a day since the battle. Any that survived would be here by now -
we are all that remains of the Seven Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the
field. We must decide ourselves what to do.

Silence for a moment. They have spent too long following a leader for
discussion to come easily. Finally, a wounded warrior speaks -

WOUNDED WARRIOR

Like you say, Kip is dead. Maybe it's a sign -the Rangers have left Middle
Earth forever. Perhaps it's telling us to do the same.

A young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head.

YOUNG WOMAN

Leave the valley? This is where the eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody
can live without their totem - we all know that!

LOOKOUT

Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here, we die. But if we
travel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we've got a chance. Who knows - maybe
our totems will follow us?

There's a murmur of agreement. It grows louder, tribes-people nodding their
heads.

THE BEACH

Now we see what Will has been making - it's a boat made out of twigs and
leaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast. He leans forward and drops it
in the water. He watches the current carry it away. Farther and farther it
bobs out into the river -

WILL

(softly)

I'm sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it wasn't our war. All you
wanted was a baby...

He can't go on. He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land.

IN THE RIVER

The current carries the boat past a jagged boulder. An ape's hand reaches
out and picks it up. He lifts it up to look more closely. We see his face -
it's Strider. He turns the toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically.
He hands it to Diamond, wading along behind him -

STRIDER

It looks like someone made it.

DIAMOND

It's a boat - it's gaff-rigged.

(realizing)

Oh, Jesus...

She plunges forward, wading as fast as she can.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Will!

ON THE BEACH

Will is walking up the beach. He stops, listening. He hears it again -his
name! He turns and heads towards the river. He sees Diamond coming round
the headland, splashing through the water.

Will stops. They look at one another - then they both move forward, arms
stretching out. They wrap their arms around each other.

WILL

(softly)

I thought I'd lost you.

DIAMOND

I thought you were dead.

They keep holding each other.

WILL

How did you find this place?

DIAMOND

Strider. His father was a tracker. We've been following a trail for hours.

Will looks over her shoulder - Strider is wading towards them.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

He saved my life, Will.

Will goes to greet him. The man and the ape embrace.

WILL

Thank you, my friend - thank you.

STRIDER

What did you expect? You would have done the same for me.

SHOWER OF SPARKS

as Will puts a log on the fire. From inside the cave we hear the murmur of
voices as the argument goes back and forth.

Both Diamond and Strider are wrapped in furs - their clothes are laid out
next to the fire, drying. Will speaks to Diamond -

WILL

Some times when we want something so bad, we can take a thing and twist it
in our head. You're sure about this, Billie?

DIAMOND

I'm pregnant, Will - I'm not crazy. She's not like them - she's a mutation.
Evolution's always trying to improve on itself. It's turned out a child
that can walk taller and run faster, one whose brain-pan holds a mind that
can think laterally. I've seen her, Will. I've held her in my arms - she
was us.

Will looks at her. There's no doubt - he believes her.

WILL

You said she was with Drak.

DIAMOND

On a chain.

WILL

It's two days' march to the city. Was she wounded - can she make it?

DIAMOND

She can make it.

(a beat - she looks at him)

Will?

Before he can answer, the Old Man and several others come down the beach -

OLD MAN

It's decided - we're leaving the valley forever.

(turns to Strider)

Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken.
Long may their spirits haunt you

(he turns back to Will)

You and your mate can travel with u but we've got misery enough to carry.
Our hearth is not home to ny ape.

WILL

Then it's not home to us. The ape's better than any man I've known.

The Old Man's lip curls in a sneer. He shrugs and walks away.

STRIDER

Go with them. Will - everyone needs their own kind.

Will and Diamond newer almost simultaneously -

WILL

No!

DIAMOND

Of course we can't...

(to Will)

The city, Will.

Will and Strider turn nd look at her - incredulous.

WILL

We call it a city - it's more like a fortress, Billie. It can't be done.

DIAMOND

The three of you got out - everyone thought that was impossible too.

WILL

We were lucky. But that's the trouble with luck - it runs out. I don't want
to be back in the city when it does.

DIAMOND

What about Eve - what do we do, just forget about her?

WILL

No. Maybe we can't stop the apes giving her the disease - but they'll have
to turn her loose. That's the only way she can infect others. So we lay a
plan and we find her. Then it's our job to stop her having children. If we
can do that, it can't be passed on through the race.

She shrugs That's the only thing I can think of.

DIAMOND

How long will that take - less than twenty-five days ?

WILL

No.

DIAMOND So what of my child?

We have to face it - you're going to lose it.

She turns away, trying to keep her emotions in check. Will comes to her
side -

WILL (CONT'D)

We can't take our eye off the goal. If we solve this, you can have other
children. Not if wa throw our lives away, though.

DIAMOND

Whose, Will - whose children?

She looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.

WILL

guess that's your call.

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us
great. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?
What would you do if it was your child?

She looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -

WILL

I don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to
getting into the city. I just don't know...

He picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

It sits on a river. There's only one bridge -heavily guarded. Even if we
could cross it, all the ridges and roads are patrolled -

STRIDER

There's one place that's not.

Both Diamond and Will turn to him. He takes the stick -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Down here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.
From there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to
cross the river.

He draws an arrow across the water, illustrating the problem. Diamond is
about to speak but she looks at Will - he's staring at the arrow, an idea,
half formed, is starting to form.

WILL

Maybe there is a way...across the river, I mean.

DIAMOND

How?

Will turns to her -

WILL

You'll love it - there's barely any science to it at all.

DIAMOND

We're going? Is that right - we're going!?

Their eyes meet and hold. He smiles at her.

THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and
Strider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney.

STRIDER

They've started up the furnace.

(softly)

Let the games begin.

DIAMOND

What games?

WILL

The apes kill their prisoners for sport. The furnace takes care of the
bodies.

Diamond - sickened by it - turns to look at Will. Already he's heading off,
leading them down nrrow trail.

A HIDDEN LEDGE

much closer to the city. Will and the others move fast along it, deep in
the shadows. The river thunders by below them, separating them from the
city. The only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge. Ape guards
patrol it.

Only Diamond pauses to look et it. Will and Strider urge her forward. It
disappears from view.

A STEEL ARROW

flies through the air. Tied to its shaft, trailing out behind, is a rope
made from vines. Will lowers a crossbow. He watches the arrow fly through
the mist and spray -

THE RIVER

races by just below and pours over the Falls of No Return. Whack! The arrow
buries itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank.

ON THE OTHER SHORE

Will and Strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree. It stretches
from one side of the river to the other. All it has to do is hold. Will
turns to Diamond. He shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls -

WILL

You first. We'll be right behind.

Diamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope. She
looks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind-blown spray;
the roaring water rushes by; the rope hangs like a thread. There's fear on
her face -

WILL (CONT'D)

You ready?

DIAMOND

It sure as shit ain't Kansas, is it?

WILL

Go!

Diamond throws herself forward. Her feet leave the platform. Hand over hand
she goes - out across the river.

Will watchel for a moment then launches himself - his hands wrap around the
rope.

Strider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps. The line bows
under his weight. Diamond'l feet drop closer to the water. She looks down -
the mass of black water, flecked with foam, rushes past.

Will looks ahead - Diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray. She's
dripping wet, hauling herself forward -

The sound of the Falls is deafening. Right below her, a huge, swirling
"hole" opens up. It's a whirlpool. She starts to swing across it. Joltl

THE TREE TRUNK

The arrow pulls part way out of the tree. The steel shaft shivers but it
holds. Everything seems okay. Suddenly -

Snap! One of the strands of the vine breaks -

ON THE ROPE

Everything bucks and shudders. Diamond screams. She looks down - straight
into the vortex of the whirlpool. Her blood runs cold - she freezes.

WILL SEES HER HANGING MOTIONLESS ON THE ROPE. HE SCREAMS AT HER -

WILL

Go! Billie - go!

She doesn't seem to hear. Her eyes are wide with fear - staring down, down
into the whirlpool's bottomless well.

WILL, TRYING TO GET TO HER, HURLS HIMSELF FORWARD. THE ROPE STRAINS AND
BOWS -

WILL

Move!

She doesn't react. Strider watches as Will tries to catch up. The rope is
swaying so much it's agonizingly slow.

Diamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness. The whirlpool
seems to be swallowing everything, even the moonlight -

WILL (CONT'D)

Billiai What about the baby?!

The word hits her. She pulls her eyes from the swirling death. She looks at
Will.

WILL (CONT'D)

Move, Billiel Nowl

She understands. She starts to pull herself forward. Will slumps with
relief -

ON THE SHORE

The arrow moves another inch out of the trunk. The rope fixed to its shaft
is strained to breaking point. But still everything holds...

THE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

One of the guards patrols the bridge. Out of the corner of his eye - flash
of something. He looks towards the Falls.

GUARD

(calling)

Gimla.

The other guard joins him. They peer through the night at the spray rising
from the Falls. They see it again - above the river, a flash of light on
metal.

The keep watching. An eddy of wind clears the mist for a second. They see
Strider going hand over hand along the rope, moonlight glinting on his
crossbow.

ON THE SHORE

Another strand of the rope breaks. We follow it as it unravels - past
Diamond and Will. Before we get to Strider it stops - a section of the rope
is so badly frayed it can't go any farther. It's going to break any moment.

Screech! A siren wails.

STRIDER

They've seen usl Will looks up-river to the bridge. Through a hole in the
mist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling. A whole squadron runs to join
them.

Diamond throws herself forward - she makes the shorel

Will and Strider give it everything they've got. Strider's first hand
passes the frayed section. He's following it with his second -

Snap! The whole rope breaks. Will - closest to the shore - plunges into the
ripping current. But at leaIt he's clinging to the rope with both hands.
Strider's in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of
one paw. Will turns and reaches for him.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

No! Save yourselfl

ON THE SHORE

Diamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in. The
weight - of the men and the current - make it impossible. All she can do is
try and hold them.

ON THE ROPE

Strider's fingers are slipping free. Will grabs him - man and ape, hand to
paw. Will holds him.

STRIDER

We'll both die. Let gol Will shakes his head - no. Hanging on to the rope
one-handed, the current tearing at his body, he tries to haul Strider in.

Whizz! An arrow flies past, just missing them, and plunges into the water.
The apes on the bridge are firing.

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Another minute, we'll both be dead. Do it, Willl

Will tries again to drag Strider to the rope. Another arrow flies through
the mist and spray - even closer. Strider reaches out with his free hand.
He starts to prize Will's fingers loose -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

If nothing else, I made it to the Falls No Return.

Will realizes - nothing is going to stop Strider.

WILL

The sacred words, Strider - what are the words?!

STRIDER

"In the beginning...

WILL

'In the beginning was the word and the word wes God...'

STRIDER

(in wonder)

You know the words?

WILL

You'll walk in the next world, Strider.

STRIDER

How do you know?

WILL

I've seen the future, haven't I?

Strider smiles at him - a smile of perfect peace.

STRIDER

Good-bye Will. Take care of Billie.

He twists Will's last finger free. He drops - the swirling river carries
him away. Will is close to tears, but he won't let himself cry. Two more
arrows sizzle past -

WILL

And the word was God. Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I
will fear no evil...

Strider spins down the river, through the spray and foam.

WILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.

Strider, one arm raised, plunges over the Falls.

ON THE BRIDGE

We see who's been coordinating the firing. It's Drak. Archers are kneeling
on the bridge, trying to sight a target through the foaming water and
clouds of mist.

Drak, never taking his eyes off of the river, draws back the massive spring
of his crossbow and reloads.

ON THE SHORE

Diamond ia hauling on the rope, pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in
water, tows himself along it. His feet find a footing - he starts to
scramble up the bank. Diamond goes towards him -

Just for a moment, the mist clears.

ON THE BRIDGE

moment's long enough. Drak's seen him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his
aim and fires -

ON THE SHORE

Diamond is almost in Will's arms. Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU's back,
through his ribs. He pitches forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her
arms.

The mist closes around them.

HUGE STONE ARCH

The survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail. All of
them are burdened down with possessions, weary from the road - they are
leaving the valley.

Kip's Wife and the Old Man are in the lead. They pass through the arch, out
into a clearing. In the middle of it is a fire, shadows camped around it -

Kip's wife and the other survivors stop in fear. One of the shadows rises
from the. fire. Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards
them. It's Aragorn!

Kip's wife moves forward and embraces him -

KIP'S WIFE

We thought you were dead.

ARAGORN

Hunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -

He indicates his men. They are coming forward, greeting the survivors. The
Young Woman sees her mate - she cries out. They hold each other.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

For three days a squadron of apes have tracked us. Last night we ambushed
them. We're heading now for the eagle's nest.

KIP'S WIFE

(softly)

There is no eagle's nest.

Aragorn stares at her, not wanting to believe it.

KIP'S WIFE (CONT'D)

We're all that's left of the Seven Tribes.

Grief wells up inside Aragorn. We hold on his face.

A FIRE CRACKLES

All of the tribes-people are gathered around it.

OLD MAN

There is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the Ranger.

ARAGORN

(shaking his head)

No. We must all follow the trail we think best. You've decided yours. For
me * I'll go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can. I'll go
alone - but like the traveler, I think death will be the only thing I find
there.

OLD MAN

Then it will find us, too. Warriors follow their Ranger. That's always been
the way of it in Middle Earth.

ARAGORN

But nothing's the same now. Think of the women-folk. What will become of
them?

KIP'S WIFE

You're right - there's so few of us now, nothing is the same. You must
allow the women to follow, too.

ARAGORN But women can't fight.

KIP'S WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight. That doesn't mean they
can't.

All the women nod their assent. The men smile, agreeing. Everyone waits for
Aragorn to decide. A beat - then he nods his head and smiles.

The tribes-people start to cheer. The Lookout steps forward. From out of
the folds of his fur, he takes the Crescent of Light. All of the tribe
stare at it.

LOOKOUT

I found it on the battlefield. There were those who said the Rangers had
left Middle Earth forever - I didn't know what to do with it.

He hands it to Aragorn. The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again
ties the talisman of his rank around his neck.

ARAGORN

Douse the fire. The Seven Tribes are going to war.

ON THE SHORE

The apes, carrying torches, search the river bank and surrounding cliffs.
We push in on a pool of darkness behind them -

Will and Diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree.
They have done their best to dress Will's wound but he's obviously in a lot
of pain -

DIAMOND

You can't go on, Will - not like this.

WILL

What about the baby?

DIAMOND

I'll keep going - I'll try and get Eve.

WILL

Alone? Don't be ridiculous -

He starts to haul himself to his feet. His face twists in pain - he has to
stop.

DIAMOND

Look at you - you can barely walk.

He puts out his hand, needing I boost up.

WILL

If I can just get up - help me.

Diamond shakes her head - no. They look at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

Don't do this to me - pleasel

DIAMOND

You've done enough - more than anyone else could. You're one of the finest
men

I've ever known - but it's over, Will. You're going to have to wait. Now
it's my turn -

She grabs her weapons and starts to leave. Will makes it to his feet -

WILL

Billie!She's almost through the tangled roots.

WILL (CONT'D)

I made a mistake once - I went on a journey with someone I loved. At the
end, I let her go into danger alone.

Diamond stops.

DIAMOND

Where was that - Berkeley, Will?

She turns and looks at him. He nods his head - yes.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

What happened?

WILL

I knew I'd found the chemical key. I was working with three young
researchers. One of them was a woman called Ali Conoily. We were engaged.
They were the ones that went into the tanks. I didn't know as much as I
thought I did. They died in there.

DIAMOND

Why didn't you go, Will?

WILL

We all wanted to. It was a great adventure. Wa drew lots for it. I should
never have agreed, but we were young - and like the young we thought life
would last forever.

DIAMOND

Robert Plant died too, didn't he - in a way?

WILL

The experiment was unauthorized. There was an inquiry. They said the theory
had no basis. 'Ludicrous" was a word they used. My career had gone up like
a rocket. It came down like the stick. I couldn't find work anywhere

DIAMOND

"Will Robinson" - that was your joke, I guess. You were Lost in Space, were
you?

WILL

Yeah, but I never realized it'd be so appropriate.

They sort of smile at one another.

WILL (CONT'D)

had twenty years to work out where my research went wrong - so what,
though. It was just a mind game. But I've learnt a lot of things - the most
important is that sometimes you get a second chance. A second chance for a
lot of things -

He looks straight at her. They hold each other's eyes.

WILL (CONT'D)

And when you do, you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go.
I've got the heart, Billie. It's my body that's failing me.

Neither one of them moves. A beat.

DIAMOND

Give me your hand, Will.

She helps him to his feet.

A GIANT CHASM

It's several hours before dawn. In the gloom - whooshl Kip's Wife rides a
flying fox across a precipitous drop.

She lands on the other side of a jagged ravine. The rest of the tribe, all
heavily armed, are waiting there. They turn end run, fading into the trees.

THE FUNERAL ROCK

juts out into the roaring river. Will and Diamond scramble out of the
darkness and land on the rock. Will's face is haggard with pain but he
forces himself forward. He's loosening up. going faster as he moves -

They pass through the huge legs of the stone ape - into the Temple.

A DARKENED ROOM

Torches flicker on the walls. From somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear
the sound of a crowd. A young ape, barely in his teens, stands in the
middle of the room, almost naked. His face is painted with strange ochre
markings.

A circle of ape warriors watch as Ma-Gog lifts a slender blade. Intoning
words in some strange tongue, he slices the blade across the Teenager's
forehead. The Teenager winces but he doesn't cry out - this is his manhood
ceremony.

THE STABLES

The sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we don't see them. The
prisoners from the Eagle's Nest are crowded into the corrals.

One of the gates is thrown open. Three ape guards enter. They push the
tribes-people aside and grab a 12-year old boy. His mother clings to him,
screaming. One of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the
corral.

AN ARENA

-like a small bullring - in the center of the stables. Now we see the crowd
- apes, all males, sit in the bleachers. They roar as a door is opened and
the young Tribe-Boy is pushed into the ring.

He looks around the arena - yelling, screaming apes. Terror on his face. An
even louder roar goes up. The Boy turns -

The Teenage ape steps out of a tunnel, the ochre markings on his face like
war-paint, the blood barely dried on his forehead. He carries spears and a
club.

One of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the Boy.
The Teenage ape moves in on him. He is a warrior now - this is going to be
his first kill.

IN THE CORRAL

The Boy's mother is huddled down, being comforted by other tribes-people. A
huge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck. The sound
carries over to -

A TERRACE

Drak is alone, walking a high ridge. He stops, looking down on the
twinkling lights. The city is virtually deserted but Drak doesn't move -
he's uneasy, troubled by something he can't put a name to.

THE COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

The five baby apes sit on cots. They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe
into the smallest ape's arm. The baby starts to cry. Doctor Zora comforts
her as she draws out a cup of blood. She turns to her assistant, Ben-Guri

DOCTOR ZORA

Is the girl animal ready?

BEN-GURI

They're doing it now.

INSIDE THE LABORATORY

Eve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an
operating table. He and another guard start to strap her down.

The Vet works at the bench, heating a steel needle over a flame. It's the
same sort of catheter that was used on Will - one end of the needle
attached to a long tube. A knock on the door.

VET

That must be Zors with the blood.

One of the guards goes and unbolts the door. He recoils - it's Will.
Sswhack! He fires the first bolt from a double-barreled crossbow. It takes
the guard in the chest.

He and Diamond dive into the room. Eve starts hollering. The second guard
is wheeling, crossbow rising. He rifle-butts Diamond across the head. Her
weapon goes flying.

The guard is aiming. Will is on the floor, tumbling. Barely time to aim, on
his back, firing overhead, he shoots -

Whack! Bullseye. The arrow hits the guard dead in the heed.

The Vet grabs the first guard's fallen crossbow. He aims at Will. Diamond
screams a warning but there's nothing Will can do - he's struggling to
reload, one-handed because of his wounds.

Diamond - unarmed - scoops the red-hot syringe off the bench. The Vet
reaches for the trigger. Diamond leaps forward. She drives the syringe into
his chest.

The Vet stands goggle-eyed. Diamond must have found his heart - a torrent
of blood pours down the clear tube. It spills on to the floor. The Vet
topples forward.

Slash! Slash! Will cuts throughthe straps that tie Eve to the table.

OUTSIDE THE HALL OF LEARNING

Drak turns a corner of the building. He stops and touches the ground with
his finger. He lifts it to his mouth and tastes it. He rises to his feet,
following trail of blood.

A TORCH

is ripped from a bracket. It's Drak.. He shines it down into a stone well.
The flame splits the darkness. Floating in the water at the bottom of the
well is an ape guard -dead, an arrow through his throat.

IN THE ARENA

The Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust, bleeding badly from a rip across his
ribs. His spear lies next to him, a wooden shield raised across his head.
The Teenage ape , rains blows down on it with a sword.

The apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly. Smash! The shield splinters.
The sword slices the Boy's arm -

APES

Kill! Kill! Kill!

The Boy stares up - the Teenage smiles and raises his sword.

Shriek! The alarm sounds. Everything freezes. Then officers are on their
feet, yelling orders. Ape soldiers grab their weapons, heading for the
doors.

The Teenage ape looks around, robbed of his moment. The Boy sees his
chance. He raises his spear and drives it deep into the ape's groin. He
staggers and falls - on top of the Boy.

The apes pour out of the arena. The siren carries over to -

A STONE CORRIDOR

Will's got Eve slung over his shoulder. They're stumbling down a corridor -
past other labs and research rooms. They burst through a sat of doors, into
-

A COURTYARD

at the back of the Hall of Learning. It's deep in shadow. From behind they
hear the sound of pounding feet. Will looks around, not sure which way to
go. He glances across a terrace - the doors to the stables fly open. The
ape warriors charge out.

WILL

Can you ride?

Diamond nods her head - yes. He thrusts Eve into her hands -

WILL (CONT'D)

Go for the stables. Head for the eagle's nest. I'll try to join you there.

Diamond hesitates - she doesn't want to leave him.

DIAMOND

What are you going to do?

WILL

Delay them. Now go, Billie. Go!

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

rops down the side of the ravine. Standing on it are Nazgul and about

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

a dozen Praetorian Guards. Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums
are lighting up the streets and terraces. Ape soldiers are running
everywhere - searching.

ON THE GROUND

The flame-thrower rolls along a street. The driver's canopy is hidden by
flapping tarpaulins. In the chaos nobody pays it any attention.

ON THE ELEVATOR

Nazgul sees the machine rolling towards them.

NAZGUL

That's strange - why does Drak need the Flame?

Suddenly he realizel. He turns, screaming up at the apes controlling the
mechanism.

NAZGUL (CONT'D)

Stopl Take it backl

THE FLAME-THROWER

dead guard is draped over the side of the machine, blood dripping from his
headWill is in the cabin, working the controls. He sees the elevator slow
in mid-descent. He throws a lever forward. For a moment, nothing. Then -

Whoosh! A huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel.

Two of the guards are trying to climb the ropes. Nazgul is wheeling around
in a panic. The flame hits them! The whole wooden structure catches fire.
We see the apes through the flames, struggling and writhing.

The ropes burn through. The blazing structure plummets down -

THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Smash! It hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes. Ape
soldiers - standing nearby - stare in shock. The smell of roasted ape fills
the air.

EVE SITS ALONE

She's on the floor of the stables, deep in shadow. She's scared, looking
ahead -

The first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors. We see an ape
guard, keys jangling from his waist, on petrol.

He hears something - a rock falling, a rustle of movement. Raising his
weapon, he moves towards a pool of black shadow, past a pile of rocks, into
an alcove.

Diamond rises out of the rocks behind him. He spins - she's got her
cross-bow raised. Point-blank range. She nails him.

THE PRISONERS

are shackled in the corrals. They see Diamond running out of the shadows
towards them. She tossel them the keys -

DIAMOND

Arm yourselves. Find Will - he needs youl She turns and goes. The prisoners
start to unlock the chains.

EVE

smiles as Diamond races out of the shadows, sweeps her up and keeps
running.

IN THE ARENA

The Teenage ape and the Boy lie where they fell, their spilt blood staining
the dust.

The Boy's mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son.
She drags off the ape. Her son's eyes are closed, his arms lacerated, his
chest wounded and crusted with blood. She stares at him - he doesn't move.

She starts to sob. The Boy's eyes flicker open. They look at one another.
The motheY gathers him into her arms. He's alive! He's alive!

The sound of a horse. The mother turns, fearful. She looks across the
arena, through a railing -

IN THE CORRALS

Diamond gallops a stallion through the corrals. Eve's clutching the saddle
in front of her - hair flying, her eyes sparkling with exhilaration. The
stallion gallops faster.

The prisoners - unchaining the last of their comrades - turn and look. It's
a magnificent sight. Diamond is crouched Iow over the flying horse.
Straight ahead - a railed fence, part of the corral.

She leaps the horse over it. They land. In front - another hurdle. Again
she does it.

The prisoners stare. Diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND FLAME

The crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire. Ape city is
burning.

The Flame stands on a steep incline, its back wedged against the wall of a
terrace. Whooshl Fire shoots out of its barrel as Will keeps a horde of ape
soldiers at bay.

The soldiers turn - Drak, surrounded by the Praetorian Guard, gallops
straight towards them. He'l not stopping for anything - the soldiers
scramble aside.

IN THE CABIN

Will sees Drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke.
They look like the horsemen of the apocalypse. As Will throws the lever we
sea a primitive gauge above his head. It's in the red -

IN THE SQUARE

Whoosh! The tongue of flame shoots through the smoke. It touches the guards
with a deadly kiss, throwing them screaming from their horses. But Drak
blasts through -

IN THE CABIN

Will is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke. He peers through it -
Drak charges towards him! Will hits the lever again. The flame erupts from
the barrel. Then it dies - out of fuel.

WILL

Shit!

IN THE SQUARE

Drak gallops forward. He raises weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon. He
aims -

IN THE CABIN

Will throws himself aside. He smashes both hands down on a lever on the
floor. A hiss of steam. The machine lurches forward -

IN THE SQUARE

Drak tries to get a clear shot at Will. The machine gathers speed down the
incline, coming straight towards Drak. He veers his horse aside and wheels
around. He charges alongside the cabin - it's empty

ON THE MACHINE

Will clings to the outside of the Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled
square. He's out of sight of Drak - but not for long. The ape and his
stallion loom into view behind the machine, Will scrambles back into the
cabin -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square. Drak is
at full gallop, veering from one side of the Flame to the other. Will
clambers back and forth - cat and mouse at full tilt.

Drak swings his horse close to the back of the machine. He stands up in the
stirrups, the harpoon clamped to his shoulder - he's going on board!

The Flame flies out of the square and down a street. An ape throws himself
into a doorway - just in time, Drak steadies himself, about to jump.
Suddenly his horse whinnies wildly. Drak looks ahead - holy shit!. They're
heading straight for the front of a blazing house.

Drak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins. Will hurls
himself back into the cabin, arms shielding his head. Smash! The Flame
crashes through the front wall -

INSIDE THE HOUSE

The barrel of the Flame acts like a battering ram - it blasts through the
walls in a shower of burning timbers. It crashes through the kitchen and
stops in a courtyard.

Will clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground. A yell goes up -
apes are coming through the adjoining houses. Will turns and heads down an
alleyway.

CITY STREET

Diamond's horse flies down a street - a high terrace towers on one side, a
row of burning buildings on the other. The road turns right. She swings
around it - apes! A platoon of them right in front of her. She screams at
Eve -

DIAMOND

Hold on!

She throws herself aside, pulling on the reins. The horse spins in a
U-turn, grazing past a burning building. Diamond gallops back the way she
came.

Crash! The wall of a burning building in front of her collapses. Blazing
beams block the road. The horse shies away. Diamond wheels him around -

The apes race into the road. She looks around desperately - she's trapped.
She grabs Eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her - she'll be safer
there.

She spurs the horse forward and crouches Iow in the saddle - she's going to
charge straight through the apes. They drop to one knee - the firing
position - and raise their weapons. A dozen crossbowl aim straight at
Diamond.

There's no way out - she flies towards them. Whizzl The sound of arrows.
But it's not the apes - they go down like nine-pins.

Diamond looks up - Aragorn has arrived! Backlit by the rising sun, the men
and women of the Tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes.
Nobody fires better than Kip's Wife.

Diamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the
road.

MA-GOG

stands on a terrace, his cloak blowing in the wind, his one cruel eye
blazing with anger. Flanked by two ape warriors, he looks down on the
burning buildings.

The freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables.

Ma-Gog sees Will - he's running along the rooftops, leaping from one
building to the next. Ma-Gog points at him, yelling at apes in the streets
below -

MA-GOG (CONT'D)

Kill him! In the name of God, kill himl Sswhish! The blade of a sword
cleaves through frame. It cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist.
Ma-Gog spins - it's Aragorn, armed to the teeth, behind them.

The second warrior goes for him. Aragorn has dropped the sword. He raises a
crossbow and fires. The bolt shatters the ape's armor and buries itself in
his chest.

Ma-Gog swirls aside his cloak. In his good hand he holds a double-edged
sword. Aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath Ma-Gog's arcing blow.
He lunges with a short-handled spear -

ARAGORN

For my people!

It takes Ma-Gog in the gut. His one eye bulges. Aragorn rips the spear out
-

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

And this - for my daughterl He drives the spear into the High Priest's
heart. The cruel eye flickers and dies.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will has seen it all. He screams -

WILL

Behind you! Aragorn - behind!

ON THE TERRACE

Aragorn turns. It's Drak, on horseback, thundering down on him. But the
leader of the Seven Tribes knows no fear - only the memory of his lost
child.

He raises his second spear and charges straight at Drak. The huge ape
levels the shoulder-mounted harpoon. He pulls the trigger. Sswang! The
powerful spring on the barrel releases, the harpoon trails a length of rope
behind it -

Wham! The harpoon smashes through Aragorn's chest. He dies as he falls.

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will stares in anguish. He turns away - he sees Diamond. She's at full
gallop - Eve clinging to her back - charging along a road several terraces
below. She's got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom.

Will looks across at Drak - he's seen her too! For a moment the two of them
stare at one another. Will's face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he
carries.

Drak's lip curls in a sneer - he knows he's going to win. He beats his
chest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace,
going for Diamond.

Will runs as fast as his body will let him - along the rooftop.

INSIDE A HOUSE

An ape mother cowers in a corner, her two children clutched to her, the
sounds of battle all around. She looks up in terror -

Smash! Will's feet blast through the roof. He lands on the floor, crossbow
raised -but not st her. Framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on
horseback. Wham! Will shoots him and runs for the horse.

DIAMOND

and Eve fly down charred street .They head towards a large open square.

OUTSIDE THE STABLES

Smoke and dust swirl through the air. The freed prisoners are fighting ape
infantry. Drak races past the battle. The rope from the harpoon is tied
around the saddle, dragging Aragorn's body through the dust.

He looks ahead - Diamond gallops across the square. Drak whips his horse
forward -

A CURVED ROAD

on a high terrace. Flying around a corner - Will! His coat is billowing,
the horse's mane streaming in the wind. He hits the straight-away and
gallops even faster.

He looks down on the road below - Diamond is ahead but Drak is gaining on
her. Will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock.

ON THE ROAD

Eve clings tight to Diamond's waist. The little girl looks back - Drak is
thundering behind them, pennants snapping in the wind, armor glinting on
the horse's chest. It's an awesome sight.

Drak has the reins in his teeth. He's using both hands to reload the
harpoon.

Diamond sees the bridge dead ahead. Heavily armed apes have barricaded it.
She curses and yanks the bridle. The horse sweeps around an island in the
center of the road - a huge monument to some dead ape. She gallops back the
way she came, almost passing Drak. He charges round the island.

OUT OF THE TUNNEL

comes Will. He looks down to the lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming
back towards him! He turns the horse around - back into the tunnel.

Whooshl He flies out the other end, into daylight. He looks over his
shoulder - he's in front of them but thirty feet too high. He digs his
heels into the horse's flanks -over a Iow wall they fly. God knows where it
goes -

DOWN A ROCKY SUDE

into a dead-end cul-de-sac just above the roadway. Apesi Two of them are
guarding the Claw and the Bells. Will fires from the shoulder - he drops
the first ape.

The second ape aims at him. Will raises another crossbow. They fire almost
simultaneously. Will throws himself aside, out of the saddle. The horse
rears and bolts.

Will looks up from the dirt - the ape has Will's arrow embedded in his
chest. He falls forward - dead.

Will scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below. Diamond
and Eve - clinging to the horse for dear life - race towards him. Will
grabs a crossbow and struggles to reload. He can't - it takes the strength
of both arms to cock it,

ON THE ROAD

Diamond's horse is lathered in sweat, almost blown. Eve looks over her
shoulder, her eyes wide with fear - Drak is close behind, gaining at every
step.

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC

Will leaps from the Balls on to the Claw.

ON THE ROAD

Drak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder. He sights down the barrel. Eve
sees the weapon lock on to their backs. She screams a warning et Diamond -

EVE

Billie!

Diamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road. Drak
loses her in his sights. He follows her over the wagon.

ON THE CLAW

Will is in the driver's seat. He throws a lever - nothing happens. He tries
another -the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the
road.

DRAK

aims the harpoon. He's got Eve end Diamond, one behind the other, in his
sights.

DRAK

A bargain - two for the price of onel

ON THE CLAW

Will spins a small steering wheel.

ON THE ROAD

Drak is close behind Diamond. The harpoon's massive spring is coiled.
Drak's finger curls around the trigger, about to fire.

Suddenly he screams - dropping right in front, coming straight towards him,
are the opening jaws of the Claw.

WILL JERKS BACK ANOTHER LEVER -

WILL

Keep your hands off her, you dirty ape.

The jaws lock clean around Drak's waist, plucking him off the saddle and
lifting him up into the air. He's still got the harpoon. He sees Will at
the control. He swings the barrel round -

Will hits a switch. Wrong one - nothing happens.

Drak's got him in his sights. His finger finds the trigger -

Will throws another switch.

The jaws start to close! Drak tries to pull the trigger - he can't, his
body is twisting. The jaws are crushing him! He musters all of his strength
and tries to fire. He and Will look straight at one another. A beat. Drsk's
finger starts to slide off the trigger -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes stare up at their warrior lord, clamped in the Clew. He let out a
blood curdling scream. The bottom half of his torso - everything from the
waist down - falls towards the ground. Maybe it's just the wind, but the
legs still seem to be kicking.

The apes reel beck in horror. With mighty battle cry, the tribes-people -
the prisoners end Aregom'l followers - hurl themselves forward, attacking.

The apes break end start to run.

ON THE ROAD

Diamond end Eve have dismounted. Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming
towards her. She holds out her arms and they embrace. Neither one says a
word, they just hold each other tight.

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

almost obscure the setting sun. Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge
watching the tribes-people. They've harnessed horses to ropes tied around
the statues on the avenue of idols - one after another the stone monoliths
come crashing down.

DIAMOND

If nothing else, we helped the tribes take back their valley.

WILL

Our valley, too Billia.

She looks at him - questioning.

WILL (CONT'D)

There's one thing I never told you - I never worked out how to get back.

She smiles at him.

DIAMOND

A small point. But give me some credit. I'm a scientist - I knew that.

WILL

(in wonder)

But you came anyway.

DIAMOND

That was love.

WILL

For the baby?

She shakes her head.

DIAMOND

For the both of you.

They stare into each other's eyes. They kiss.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)
I only have one regret. We'll never know if we succeeded.

WILL
Of course we will. You're pregnant - if the baby's born alive, we'll know
it worked.

SUNLIGHT GLISTENS ON THE OCEAN

The surf rolls in on a golden beach. At the water's edge, a line of
footprints. We follow them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff. He's
building something out of iron and rock and sand but we can't make out what
it is.

DIAMOND (O.S.)
Will 

He turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave.

INSIDE THE CAVE

Diamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins. Her belly is exposed,
heaw with the unborn child. Eve crouches next to her, trying to help.

WILL
It's started?

She nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts.

THE SUN IS SETTING ON THE SEA

From inside the cave, we hear Diamond scream.

IN THE CAVE

Will kneels between Diamond's legs. Her face, glistening with sweat; is a
mask of pain. She holdl Eve's hind tight and pushes.

Will, half hidden by her upraised legs, delivers the child. Diamond raises
herself up -trying to See her child. Neither she nor us can see it's face.

We push in on Will. Ha raises his hand and slaps the baby's rump. No sound.
Ha raises his hand again - suddenly the baby starts to cry. Now we see the
baby - a perfect little boy.

Eve laughs. Diamond smiles. Tears fill her eyes. She and Will look at one
another. He comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms.

THE CAVE

Will and Eve help Diamond. She comes out of the cave, still holding the
baby. It's magic hour - they stand on a rock ledge, looking at the ocean
washed with color from the setting sun.

We see what Will was building. It's sort of like a sculpture - just the
head and crown of the Statue of Liberty.

Diamond smiles. She looks at him, wondering why -

WILL
It's to make sure we never forget where we came from.

The baby starts to cry. Will puts one arm each around Diamond and Eve.

We pull back from them - high up into the stars. The baby's cry carries
over. We see earth rise. In all this nothingness - life.
THE REVENANT

                         FADE IN:
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER MISSOURI RIVER/1820'S - EVENING
                         
          ANGLE ON A SINGLE COTTONWOOD LEAF... brown and crisp...
          clinging to its empty branch... the solitary sign of life on
          an otherwise barren tree.
                         
          A gust of wind... the leaf breaks free... flutters down,
          landing in the slow current of the Missouri. The last leaf
          of the fall, taking its final journey south.
                         
          As it floats along the surface, rising and falling with the
          current, all we can hear is the river's gentle movement...
          the trickle of water... the splash of timid rapids... until
          DISTANT VOICES invade this world... soft at first, but
          growing louder... LAUGHTER... SINGING.
                         
          And then our leaf CRASHES INTO A WOODEN BOARD... the BOW OF A
          BOAT. We hear the VOICES EVEN CLEARER... MEN'S VOICES, as we
          rise up the bow... see it's a FLATBOAT BEACHED ON A SANDBAR
          at the center of the river.
                         
          Beyond the flatboat are the voices... TWENTY MEN of the Rocky
          Mountain Fur Company, making camp along the shore... hauling
          wood, building campfires, pitching squares of canvas for
          makeshift rooftops. And this camp is full of life because
          these are some of the first men to ever see this untouched
          wilderness... men with a whole new world just waiting for
          them to claim their share.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - EVENING
                         
          CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY, (late 20's), dressed in a buckskin
          jacket with long fringe... thick belt pulled tightly around
          his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging from it. He
          stands out among the others... like an imposter pretending to
          be a member of some exclusive club. He pulls off one of his
          gloves... examines the BLOOD-FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm.
                         
          From across the camp, JOHN FITZGERALD, (40's), solid and
          thick... dark eyes of a killer, watches Henry. He nudges
          MACE BOONE, (40's), a thief in a previous life.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Likely got a splinter. Can't
           figure what to do without Mama here
           to pull it out for him.
                         
          Boone chuckles... spits in Henry's direction.
           2.
                         
                          BOONE
           Need a doc, Captain?
                         
          Henry looks up... sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him.
          He slides his glove back on.
                         
                          HENRY
           Gather more wood.
                         
          Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn, then gives his back an
          exaggerated salute.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (under his breath)
           Shame my Pap was a broken down
           drunk. Else he could've bought me
           a Captain's job too.
                         
          Boone snickers. Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch,
          easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           We got a plan for these fires,
           Captain, or are we roastin' berries
           all the way up to Fort Union?
                         
                          HENRY
           Glass and the others will be back
           with some game, Fitzgerald. Just
           make sure you have the fires ready.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           My supper's in the hands of a
           hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy.
           Hell, my belly feels full already.
                         
          Fitzgerald's boot CRACKS another branch... and when it does,
          we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - EVENING
                         
          And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN
          ANSTADT RIFLE.
                         
          The smoke fades, and at the other end of the rifle we see the
          face of HUGH GLASS, (40's), African-American, one eye still
          closed, as the other calmly stares down that barrel.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass!
           3.
                         
          Glass lowers the rifle, as PIG GILMORE, (30's), fat and
          filthy, races past.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Square as a barn door.
                         
          JIM BRIDGER, (17), young eyes that have already seen a lot,
          nods to Glass as he follows Pig.
                         
          Glass watches Pig and Bridger trot through the trees to a
          fallen ELK. Glass walks calmly after them, graceful in this
          world... his rifle so comfortable in his hand it's like he
          was born with it there. Pig crouches over the dead elk...
          grins up at Glass.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Right where you said he'd be.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           But bigger than we figured. Gonna
           be a load to haul back to camp.
                         
                          PIG
           Have to split it up I reckon.
                         
                          GLASS
           Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and
           Pig you haul the rest.
                         
          And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow,
          because he just nods... pulls out his knife to cut the tail
          off for Bridger.
                         
          Bridger and Glass exchange a smile... until Glass notices
          something... steps over the elk, his eyes locked on the
          ground beside it. He runs a finger over the dirt... touches
          a broken twig.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Another one close by?
                         
          Glass doesn't answer... studies the track... feels the nearby
          brush... inhales the scent from his hand. Bridger and Pig
          watch him... exchange a confused glance. And then in a flash
          of movement, Glass is on his feet, racing away.
                         
                          PIG
           Hugh?
                         
          Glass just keeps running. Pig and Bridger chase after him.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           4.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - EVENING
                         
          The men building fires... laughing... enjoying themselves.
          Boone on the outskirts, gathering branches.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS...
                         
          ...dodging trees... leaping over fallen logs... loading his
          Anstadt as he runs.
                         
                         
          BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS...
                         
          ...but not as gracefully. Pig trips... slams to the
          ground... scrambles back to his feet to continue on.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          BOONE - CARRYING AN ARMLOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP...
                         
          ...seeing other men playing cards. He stops along the edge
          of camp, drops the wood to the ground.
                         
                          BOONE
           No rule says I'm the only one
           that's gotta gather this shit.
                         
          The other men don't even notice. Then an ARROW WHIZZES
          THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone... THWACK... it hits him in
          the back of the neck... erupts out the front of his throat.
                         
          Boone stands frozen... confused... reaches up and grabs the
          bloody arrow... finally drops to his knees. And that's when
          a TRAPPER looks up... sees Boone on his knees, holding that
          arrow, his mouth open like a dying fish.
                         
          AND BEYOND BOONE ARE FORTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH
          THE TREES... FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR
          SHAVED HEADS... FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE.
                         
                          TRAPPER
           `REE!
                         
          WHOOSH... AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER'S CHEST, sending
          him flying backward. The camp explodes into chaos... men
          YELLING... grabbing for weapons... stumbling over each other
          as they duck behind trees.
           5.
                         
                         
          HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT...
                         
          ...taking aim at the attacking figures.
                         
          The Arikara pour into camp, arrows flying... knives and
          hatchets swinging. And this is a massacre... the Arikara
          wading through the trappers... stabbing... clubbing...
          scalping. This once peaceful world is filled with a sickening
          mix of war cries and screams of death.
                         
          Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log... aims his rifle...
          BOOM... takes down one of the warriors. He starts reloading
          as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him... draws back his knife.
          Fitzgerald pours the powder, but knows he isn't going to make
          it in time... the warrior leaps toward him...
                         
          ...BOOM... it's like the warrior hits an invisible wall...
          flies back to the ground, very dead. Fitzgerald spins...
          sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him.
                         
                          GLASS
           GET TO THE BOAT!
                         
          Fitzgerald takes off... flips his rifle around, swings it
          like a club across a warrior's head... WHACK!
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
                          (TO HENRY)
           THE BOAT, CAPTAIN!
                         
          Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water. An arrow drives
          into the trapper's leg... he goes down. Henry lifts the man
          to pull him into the river, but several more arrows bury in
          the man's back... he falls limp. Henry FIRES HIS PISTOLS,
          dropping the WARRIOR.
                         
          Bridger and Pig join Glass... splash into the river, SHOOTING
          back at the attacking Arikara. The water deepens, and they
          start swimming toward the flatboat.
                         
          ARROWS HISS into the water all around them.
                         
          Glass is still in the shallows... aims his pistol... BAM...
          shoots an oncoming warrior... spins after the other men...
          joins them as they near the flatboat.
                         
          A final TRAPPER charges down the shore behind them. SEVERAL
          WARRIORS pursue him.
                         
                          TRAPPER
           WAIT!
           6.
                         
          He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs... pulls the
          trigger... CLICK... pulls it again... CLICK. But he's too
          scared to stop his finger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
          THUD... as a hatchet buries in his back. He crashes face
          first into the shallows.
                         
          The Arikara leader, (ELK'S TONGUE), animal bones braided into
          his mohawk, a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck,
          straddles the dying man. Elk's Tongue grabs the Trapper by
          the hair, and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR, then holds it up to
          Glass and the others, as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY.
                         
          Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar... start
          scrambling aboard, as arrows dart past them... drive into the
          wooden boat.
                         
          Suddenly a WARRIOR EXPLODES FROM THE WATER... tackles Bridger
          as he climbs up the side of the flatboat... jerks him back
          into the river. Bridger flails in the water... watches the
          warrior raise his hatchet high to slam down... just as Glass
          SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS ANSTADT into the back of the Warrior's
          head.
                         
          The Warrior collapses under the surface. Glass grabs
          Bridger's hand... drags him up onto the deck.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Thank you.
                         
          But Glass is already gone... FIRING BACK AT THE ARIKARA, as
          the current carries them away.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           HEY!
                         
          Pig looks over the side... sees a frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON
          gripped to the edge. Pig pulls him onto the boat.
                         
          Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES... shove them against the
          river's bottom to pick up speed.
                         
          Henry stands on deck, watching as Elk's Tongue yanks a DYING
          TRAPPER's head back by his hair to peel away his scalp.
                         
          Henry drops his eyes... can't watch. The TRAPPER'S SCREAM
          ECHOES OVER HIM.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - LATER
                         
          Quiet and dark... the battle long over. The flatboat floats
          with the gentle current. The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are
          scattered around the deck...
           7.
          Glass digging an arrow out of WALLACE MURPHY'S SHOULDER...
          Fitzgerald poling on one side with Anderson on the other...
          STUBBY BILL VANCE and Pig standing patrol with their
          rifles... Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED TRAPPER... and
          Henry standing at the front of the flatboat, staring off
          blankly.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What's the plan, Captain?
                         
          Henry's still lost in those screams.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Captain! What the hell do we do
           now?
                         
          Henry snaps out of his stare... turns to the men... obviously
          doesn't have an answer.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           We're just floatin' farther from
           Fort Union.
                         
          Henry's eyes instinctively look to Glass.
                         
                          GLASS
           The Missouri's no good. Not if the
           `Ree's running it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           So we just float the hell down to
           Mexico or wherever else this river
           takes us?
                         
                          GLASS
           We get ourselves safe outta range,
           then track another course up.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Add weeks to the trip.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Better that than endin' up scalped
           on the side of the river.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (shoving him away)
           Shut up, kid, you don't get no say
           in this.
                         
          Bridger starts to respond, but Fitzgerald's angry glare stops
          him.
           8.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           (back to Henry)
           And in case you hadn't noticed,
           Captain, we're twelve men short of
           what we were.
           (off the badly wounded
                          TRAPPER)
           Thirteen before long.
                         
                          HENRY
           I understand our situation, Mr.
           Fitzgerald. We do like Glass
           said... put some distance between
           us and the Arikara, then chart a
           course to Fort Union.
                         
          Fitzgerald MUMBLES UNDER HIS BREATH... rolls those dark eyes
          to Anderson. Glass gives Henry a nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER/FLATBOAT - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER... NOW DEAD...
                         
          ...as hands push the body over the side of the boat. It
          splashes into the water... floats downstream.
                         
          We PULL BACK... see that the flatboat is beached along the
          bank of the river. Glass and Pig watch the body drift away.
                         
                          PIG
           Reckon it's better `an lettin' the
           `Ree find him... take his ears...
           slice what's left all to shit.
                         
          Glass nods... steps down off the boat to Henry and the
          others. They're gathered around a map spread out on the
          ground. Henry runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE.
                         
                          HENRY
           So we hike west to the Grand, then
           follow it up to Fort Union.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           On foot? You got any idea how long
           that's gonna take? It'll be winter
           before we get there.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Unless we come across a post...
           trade for some horses.
           9.
                         
                          GLASS
           No posts that far out.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           So if we do this, we do every step
           with our own feet.
                         
                          HENRY
           We make camp here for the night,
           then load supplies and head out for
           the Grand at first light.
                          (BEAT)
           And gather extra blankets `cause
           there won't be any fires.
                         
          More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson, as they move
          toward the cover of trees. Bridger walks up beside Glass.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Thank you... for what you done back
           there.
                         
                          GLASS
           You'd have done the same for me.
                         
          Bridger nods... he hopes so.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          Pig on watch... sitting at the base of a tree, rifle across
          his lap, eyes wide, scanning the darkness. All clear. He
          peers back to camp... Fitzgerald, Anderson, Stubby Bill, and
          Murphy wrapped in blankets... passing a bottle of whiskey
          around. Bridger across from Fitzgerald, poking at the dirt
          with a stick. Henry is off to one side, still studying that
          map. Glass sits against a tree, cleaning his Anstadt rifle.
                         
          Fitzgerald watches Glass a beat, then...
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You treat that Anstadt sweeter than
           any woman, Glass.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Never seen a woman that could stop
           a `Ree from three hundred feet.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I knew a particular big-breasted
           redhead in Boston that might come
           close.
           10.
                         
          The others manage a small laugh. Glass just keeps working on
          that rifle.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Bring it over here for me to have a
           look.
                         
          Glass doesn't look up... wipes a rag down the barrel.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Did you hear what I said, boy?
                         
          Still nothing from Glass. And Fitzgerald doesn't like
          that... the tension's growing.
                         
                          BRIDGER
                          (MUMBLING)
           You seen it before.
                         
          Fitzgerald turns that mean, drunken glare on Bridger.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What'd you say, kid?
                         
          Bridger hesitates a beat... until the other men's eyes force
          a response.
                         
                          BRIDGER
                          (SOFTLY)
           I said you shoulda already got a
           look when he saved you with it
           earlier.
                         
          The camp falls still... nobody talks to Fitzgerald like
          that... especially when he's drunk. There isn't a sound
          except for Glass working methodically on his rifle...
                         
          ...until the SWISH OF BLADE OVER LEATHER, as Fitzgerald tears
          the blade from his belt... flings it into the dirt between
          Bridger's legs... AN INCH BELOW HIS CROTCH.
                         
          Fitzgerald stares at Bridger, daring him to react. But
          Bridger's too scared... doesn't, so Fitzgerald just smiles.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You're lucky you ain't a man yet.
           (off the blade)
           Else that mighta nicked somethin'.
                         
          A few NERVOUS CHUCKLES from the others, hoping this is over.
          And it is, because Fitzgerald reaches over and pulls the
          knife away... cleans the dirty blade on Bridger's leg.
           11.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And unlike you, I don't need savin'
           by him or nobody else. Remember
           that.
                         
          Fitzgerald stands... wobbles just a bit. He slides the knife
          back into his belt, then steadies his drunken gaze on Glass.
                         
          The others exchange nervous glances... uh-oh.
                         
          Fitzgerald walks to Glass... snaps his fingers for Glass'
          Anstadt.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Lemme see what's so special `bout
           that shooter of yours.
                         
          Nothing from Glass, so Fitzgerald grabs the barrel, but Glass
          holds firm.
                         
                          GLASS
           Middle of workin' on it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Well you can stop workin' on it,
           and let me have a look like I said.
                         
          Fitzgerald gives another tug, but Glass' grip only grows
          tighter. His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald... make it clear he
          isn't giving up his rifle. And they hold that stare just as
          hard as they're holding Glass' rifle.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You forget your place?
                         
                          GLASS
           Best I can tell, my place is right
           where I want it... on the smart end
           of my rifle.
                         
          Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he's holding is aimed right at
          his stomach, while Glass' hand seems suddenly very close to
          the trigger. But Fitzgerald's pride and that whiskey won't
          let him lose this tug of war.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I'd be careful if I was you, boy.
                         
          And this thing's about to turn real ugly... until...
                         
                          HENRY
           That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go
           sober up and get to sleep.
                          (MORE)
           12.
                          HENRY(CONT'D)
           If you're passed out when we break
           camp tomorrow, I leave you here.
                         
          Fitzgerald holds his glare on Glass, then releases the rifle,
          shoving it back at Glass. He glances to Henry, and throws
          back a big gulp from the bottle just for spite, before
          backing away from Glass.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That's the trouble with this part
           of the world. No mirrors. Niggers
           forget what color they are.
                         
          Glass ignores Fitzgerald... goes back to his rifle.
          Fitzgerald tosses the bottle at Anderson, then jerks his
          blanket up... walks off to sleep by himself.
                         
          Glass glances up from his work... just long enough to give
          Bridger a nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - LATER
                         
          Fitzgerald sleeping off that whiskey. The others snoring in
          a cluster at the center of the camp. Henry lies there
          awake... looks across to Glass, still sitting against the
          tree, a HANDRAWN MAP in his lap, as his eyes pierce the
          darkness. Henry eases over to Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           Can't sleep either?
                         
                          GLASS
           Never like closin' my eyes when I'm
           not sure who'll be standin' over me
           when I open `em.
                         
                          HENRY
           I keep thinking about Boone and the
           others... how maybe I should've had
           us make camp further up river.
                         
                          GLASS
           The tracks I saw... those `Ree had
           been tailin' us for a while. They'd
           have gone as far north as it took.
                          (BEAT)
           You're a good man, Captain. Soon
           as you realize that, these others
           will too.
                         
          Henry likes hearing that... still isn't sure it's true.
           13.
                         
                          HENRY
           Your years trappin' and guidin' out
           here... have you had much
           experience with the Arikara?
                         
                          GLASS
           Enough to try and stay outta their
           way.
                         
                          HENRY
           (motions to Glass' map)
           But you know this country well
           enough to get us past them... up to
           Fort Union?
                         
                          GLASS
           I been here a long while. Whether
           that gets us to Union or not...
                         
          Henry waits for more... doesn't get it. So he just nods and
          starts back to his blanket.... stops.
                         
                          HENRY
           What Fitzgerald said earlier... he
           doesn't speak for the rest.
                         
                          GLASS
           He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's
           what I prefer about this country...
           it's got no eye for the color of a
           man's skin.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (BEAT)
           Try to get some sleep, Hugh.
                         
          Henry climbs back under his blanket. Glass just sits there
          looking at the map.
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS' MAP...
                         
          ...primitive at best. Sketched mountains... winding blue
          lines for rivers... small dots are scattered about with names
          beside them... "Brazeau", "Talbot", "Union". And DOZENS OF
          TRIANGLE PINE TREES have been drawn, representing the endless
          wilderness.
                         
          We TIGHTEN ON THOSE TRIANGLES until we're lost in them.

          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Thick with trees. Henry leads the men single file through
          the woods. They each have a canvas sack of supplies over one
          shoulder, and their rifle in their hands.
                         
          The only sound is their feet crunching the dried leaves, and
          even that seems too loud as their eyes dart about, searching
          for any sign of attack.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by
           now?
                         
                          HENRY
           We'll reach it soon enough. Glass
           said to keep this course.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Glass said. Too bad I don't see
           him.
                         
                          PIG
           That's on account he's up ahead
           makin' sure it's clear, and you get
           to keep your ears.
                         
          Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Or he's run off and left us.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           He wouldn't do that.
                         
          Fitzgerald GRUNTS... doesn't believe that.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           My bet, that nigger's used to
           runnin'.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - DAY
                         
          Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding...
          subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves...
          careful not to leave his scent behind. And his eyes cut
          through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of
          movement.
                         
          He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his
          finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt.
           15.
                         
          O.S. RUSTLING snaps his head up... to the TREMBLING OF
          BUSHES... growing harder... whatever's in there is coming
          toward Glass. He calmly raises his rifle... presses the
          stock firmly against his shoulder... closes one eye as he
          takes steady aim down the long barrel...
                         
          ...to the shapes rumbling out of the brush... TWO BEAR CUBS
          playfully wrestling.
                         
          Glass lowers the Anstadt... looks past the cubs for something
          else... but the woods are empty. A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS'
          EYES...
                         
          ...he spins... right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW
          AT HIM... hitting him across the side of the neck. The
          animal's razor claws tear into Glass' throat, as the force
          sends him flying through the air.
                         
          Glass sails into a thick tree... the CRACK OF HIS LEG
          SNAPPING against the trunk. The rifle falls from his hand.
          The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR... charges Glass. Glass
          crawls to the Anstadt... grabs it... has just enough time to
          tilt the rifle toward the bear... BOOM.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST.
                         
                          HENRY
           UP AHEAD!
                         
          Henry takes off at full sprint. The other men follow.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM...
                         
          ...tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing. Glass hits the
          ground with a PAINFUL THUD. He starts CRAWLING AWAY, pulling
          the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant
          behind him... swings... tears its claws across Glass's back,
          shredding deep into his flesh.
                         
          Glass is fighting for his life now... flailing with the
          knife... slicing it across the bear's paw as it whips past
          him. The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start
          crawling again.
                         
          But the Grizzly doesn't give Glass the chance... ROARS... is
          on him in a flash, a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS... tearing
          across Glass' head... ripping into his face... his chest.
           16.
                         
          Glass drives his knife into the bear again... deep... trying
          to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST.

          GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE...
                         
          ...locked in a death grip... tumbling along the ground...
          trading violent blows... Glass' blade versus the Grizzly's
          claws and fangs... snapping small trees as they roll over
          them... toward the edge of a steep embankment...
                         
          ... and ROLL DOWN... spinning over and over... each ROARING
          AT THE OTHER... Glass pounding the knife into the bear again
          and again as they fall... neither willing to surrender as
          they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace, then SLAM TO
          THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH. And the forest falls still...
          Glass hidden somewhere beneath the massive animal... both
          deathly motionless.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - DAY
                         
          Bridger's the first to reach the battleground... sees the TWO
          FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY. He follows the bloody
          ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope...
          looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Christ Almighty.
                         
          Henry, Pig, and the others reach the edge.
                         
                          HENRY
           Glass!
                         
          No answer. And all they can see is the bear, so they scan
          the trees.
                         
                          PIG
           HUGH!
                         
          Still nothing. So Bridger takes off down the slope... losing
          his balance but rolling back to his feet. He reaches the
          bear... sees GLASS' MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.
           17.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           He's down here!
                         
          Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off, as the
          other men scramble down. But Bridger can't budge the massive
          carcass... not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in... shove the
          animal over, revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass...
                         
          ...his throat is torn wide open... scalp peeled back from
          just above his eyebrows, hanging off the skull... stomach and
          chest a gruesome design of gashes and cuts. His right leg
          is snapped, the jagged bone jutting out through the skin.
                         
          Bridger's legs give out... he drops to a knee and vomits.
                         
                          MURPHY
           Oh, Jesus.

           He's tore to pieces.
                         
          The men stare down at Glass' corpse.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Least he took that Grizz down with
           him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Wished he'da done it without firing
           his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree
           around before, there will be now.
                         
          And that's all Pig can stand... he TACKLES FITZGERALD... they
          roll to the ground. And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top,
          raining punches down on Pig... turning his face into a bloody
          mess.
                         
          Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald... drag him off.
                         
                          HENRY
           THAT'S ENOUGH!
                         
          Then somehow, GLASS GASPS... this horrible, GUTTURAL MOAN.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Holy Christ, he's alive.
                         
          Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass. Glass
          looks up at the men, tries to focus through the blood and
          pain. His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE... bubbles
          forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp.
           18.
                         
                          HENRY
           Get me some water.
                         
          Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen. Henry empties it over
          Glass' throat... his face and scalp. The water hits the
          wounds and immediately transforms to blood.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Oh, Jesus... Jesus.
                         
          Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat... feels the
          gaping wound. His eyes widen in horror. He COUGHS... the
          air splashes blood up from the open wounds in his throat.
                         
                          HENRY
           It's okay, Hugh.
           (pushing Glass' hand away)
           You're going to be fine.
                         
          Henry spins his head away from Glass.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           I need some rags before he bleeds
           out.
                         
          Pig whips a shirt from his bag... shreds it.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           And your whiskey.
                         
          Pig tosses a bottle to Henry. Henry pours it over the
          gashes. The BURNING PAIN arches Glass... he CRIES OUT in
          that same horrific moan.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit.
                         
          Bridger throws his weight against Glass' shoulders.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           The rest of you spread out... scout
           a circle around us. Fitzgerald,
           you and Anderson take west and
           north. Murphy and Mike south and
           east. Watch for anyone that
           might've heard that shot.
                         
          And for the first time, Henry seems like a leader of men...
          firm... in complete control... just as Glass said he would
          be. So the men hurry off to their positions.
           19.
                         
                          PIG
           What about me, Cap?
                         
                          HENRY
           Get down here and help me tie off
           these wounds best we can.
                         
          Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds. The blood
          keeps seeping out, soaking the rags.
                         
                          PIG
           It won't stop bleedin'.
                         
                          HENRY
           Shut up, Pig.
                          (TO GLASS)
           We're fixing you up, Hugh.
                         
          Glass is like a shredded rag doll... dazed eyes staring up at
          them as they work on his wounds... wrapping the rags around
          his throat... laying his scalp back over his skull, and tying
          another rag around it and under his jaw to hold it in place.
                         
          Bridger wipes the blood from Glass' face.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass.
                         
          Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over
          his knees... oozing out from beneath Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           Roll him over... easy.
                         
          They gently push Glass onto one side, revealing DEEP, JAGGED,
          GASHES running across the width of Glass' back. Henry stares
          at the open flesh, ready to panic again... but he doesn't.
          Instead he looks to Pig.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Get me the kit. We need to stitch
           his back up.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What about the rest of him?
                         
                          HENRY
           He's losing more blood back here.
           (off the throat)
           And I don't know what to do with
           that yet.
           20.
                         
          Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread...
          hands it to Henry. Henry grabs the whiskey bottle.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry for how this is about to
           burn, Hugh.
                         
          Henry pours the whiskey over Glass' back. And the pain must
          be excruciating, because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees.
          Glass' scream erupts through the trees, and they both
          immediately crouch down to a knee... out of sight to anyone
          out there that might have heard that.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           They're torturin' the poor bastard.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           And riskin' gettin' us killed in
           the process. Proper thing would be
           to end it for him quick.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           `Less he could pull through.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You seen what that grizz did to
           him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside
           a hour. We all will be if he keeps
           screamin' like that.

          SERIES OF SHOTS
                         
          HENRY, BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS... Bridger and Pig
          pressing Glass' scalp down, as Henry slides the needle and
          thread through the skin, suturing the wound.
                         
          HENRY CLEANING GLASS' SHREDDED THROAT.
                         
          BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING THE SCREAMING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY
          SNAPS GLASS' LEG BACK IN PLACE.
           21.
                         
          FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES... to Henry
          doctoring Glass. Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger...
          turns back to the darkening forest.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - EVENING
                         
          Glass rests unconscious on the ground. Two branches act as a
          splint on his leg. A blanket covers his body... his face is
          like a swollen, disfigured, Frankenstein's monster...
          stitches of black thread holding it in place.
                         
          Henry crouches a short distance away from him, rinsing his
          hands under a canteen. Bridger and Pig stand beside him.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What now?
                         
                          HENRY
           We wait. Does he have any kin you
           know of?
                         
                          PIG
           He keeps to hisself. Never
           mentioned none.
                         
                          HENRY
           Go get the others. Tell `em we're
           making camp here for the night.
                         
          Pig starts hustling away.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           And gather some wood, but make sure
           it's dry. We don't want much smoke
           when we cook that grizzly.
                         
                         
          ANGLE ON THE MASSIVE BEAR...
                         
          ...lying dead on the ground, its claws and fangs soaked with
          blood... Glass' blood.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          And what's left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs
          of flesh butchered from its skeleton.
                         
          A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts
          above the flame. The men sit around the fire...
           22.
          Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast,
          tossing it in his mouth. The men are silent... the pall of
          Glass' attack still hanging over them.
                         
          Bridger rises... walks to the Grizzly... crouches down over
          it, grabbing the animal's enormous paw. It dwarfs his own
          hand, as he examines the claws. Bridger pulls out his
          knife... stretches the claw out to its full length, and CUTS
          IT OFF AT ITS BASE.
                         
           FITZGERALD (O.S.)
           What makes you think you earned a
           claw?
                         
          Bridger turns with a start... sees Fitzgerald standing over
          him, meat in his hand... his lips shiny with the grease.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You didn't take that grizz down.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It ain't for me.
                         
          Bridger stands... walks over to the sleeping Glass. Pig's
          already crouched beside him. Bridger lifts Glass' small
          leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the Anstadt rifle... drops
          the claw inside... throws a look back to Fitzgerald.
                         
          Pig holds his palm out just above Glass' mouth.
                         
                          PIG
           I can feel some air outta his
           mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his
           throat proper, huh?
           (off Bridger's silence)
           Whatta you figure his odds are,
           Jim?
                         
          Bridger stares down at what's left of Glass.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Long.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
                         
          The sun peeks over the horizon, sending an orange glow across
          the treetops.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - MORNING
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS...
           23.
                         
          ...unconscious but alive... his raspy breaths are weak and
          staggered. The SHADOWS OF MEN hover over him...
                         
          ...because Henry and the others surround Glass, staring down
          at him.
                         
                          MURPHY
           What that bear did to him... I
           didn't expect he'd last this long.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I seen a fella go a week once after
           a lion jumped him. Fever finally
           finished him off.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Whatta we do, Cap?
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          HENRY
           We give him his chance.
                         
          Henry turns and walks away.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          The fire has burned down to nothing. The men sleep scattered
          about. Murphy stands just outside of camp, rifle ready,
          keeping watch.
                         
          Glass lies there awake... eyes wide open... a living corpse.
          And his breathing is just as labored as before... raspy,
          blood-soaked strains.
                         
          Fitzgerald tosses and turns, listening to Glass' gurgling.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You ain't doin' him or us no
           favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer
           that way.
                         
          Henry's awake, but doesn't answer. He's holding his pistol
          in his hand, as he stares at Glass... thinking the same thing
          Fitzgerald just said. But he doesn't move... not yet.
                         
          Fitzgerald angrily wraps a blanket around his head, muffling
          the sound. Bridger sits beyond him... smiles at Fitzgerald's
          misery, as he attaches the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN LEATHER
          STRAP... a necklace.
           24.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - MORNING
                         
          Bridger kneels over a SHIVERING GLASS, holding wet rags on
          his head. Pig and Henry stand over them, watching.
                         
          Fitzgerald, Anderson, Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled
          across camp.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Fever's hit. Won't be long now.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I seen a bad one drag on days.
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS...
                         
          ...eyes open... he can hear every word.
                         
           FITZGERALD (O.S.) (cont'd)
           Insides shut down... flesh starts
           to spoil and turn. Ain't no way
           for...
                         
           HENRY (O.S.)
           Quiet, Fitzgerald.
                         
          FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...points a stick at Glass.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (TO HENRY)
           We keep sittin' here watchin' him
           die, only gives the `Ree more
           chance to find us.
                         
          Henry doesn't answer... just keeps staring down at Glass.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to
           boil as soon as it touches him.
                         
          Henry considers this, then...
                         
                          HENRY
           Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead.
           Grand should be just west of here.
           Find us the best route.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make
           sense for the rest of us, Captain.
           25.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (TO PIG)
           Get movin'.
                         
          Pig nods... grabs his gear. He and Anderson take off out of
          camp. Henry turns... walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby
          Bill.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           You two can start digging a grave.
                         
          Fitzgerald tosses the stick away.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Least it's a step in the right
           direction.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - LATER
                         
          Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat, standing knee deep
          in Glass' grave. Stubby Bill stands over him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Any coyote digs that deep deserves
           the meal.
                         
          He takes Stubby Bill's hand... pulls himself out.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Glass won't know the difference no
           ways.
                         
          Pig and Anderson walk back into camp.
                         
                          PIG
           Found it, Cap. Right where Glass
           had us headed.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           No more than a mile or so out.
                         
          Henry looks to Bridger, still doctoring Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           We could build a litter. Haul him
           with us.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           It's rocky and steep goin'.
                         
          Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer.
           26.
                         
                          PIG
           Marshy and thick on the other side.
           We could try it, but...
                         
          Pig shakes his head.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I signed on as a trapper, not a
           goddamn mule.
                         
                          BRIDGER
                          (TO HENRY)
           Shape he's in... I don't see no way
           he'd make bein' drug.
                         
          Henry nods, his mind racing for a solution. And before long,
          his hand is back on that pistol. He pulls it from his belt.
                         
          The other men all drop their heads... except for
          Fitzgerald... he's ready to see this end.
                         
          Henry stares down at Glass.
                         
                          HENRY
           Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr.
           Bridger.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           But, Captain.
                         
                          HENRY
           Do it.
                         
          Bridger hesitates, then reaches to fold the wet rag down over
          Glass' wide open eyes. And Glass must know what's happening,
          because his eyes roll up to Bridger's... his lips try to form
          a word... his hand digs its fingers into the dirt beside him.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON BRIDGER...
                         
          ...the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes...
          everything goes black.
                         
           HENRY (O.S.)
           Step clear, Mr. Bridger.
                         
          A LONG BEAT in the dark, waiting for that gunshot, then...
                         
          BACK TO SCENE
           27.
                         
          Henry standing over Glass... pistol aimed down. His hand
          trembles slightly.
                         
          Pig turns away... presses his hands over his ears.
                         
          Bridger takes a few steps back... stares at Henry.
                         
          Henry struggles to steady his aim, until finally it calms...
          because he's thought of something else.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           There's a seventy dollar bonus from
           the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to
           the two men that stay with Glass...
           see this through. Then give him a
           proper burial.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'll stay with him... money or not.
                         
                          PIG
           Same here.
                         
                          HENRY
           I can't let you stay back, Pig.
           Without Glass, I'll need you to
           scout.
                         
          Henry looks to the others... they all drop their eyes... not
          interested.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Just need one more.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Two won't stand much chance against
           a party of `Ree, Captain, and
           seventy dollars won't buy me a new
           setta ears.
                         
                          HENRY
           A hundred then.
                         
          Still nothing from the others.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           They can have my share too. I owe
           Glass that at least.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That case I'll hang back with the
           kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or
           so behind for two hundred.
           28.
                         
                          HENRY
           But Glass is to be cared for until.
           Understood?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (motions to Bridger)
           I'll let the young doctor do his
           job.
                         
          Henry hesitates... doesn't like this, but knows it's the best
          option left.
                         
                          HENRY
           The rest gather your gear.
                         
          Bridger reaches down... lifts the rag from Glass' face.
          Their eyes meet... Bridger gives Glass a nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - LATER
                         
          Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave. Pig
          bends down over Glass.
                         
                          PIG
           I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh.
                         
          Glass's glazed eyes focus on Pig. He moves the only thing he
          can... BLINKS a "yes" back at him.
                         
                          HENRY
           (to Fitzgerald and
                          BRIDGER)
           As long as necessary.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'll look after him.
                         
          Henry turns... leads the men into the trees... toward the
          Grand... toward Fort Union.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          What's left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash.
          Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth
          between his lips. Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass'
          Anstadt leaning against the tree.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I'll take first watch.
           29.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Not with his rifle.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be
           needin' it tonight.
                         
          Fitzgerald disappears into the trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course. He waves back to
          Henry and the others. They start toward him.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - EVENING
                         
          Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it...
          runs his hand down the barrel, as comfortable as if it were
          his own.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You were right to protect this.
                         
          Then he disappears... and we're left alone, staring up at the
          branches above us... the evening sky... accompanied by Glass'
          deathly breaths.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CREEK - DAY
                         
          Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - DAY
                         
          Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his
          hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing...
          repeating... twist... flip... thwack. And as he does, his
          eyes are locked on Glass.
           30.
                         
          Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands,
          and walks over to Glass. Glass is asleep. Fitzgerald
          crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (WHISPERS)
           When are you gonna die, boy?
                         
          Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one
          of the threads holding Glass' throat together. And when he
          does, GLASS' EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald.
                         
          Fitzgerald doesn't even flinch... just holds that knife tip
          there against Glass' throat.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I'm nearly a week behind Henry's
           bunch on accounta havin' to tend to
           you. Be easier on us all if you'd
           take that last breath.
                         
          The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the
          knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls
          it up in his fist.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I could help ya with that if you'd
           like. Muzzle ya right now... end
           all this sufferin' quick and easy.
           Nobody'd ever know you give up.
                         
          Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass' nose and mouth... holds
          it there, just inches above.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You just gimme a blink if you want
           me to do it.
                         
          Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald's... both men unblinking.
                         
          A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands
          on Glass' lips.
                         
          Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as
          Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink.
                         
          Suddenly Bridger's hand clamps down on Fitzgerald's shoulder.
          Fitzgerald spins... startled.
                         
           BRIDGER (O.S.)
           What's goin' on?
           31.
                         
          Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it's Bridger, and is
          pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his
          business. He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in
          Bridger's chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Don't you ever question me, you
           little piss-ant.
                         
          Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong...
          holds him pressed against the tree... slams a heavy elbow
          into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I'd just as soon leave both you and
           your nigger here to rot. `Cept
           killin' you ain't worth givin' up
           your share.
                          (LEANS CLOSER)
           But that don't mean I can't be
           coaxed into changin' my mind.
                         
          Fitzgerald shoves him away... Bridger stumbles and falls.
          Fitzgerald tosses the bloody rag at him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And I was just doin' your job...
           cleanin' him up.
                         
          Fitzgerald grabs Glass' Anstadt, almost daring Bridger to say
          something. Of course Bridger doesn't. Fitzgerald walks
          toward the trees.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Why don't ya pour some more broth
           down his throat... keep him alive
           another week so we can fall farther
           back. End up walkin' all the way
           to Fort Union on our own. `Ree
           would love to poach on just two.
           (turns to Bridger)
           I promise ya, you'll look a helluva
           lot worse than Glass when they're
           done with you.
                         
          Bridger watches him disappear into the trees... wipes the
          blood from his lip with a trembling hand.

          From high above the trees. The world is silent... peaceful...
          until SEVERAL STARTLED CROWS shoot up from the treetops.
                         
                          CUT TO:

           Bridger! Get your ass up!
                         
          Dim light fills the frame... then FITZGERALD'S FACE right in
          front of us.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)

          BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM UNDER HIS BLANKET, WIPING THE
          SLEEP FROM HIS FRIGHTENED EYES.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Keep quiet. I was down at the
           creek... there's twenty of `em at
           least, comin' this way.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Oh, shit. Whatta we do?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We run. Now.
                         
          And Fitzgerald's just whispering, but it's with such power
          that Bridger has no response... watches as Fitzgerald gathers
          his bag, starts throwing in food and supplies. Bridger is
          scared out of his mind... does the same... grabs for his
          rifle, resting near Glass.
                         
          Bridger freezes... in his panic, he'd forgotten all about
          Glass. And now the wounded man's eyes stare up at him...
          understanding perfectly what's happening around him.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What about Glass?
           33.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           He's on his own, same as us.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I can't leave him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Then I'm talkin' to a dead man.
                         
          Glass gives Bridger the slightest of nods... go. But
          Bridger's frozen... doesn't know what to do... until
          Fitzgerald shoves him back to life.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Move.
                         
          Glass reaches out a weak hand out for his Anstadt... clawing
          for his weapon. Bridger starts to hand it to Glass, but
          Fitzgerald grabs it first.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What're you doin'? He needs that.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           He couldn't hold it if you tarred
           it to his hands.
                         
          Glass strains to hold out his trembling hand for his gun.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It's his goddamn rifle! That's all
           he's got!
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           And more than he'll need.
                         
          Fitzgerald scoops up Glass' knife as well.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           We can't leave him with nothin'.
                         
          But Fitzgerald is already sprinting away... disappearing into
          the trees. Glass stares after him, his once-calm eyes
          suddenly filled with a rage. And Bridger's frozen again,
          lost between duty and fear... until finally, he just shakes
          his head and takes off into the trees.
                         
          Glass's empty hand falls back to the ground... he tries to
          yell out in anger, but his throat EXPLODES IN PAIN. His hand
          digs into the dirt... pulls him over onto his side. He flops
          over to his stomach... GASPS IN PAIN...
           34.
          then using his one good arm, drags himself over the dirt, his
          healthy leg pushing weakly at the ground, trying to propel
          him forward... a futile chase after Fitzgerald and Bridger...
                         
          ...inch by inch... farther than he's been in days. But it's
          still only a few yards, and now he lies in the open... a
          clear target for the Arikara.
                         
          Then he spots that hole... the grave Fitzgerald dug for him.
          He grunts into action... grabs SEVERAL, THIN BROKEN BRANCHES
          from the ground, then claws forward, each movement
          excruciating... until finally, he reaches the hole, and ROLLS
          INTO IT... lands with a PAINFUL CRUNCH.
                         
          He rests there a moment, trying to regain any ounce of
          strength. Finally he fights through the pain... shoves the
          branches back up... spreading them across the hole as
          camouflage... a thin veil, but all that Glass has.
                         
          He lies there defenseless... INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE. Hiding...
          listening for the Arikara's arrival... waiting to die.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          HIS PAINFUL BREATHS.

          EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
                         
          Cold and grey. Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire,
          warming his hands. WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We ran the better part of six
           hours. Had to gain some ground on
           Henry and them others.
                         
          Bridger sits at the base of a tree, not listening...
          staring... his mind replaying the desertion of Glass over and
          over. He notices the smoke.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Best douse that smoke before them
           `Ree spot it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We put enough distance between us
           and them. And it's too damn cold
           to go without one.
           35.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           All we know, they hoofed it through
           the night same as us.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (shakes his head)
           A dozen `Ree can't make the time us
           two did.
                         
          Bridger looks back to the trees... then considers something,
          stares at Fitzgerald a beat, before...
                         
                          BRIDGER
           It was twenty earlier.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What?
                         
                          BRIDGER
           When you woke me... you said you'd
           spotted twenty `Ree.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a
           mood to count feathers. Hell, one
           `Ree woulda been too many.
                         
          Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire, killing the
          flames. Bridger stares at the water pouring out.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           What was you even doin' down at the
           creak in the middle of the night?
                          (BEAT)
           I'd already brought plenty a water.
                         
          Fitzgerald doesn't answer. Bridger tightens his grip on his
          rifle... slowly rises.
                         
                          BRIDGER (CONT'D)
           Answer me.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Don't start questionin' me on
           accounta you feelin' guilty `bout
           leavin' your nigger buddy behind.
                         
          Bridger musters up all the courage he can... aims his rifle
          at Fitzgerald.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD
           OFF!
           36.
                         
          Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle... eyes
          taking in everything... a snake sizing up its prey. Then
          Fitzgerald stands... takes a step toward the boy.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           What're you askin'? Why it was you
           turned your back on Glass? Why you
           let him die to save your own sorry
           skin?
                          (BEAT)
           `Cause you was scared shitless,
           that's why.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           The `Ree... did you see `em?
           (off Fitzgerald's silence)
           DID YOU SEE `EM?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (MOVING CLOSER)
           Not a one.
                         
          Bridger CRIES OUT... starts to pull the trigger, when
          Fitzgerald's hand flashes out, grabbing the barrel, and
          shoving the butt back into Bridger's face... THWACK.
                         
          The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground, but
          Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel... flips it
          around to aim it at the boy. Blood drips down Bridger's head
          as he stares up at his rifle pointed down.
                         
          Fitzgerald's finger tightens on the trigger.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           So that there is the answer to your
           question.
                         
          And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER... AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS
          EYES SHUT IN FEAR... THEN CLICK. Bridger opens his eyes...
          sees Fitzgerald sneering down at him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And the next time you aim to kill
           somebody, kid, best remember your
           gun won't fire without a flint.
                         
          Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger, and turns away.
          Bridger's face flushes with rage and humiliation... he
          charges Fitzgerald from behind... tackles him to the
          ground... starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches.
                         
          A few of them land, but it's only a moment before Fitzgerald
          is back in control... HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him...
           37.
          tossing him away, then KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH...
          AGAIN. He grabs his knife... is ready to finish Bridger
          off...
                         
          ...but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here, two
          are safer than one... even when one is just a kid. He starts
          walking away.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'm goin' back for him.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Far as we ran all night, you
           couldn't find Glass with dogs and a
           map. And I don't believe you
           really want to. `Cause after
           leavin' him to die the first time,
           I doubt he'd be too happy to see
           you now.
                         
          Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife... covers the
          fire's remains.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And just so we're clear. If you
           try to backtrack without me
           knowin', or ever get so guilty you
           feel the need to tell somebody.
                         
          Fitzgerald looks at Bridger... hard... evil.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I'll have no choice but to gut you
           from nuts to nose.
                         
          Fitzgerald stares his point home, then shoves the blade into
          his belt, and stands.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Now let's go.
                         
          Bridger wipes the blood from his face, then throws one last
          glance behind him before following Fitzgerald.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAMP - MORNING
                         
          Empty and quiet... no sign of life... until GLASS' HAND RISES
          BETWEEN THE BRANCHES. His fingers dig into the earth,
          pulling himself up from the hole... a dead man climbing out
          of his own grave.
                         
          He rolls out to the ground... arches in pain when his back
          hits the cold, hard surface.
           38.
          Glass lies there shivering, regaining what little strength he
          has, then rolls over... starts dragging himself again with
          that one good arm. He makes it to the blanket... wraps it
          around him.
                         
          Glass rests there in the center of camp... unable to move...
          his eyes scanning the surroundings... no food... no water...
          and he's wide open in this clearing... an easy target for any
          predator. So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN,
          and drags himself toward the cover of brush.
                         
          And every movement takes all the will Glass has... a push
          with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm...
          inch by inch... foot by foot... sweat pouring down his face
          as he finally reaches the cover of the trees... continues
          on... dragging himself across the forest floor in a
          desperate, hopeless crawl for survival.
                         
          But finally it's too much for Glass... the fever and pain
          overwhelm him. He collapses... falls unconscious.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass lies in the dirt, weak... dehydrated... starving. He
          looks at his hands... scratched and bloody from clawing his
          weight.
                         
          He unwraps his small, leather Possibles bag... dumps it to
          the ground, revealing it contents... flints, a straight
          razor, his map, and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR
          CLAW attached. Glass grabs the razor... cuts SEVERAL THIN
          STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET, and wraps them around his hands.
                         
          He shoves the rest back in the bag, and does the only thing
          he can do... start crawling again... push with his healthy
          leg... pull with his good arm.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER
                         
          Glass dragging himself up a steep slope... over rocks... the
          jagged edges catching the wounds... tearing the primitive
          stitching. The gashes rip wider... blood oozes down, leaving
          a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          The wind is howling through the trees. Glass lies beneath a
          cluster of brush... shivering... bleeding. Every aching
          breath creates a puff of smoke in the cold, night air.
           39.
                         
                         
          EXT. MARSH - DAY
                         
          Thick with a sea of four-foot high Cattails... like miniature
          cornstalks. Looking down from above the marsh we see a two-
          foot wide path of crushed plants that reaches the center of
          the marsh, and stops.
                         
          We tighten on the end of the path, until we see Glass lying
          among the Cattails. He's sawing off one of the stalks with
          the straight razor... peeling away the husk, and eating the
          tender flesh beneath.
                         
          Mosquitoes move in clouds around him... over his face...
          arms. But Glass' injured body only allows him one action at
          a time, so the mosquitoes have their fill of him, as he gnaws
          on the Cattail.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass pulling himself along the ground... stopping to tear a
          FEW BERRIES from a plant, and shove them in his mouth. He
          flinches as he swallows. He starts to move again, but
          freezes... listens... RUSHING WATER.
                         
          Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy...
          pulls himself toward the sound... up over a ridge... and
          there it is at the bottom of the ridge...
                         
          ...THE GRAND RIVER... WATER. Glass crawls down toward it.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Glass drags himself to the river's edge, cupping handfuls of
          water and rubbing it over his parched lips... withstanding
          the pain to gulp it down.
                         
          As he does, Glass notices a FISH hovering in the shallows
          beside him. He makes a desperate grab for the fish, but it
          darts easily away.
                         
          Glass cups more water to his mouth, but with each drink, he
          feels the water leak from a hole in his throat... run down
          his neck. He leans out over the surface to check his
          reflection... barely recognizes the swollen, stitched-
          together, disfigured face staring back at him. He fights off
          the urge to vomit... pulls the razor from the leather bag,
          and cuts more strips of blanket, soaking them in the river,
          then cleaning his wounds.
           40.
                         
          He runs a finger up to his shredded throat... around the
          open, wet hole. He cups another handful of water to his
          mouth... strains to swallow, then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT
          OF THE HOLE.
                         
          Glass shoves the cloth against the wound... tries to press
          the flesh together... no good. He dumps out his Possibles
          bag... stares at the meager contents. He picks up one of the
          flints... looks to the powderhorn.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
                         
          ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS...
                         
          ...as Glass SPARKS one of the flints... ignites the grass.
          As the fire grows, Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from
          the horn, and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT.
                         
          He lifts several small blades of burning grass... a miniature
          torch. And only then do we realize what he's about to do...
          because he stares at the flame a beat, then raises it toward
          his gunpowder-covered throat.
                         
          The flame nears the black powder, and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS,
          igniting the powder, and SETTING GLASS'S NECK ON FIRE.
                         
          Glass falls back to the ground in agony... TRIES TO SCREAM,
          but his burning, shredded vocal chords won't allow him.
                         
          The gunpowder sizzles and burns... the flame spreads...
          Glass' flesh sears... melts. And the pain is too much for
          Glass... he passes out.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS... looking dead beside the river, but we know
          he's alive because we can hear those same painful, raspy
          breaths.
                         
          And then we hear something else... an O.S. RATTLING, growing
          LOUDER... FASTER... BUZZING... until Glass' eyes flash open.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON A RATTLESNAKE COILED INCHES FROM HIS FACE.
                         
          Glass stares back in horror... has time to throw up his arm
          in protection as the snake STRIKES... SINKS ITS FANGS INTO
          HIS FOREARM.
           41.
          He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next
          strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. Glass
          opens his mouth to scream.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          And Glass' eyes flying open in the glaring sun, as he awakens
          from his nightmare... looks to his arm... no snake. His hand
          instinctively jumps to his melted throat. No bites.
                         
          But that's when he hears it... we all do... that same
          RATTLING FROM HIS DREAM. Glass slowly turns his head toward
          the sound...
                         
          ...and there's a RATTLESNAKE COILED just a few feet away.
          Only it isn't poised to attack Glass. It's facing the other
          way, its target a FIELD MOUSE, trapped against a rock.
                         
          The snake attacks, sinking its fangs into the mouse. The
          field mouse tumbles over... quivers as the poison runs
          through its body, then dies.
                         
          As Glass watches the snake begin to make a meal of the mouse,
          his hand grips a rock. He drags himself toward the occupied
          snake... raises the rock high, then SMASHES IT DOWN ON THE
          SNAKE'S HEAD.
                         
          Glass immediately pulls the razor from his bag, and slices
          off the rattlesnake's head, the field mouse still lodged
          halfway inside. Glass then drags the razor down the length
          of the snake... digs his fingers under the fresh seam, then
          peels the outer layer down off the rattler.
                         
          With the skin still hanging off the round tube of flesh,
          Glass BITES INTO THE SNAKE, tearing off a chunk of meat. He
          gobbles it down, slowing only to painfully swallow the food
          past his injured throat.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - LATER
                         
          ANGLE ON THE REMAINS OF THE SNAKE...
                         
          ...the head, skin, and not much else.
                         
          GLASS - at the water's edge, drinking... touching his
          charred, melted throat... no leaks. He opens his Possibles
          bag... pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW NECKLACE... stares at it a
          beat, then slips it over his head.
           42.
                         
          He drags out the map... spreads it on the ground, then throws
          a glance around him... fingers the point on the blue line...
          a rough guess of his location.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE MAP...
                         
          ...Fort Union at the top... hundreds of miles north. Fort
          Brazeau south... but not nearly as far away.
                         
          Glass gazes north up the Grand, as if he can see Fitzgerald
          and Bridger just ahead of him. Then he looks back down to
          his reflection in the water... battered and scarred. He
          looks to his leg... all but worthless for now... his one good
          arm. It's clear he's not ready to take revenge on anyone.
                         
          So Glass shoves the map back into the bag... ties it around
          his arm with the powderhorn and blanket, then grabs a THICK,
          FALLEN LOG, and rolls it into the river. Glass crawls in
          behind it... deeper, until the current grows strong enough to
          carry the weight of his mangled body downstream.
                         
          Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log, and starts
          floating... letting the river do the work. He watches the
          land move past him faster than it has in days... and without
          all the agony of every move.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Winding through the open prairie. Glass hangs onto the
          log... floats with the gentle current.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - EVENING
                         
          The sinking sun casts an orange glow over the water. Glass
          floats downstream... past a HERD OF ELK grazing along the
          riverbank. The animals don't even notice him.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Dark... the moon hidden behind clouds. A heavy mist hangs
          over the river. Glass is draped across the log, eyes
          closed... letting the slow current carry him south. But then
          his eyes open... because he hears something... a LOW RUMBLE.
                         
          Glass looks to the river banks... too foggy to see anything
          clearly. The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER. He peers ahead... too
          dark to see much... just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in
          front of him, its one jagged branch rising up in the air.
           43.
                         
          But then THE LOG VANISHES. Glass squints through the fog,
          scanning the surface. But it's gone... the water's empty...
          that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER.
                         
          Glass looks to the water beside him... a BRANCH GLIDES PAST
          AT A HIGHER SPEED. And now Glass knows what's coming, but
          it's too late... because the world suddenly turns upside
          down, as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT
          WATERFALL.
                         
          He spirals downward... crashes into the rushing current.
          He's washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids. They
          pull him under the surface, then toss him GASPING back out.
                         
          The river carries him blindly through the mist... tossing...
          turning... SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER... CRACK... he
          spins off, swept away headfirst... the foaming water sucking
          him down the rocky gauntlet.
                         
          He tumbles over more boulders... his Possibles bag snaps
          loose... Glass makes a grab for it, but is suddenly flipped
          down another set of falls.
                         
          The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river.
                         
          Glass sinks beneath the surface, then floats back up, as the
          rapids calm... spit Glass to the gentle shallows. His body
          drifts face-down toward shore.
                         
          And just when we're sure Glass has to finally be dead, his
          arm reaches up from the water... he digs his fingers into the
          muddy bank, and drags himself out of the river.
                         
          Glass collapses unconscious to the ground, his body shrouded
          in that mist.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS' FACE... the right still
          pressed into the muddy bank. The sun beats down... then
          SHADOWS APPEAR... BOUNCE ACROSS HIM... something is standing
          over Glass.
                         
          And then a VULTURE'S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME...
                         
          ...latches its beak onto Glass' cheek... tugs at it...
          stretches it. Glass' eyes pop open... we PULL BACK to see
          THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass' body, pecking and clawing
          at his battered wounds.
           44.
                         
          Glass swings his good arm, knocking one of the vultures away.
          He tries to cry out, but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from
          his throat.
                         
          The vultures dance away from his flailing... aren't willing
          to give up their meal so easily... dart in for quick attacks
          on his flesh.
                         
          Glass grasps a branch... swings at the birds, beating them
          back. The vultures give up the battle... fly away.
                         
          Glass crumbles back to the ground... squints up into the
          sun... the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM...
          waiting for him to die.
                         
          Glass looks down to his wounds, again oozing blood. He
          glances around... sees a ridge just a few hundred yards away.
                         
          At the base of the ridge, a GIANT BOULDER has broken free,
          creating a partial cave. Glass starts crawling toward it.
          And if it's possible, he looks even closer to death now than
          when he started this journey.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          No more than ten feet deep, but enough to hide from
          predators. Glass drags himself as far back in the recess as
          he can... collapses against the rock wall.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile...
          begins sparking rocks together to build a fire.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - LATER
                         
          The fire burns beside Glass, as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of
          cloth from the tattered blanket, then feeds it through a tiny
          hole in a JAGGED, NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK... a
          man-made needle and thread.
                         
          Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest...
          piercing his skin with the rock... wincing with pain as he
          tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin... pierces
          the other side of the wound, then pulls the flesh tightly
          together... before repeating the excruciating process all
          over again... pierce... pull... pierce... tighten.
           45.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          The moon's glow reflects off the water.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS' HAND...
                         
          ...holding a small sharp stone, and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO
          THE CAVE'S ROCK WALL.
                         
          WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND... still listening to the
          SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt... reach
          the fire... its flame warm and strong. We TIGHTEN ON THE
          FIRE, until WE'RE INSIDE IT... and then WE PULL BACK...
                         
          ...and we see the fire has long died away... just black ash.
          The O.S. SCRATCHING has silenced. We glide back across the
          cave floor... to Glass unconscious on the ground. And above
          him on the wall, we see what he had been scratching...
                         
          "Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald and Bridger. If find
          eether kill for Hugh Glass"
                         
          We hold on those words a beat, then...
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface. THUNDER RUMBLES... the rain
          grows heavier.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          Rain pouring... gullies of water run down the ridge, spewing
          over the mouth of the cave. But inside, Glass doesn't
          stir... lying there just as we last saw him.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Rain coming down in buckets. The river's raging.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Clouds drift across the moon... the storm has ended.
           46.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          Sunny and clear. A rabbit hops along... stops for a moment
          outside the cave. Beyond it, Glass is still sprawled on the
          cave floor... he must be dead. The rabbit continues on past.
                         
                         
          INT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          TIGHT ON GLASS' FACE... as his eyes flutter open. He stares
          straight ahead, unmoving.
                         
                         
          EXT. CAVE - DAY
                         
          Glass crawls out of the crevice... shields his eyes from the
          sun, as he takes in the scene.
                         
          The river has sunk back to normal, leaving the banks battered
          and muddy. The water is thick and brown with all the flooded
          earth it pulled up.
                         
          Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees, then
          higher... onto his healthy leg. He braces himself against a
          tree. He's still crooked and hunched over, but for the first
          time since the Grizzly attack, he looks more like a man than
          an animal. He bends down... picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          Glass limps along the bank... beside the brown water stirred
          up from the flood. He moves along the washed-out area,
          searching for food... grabs some plants... tears them from
          the ground to chew on the roots.
                         
          He continues on... spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in
          the flood, frozen on its back. Glass kneels down to pick up
          the turtle... sniffs it. As he does, he spots something
          across the river... a DEER, staring back at him.
                         
          Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE... takes careful aim
          at the deer... pulls the trigger. If only he had his Anstadt.
                         
          But then the deer's head snaps... to something beyond Glass.
          Glass follows the animal's eyes... turns to the ridge... and
          the FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS' CAVE.
                         
          Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the
          flood. He looks back across the river... THE DEER IS LONG
          GONE.
           47.
                         
          Glass inches his head up over the tree... to the warriors now
          crouched outside the cave... studying the tracks.
                         
          Glass' eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river... HIS
          FOOTPRINTS CLEAR... an obvious trail leading right to him.
          He throws a glance around... nowhere to run even if he could.
          So he starts backing into the river on his stomach... feet-
          first... dragging a small branch over the tracks around him,
          wiping them away as he moves. And his eyes are locked on the
          Arikara... watching to see if they spot him.
                         
          But they haven't yet, and Glass keeps sliding backward...
          five feet off shore... only three feet deep in the murky
          water and sludge. But if he goes any further, the current
          will catch him... pull him into the next set of violent
          rapids... and make him a clear target.
                         
          The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave.
                         
          Glass sinks neck-deep into the water... the Arikara keep
          coming... near the river. So Glass drops beneath the surface.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         UNDERWATER -
                         
          And Glass' eyes spread wide... searching the muddy water. He
          grabs a LARGE ROCK... rolls onto his back, and places the
          rock on his stomach, its weight holding him firmly to the
          river bottom.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - DAY
                         
          ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS... following Glass' tracks to
          the edge of the river... looking out over the brown river.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
                         UNDERWATER -
                         
          Glass pressing his head back against the bottom... staring up
          through the cloudy water... to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY
          A FEW FEET AWAY.
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The Arikara... unknowingly standing just above Glass...
          looking back to the tracks... scanning the water. But the
          surface is empty, and the river's too thick with mud to see
          anything below.
           48.
                         
          But they keep looking... and we're waiting for Glass to
          explode from the river, gasping for air. But he doesn't...
          and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity, until
          finally, the warriors turn... start walking back up the path.
                         
          Behind them, Glass' face inches to the surface... pulls in
          some oxygen... watches as they fade into the trees.
                         
          Then Glass rolls the rock away... starts moving deeper into
          the river... fighting the current to grab rocks and
          boulders... pulling himself to the other side.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass limps through the trees, still dripping with the muddy
          water of the Grand.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - LATER
                         
          Glass is on his knees, desperately grabbing for a TINY FIELD
          MOUSE. The rodent escapes into a hole. Glass claws at the
          ground after it. He's starving to death.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          The rain beating down through the trees. Glass huddles in a
          cluster of bushes, trying to stay dry... shivering in the
          cold. He reaches out from the cover, grabbing his moccasin
          boot standing in the rain. He pulls it in... slurps back the
          rainfall that it's caught.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE - EVENING
                         
          Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie. He's weak...
          starving... isn't going to make it much further. He drops to
          his hands and knees.
                         
          And then he feels something... the ground almost trembling
          under his hands. He watches his hands quiver with vibration.
          A RUMBLE BUILDS. Glass strains to hear... looks to the crest
          of a hill... labors up the gentle slope toward the sound.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE/HILL - EVENING
                         
          Glass reaches the crest... looks over the other side to a
          HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE.
           49.
                         
          An incredible site... hundreds of massive creatures... their
          hooves tearing up the earth, leaving a cloud of dust behind
          them.
                         
          Behind the herd, a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN
          BUFFALO.
                         
          Glass lies in the high grass, watching the wolves SNARL AND
          SNAP over the remains. And he eyes that buffalo... the
          closest he's been to food in days.
                         
                         
          EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT
                         
          The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo, their snouts
          bloody from the meal. Suddenly, one of the wolves' heads
          snaps up... bares its teeth... SNARLS.
                         
          And then we see what the wolf is growling at... Glass...
          limping out of the shadows toward the animals, holding a
          BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND... like giant FLAMING HANDS
          clawing in the night.
                         
          The wolves jump to their feet, unsure of what's approaching.
          They growl at Glass. But Glass keeps coming... doing his
          best to YELL... more like GROWL back at the wolves. He
          swings the flaming brush, tossing glowing sparks through the
          air.
                         
          The wolves spread out, instinctively surrounding Glass. But
          Glass singles out each one... charges, waving the flames...
          driving each wolf back.
                         
          Four of the wolves back away, but the leader holds its
          ground... even moves toward Glass... only a few feet away...
          SNARLING... bloody jaws ready to attack, but still not sure
          what its up against.
                         
          Glass shakes the flames at the wolf... it SNAPS AT GLASS'
          ARM. Glass swings the other... slams the fiery plant across
          the wolf's head.
                         
          The wolf YELPS... leaps back... starts to run away, but turns
          back... makes another charge at Glass. But Glass is ready...
          throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf, then clubs it
          with the other. The animal's fur begins to burn.
                         
          The frightened wolf has had enough... rolls on the ground,
          then spins to join the rest of its pack. They run a safe
          distance, then stop... keeping a watch on Glass.
           50.
                         
          Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground,
          igniting the grass and brush... creating a foot-high flaming
          wall between him and the wolves.
                         
          He stretches the flame into a circle, a fiery ring surrounds
          the fallen buffalo.
                         
          The wolves have seen enough... turn... race away from the
          flames.
                         
          As the grass around him burns, Glass drops the sage plants...
          attacks the buffalo remains, tearing away bloody chunks of
          flesh from the carcass, and shoving them into his mouth... a
          starving animal that's finally found food.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT
                         
          From high above the prairie... Glass and the buffalo at the
          center of that glowing ring of fire.
                         
                         
          EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY
                         
          The wind's gusting... bending the high golden grass over on
          its side. Glass moves slowly across, pulling his collar up
          to shield his face from the cold winds. He spots something
          in the distant sky ahead... a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE.
          Glass picks up his pace... hope spurring him on.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          The charred, skeletal remains of a tribe's village... just
          black posts where tee-pees once stood... a half-burned log
          lodge still smokes, sending that black line into the sky.
                         
          Glass limps through the graveyard of structures... all signs
          of life in this village long gone. He searches a basket...
          pulls out a BLANKET... wraps it around his shoulders.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE - DAY
                         
          Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge... black and
          empty. He slides down to the floor... unwraps strips of
          roasted buffalo from what's left of his blanket. He starts to
          take a bite, when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE
          BACK ROOM. The O.S. SHUFFLING OF FEET.
                         
          Glass freezes... he isn't alone. He rises... grabs a
          splintered post like a spear... eases toward the doorway...
          raises the post to swing...
           51.
                         
          ...and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room. The
          dog takes off around a crumbled wall. Glass follows it.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Glass limps across the room... turns the corner of the
          crumbled wall... and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an
          ANCIENT ARIKARA SQUAW, huddled in the corner, her bony arms
          outstretched in front of her in weak defense. And her eyes
          are SOLID WHITE... the old woman is blind. She CRIES OUT A
          CHANT over and over... her death chant, as she waits for this
          stranger to kill her.
                         
          Glass stands frozen... confused. He tries to speak, but his
          throat still won't let him. He crouches down in front of the
          old woman... reaches for her hand, but she flails him away.
          He grabs her again... gently... just holds it until she
          calms... studying the woman... her hollow face all skin and
          bones... she's obviously dying.
                         
          He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket... pushes
          it into the squaw's hand. She immediately jerks it to her
          mouth... and that's when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH...
          she can't eat.
                         
          Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream. The dog
          scurries out behind him... follows Glass to the water.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE/BACK ROOM - DAY
                         
          The pot boils over burning logs. Glass dips a cup in,
          pulling out a warm broth. He carries it to the squaw, still
          sitting in the corner... takes her hand, placing the cup in
          it for her. She gulps the liquid back.
                         
          Glass goes back to refill the cup. The old woman MUMBLES
          SOMETHING we can't understand... over and over, as Glass
          brings the cup back to her. He tries to ease it into her
          hand, but the woman pushes it away... slides her hand up
          Glass' arm to his face... patting it... MUMBLING THOSE SAME
          WORDS... thanking Glass.
           52.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING
                         
          Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge. The puppy
          trails behind him, biting at one of the corners... hanging on
          as Glass pulls him across the dirt.
                         
                         
          INT. LODGE - EVENING
                         
          Glass enters the back room with the blankets... stops when he
          sees the old woman slumped over to the floor, her white eyes
          frozen open in a lifeless stare.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at
          the edge of the village. The squaw lies atop the pyre,
          covered in the blankets he gathered for her. Glass stands
          beside the pyre, a FLAMING TORCH in his hand. The puppy
          rests at his feet.
                         
                         
          EXT. DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          THREE INDIANS sit on horseback, watching Glass light the
          pyre... the flames rise into the night.
                         
                         
          EXT. BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass crouches... pets the dog, as he watches the flames
          spread... engulf the woman.
                         
          ANGLE ON THE GLOWING EMBERS...
                         
          ...floating into the night. Beyond the sparks, we see
          something else... THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE
          VILLAGE... FAST.
                         
          And now Glass sees them too... knows it's too late to run, so
          he just stands there. But the dog's seen enough... darts
          away.
                         
          Glass watches the Indians ride into the village... their
          braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we've
          seen earlier, because these are SIOUX WARRIORS, and Glass
          knows it.
                         
          The Sioux surround Glass on horseback... stare down at Glass.
          The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE), (30's), poised and strong,
          points to the flaming pyre... says something to Glass.
           53.
                         
          Glass tries to answer... can't... touches his scarred throat.
          Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse. The other two
          warriors, (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same...
          close in on Glass.
                         
          Glass stands firm. Spotted Horse says something else to him.
          Again, Glass touches his throat... holds his jacket out from
          his sides... no weapons. Spotted Horse studies Glass hard...
          reaches out, wiping his finger down Glass' cheek, almost
          testing to see if the color comes off.
                         
          One of the other warriors pats Glass' hair... smiles... says
          something to the others. Spotted Horse and the other warrior
          join him, each touching Glass' hair.
                         
          Then Spotted Horse spots Glass' necklace... the grizzly claw
          hanging from it. He examines the enormous claw, then nods to
          Glass' stitching and scars.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Griz-lee.
                         
          Glass hears the familiar word... nods. Three Feathers pulls
          a WHITE SPECK from the back of Glass' neck... holds it up to
          Spotted Horse.
                         
          Spotted Horse jerks out his knife. Glass is confused...
          holds up his hand, as he takes a step back. But Three
          Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass... secure him... pull his
          jacket down off his shoulders, exposing his shirt, as Spotted
          Horse walks around behind Glass... raises the knife... Glass
          GROWLS A PLEA... but Spotted Horse slices the knife down
          Glass' back... just cutting open his shirt... and revealing a
          MASS OF WHITE WORMS... MAGGOTS... COVERING THE DEEP GASHES ON
          GLASS' BACK.
                         
          The three warriors exchange glances... they've obviously
          never seen anything like this. Glass sees their reaction...
          throws a nervous glance... what?
                         
          Three Feathers runs his hand across Glass' back, dragging a
          HANDFUL OF WORMS for Glass to see. As Glass' eyes widen in
          panic, Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE against
          Glass' head.
                         
          Glass drops to his knees... makes a dazed grab for Spotted
          Horse... misses... and Spotted Horse HITS GLASS AGAIN. Glass
          tumbles unconscious to the dirt.
                         
          Spotted Horse says something to the others... they grab
          Glass' limp arms... drag him toward the horses.
           54.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie, along with a sea
          of tee-pees, their willow poles fanning against the night
          sky. Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various
          tee-pees and lodges. SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the
          village... freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other
          riders splash across the stream.
                         
          The warriors ride into the village, Glass' body tossed over
          the back of Three Feather's horse. The children race to them.
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS... regaining consciousness... eyes blinking...
          trying to focus.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE...
                         
          ...to the children's eager faces swarming around him...
          studying this strange face.
                         
          Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children... they
          back away from Glass... fall into line behind the riders.
                         
          Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past... to
          a tee-pee set away from the rest... its hide walls decorated
          with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human
          figures circling the sun.
                         
          An OLD MEDICINE MAN, gnarled and leathery, a DEAD RAVEN tied
          in his long hair, his naked chest painted with red and black
          stripes, steps out of the tee-pee. He eyes Glass, as Three
          Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside.
                         
          Suddenly, the Medicine Man begins CHANTING.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN'S V.O.
          CHANTING...
                         
          LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS' WRISTS AND ANKLES...
          stretched tight.
                         
          Glass, naked, on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee,
          his arms and legs outstretched, secured to wooden stakes in
          the ground. The white worms cover his back.
           55.
                         
          The Medicine Man... CHANTING... waving burning sticks in the
          air.
                         
          A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT... the Medicine Man's twisted
          hand reaching a gourd container in... filling it with the
          steaming mixture.
                         
          The liquid POURING OVER GLASS' BACK.
                         
          GLASS' FACE... arched to the sky... twisted in horrible pain.
          He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY.
                         
          MORE IMAGES... even faster... the CHANTING more frantic...
                         
          A SIOUX WOMAN,(WAKI), staring down.
                         
          HANDS wiping a GREEN SLUDGE over Glass' neck... chest.
                         
          The Medicine Man dancing... chanting... shaking sticks lined
          with RATTLESNAKE TAILS.
                         
          The moonlight shining through the tee-pee, illuminating the
          images of the buffalo and dancing shapes.
                         
          Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass' mouth.
                         
          The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE...
          lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass' throat.
                         
          GLASS' EYES... wide open... rolling up white into his head.
                         
          AND THE CHANTING STOPS... the world goes dark.
                         
                         
          EXT. YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY
                         
          Cutting through the open prairie. Snow-covered peaks touch
          the sky in the distance.
                         
          Fitzgerald and Bridger trudge their way across the prairie,
          dressed in furs. They rise up a steep slope... reach the
          top, and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a massive
          thirty-foot tall wooden fence. Fort Union.
                         
          Bridger smiles... relieved.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           `Bout goddamn time.
                         
          They start down the slope. Fitzgerald grabs Bridger's arm...
          firmly.
           56.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           And we're understood on
           everything... Glass' dyin' in his
           sleep... us buryin' him like was
           agreed.
                         
          Bridger doesn't respond. Fitzgerald doesn't like that.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You're as guilty as me in leavin'
           him. Don't you forget that. You
           got a future up here. No sense
           tossin' it away when he was as good
           as dead already. Shit, all we did
           was skip the funeral.
                         
          Bridger pulls his arm free... continues on.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           I won't take to givin' up that two-
           hundred on accounta you gettin'
           weak-kneed.
                         
          Bridger keeps walking. Fitzgerald follows behind.
                         
                         
          INT. FORT UNION - DAY
                         
          Like a small town surrounded by a log wall. The main TRADING
          POST BUILDING is busy... TRAPPERS, SIOUX, all with things to
          trade. But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next
          door... crowded with customers downstairs, and just as busy
          in the whores' rooms upstairs.
                         
          A small village of tents rests off to the side of the
          buildings, holding the overflow of traffic.
                         
                         
          INT. SALOON - DAY
                         
          Fitzgerald and Bridger enter the crowded room... squeeze
          their way to the bar.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Twice the folks here than when we
           left.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           We should go see Captain Henry.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Far as we hiked... we got time for
           a drink on the company's tab.
           57.
                         
           PIG (O.S.)
           Jim!
                         
          They spin... see Pig, Murphy and Stubby Bill sitting at a
          table. Pig scrambles up... rushes to Bridger, locking him in
          a big bear hug.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           You made it! I was scared the `Ree
           mighta caught up to ya.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           If your fat ass could get through,
           we didn't have no worries.
                         
          Pig glares at Fitzgerald... watches him walk to the table,
          joining the others.
                         
                          PIG
           (off Fitzgerald, to
                          BRIDGER)
           Had to be a helluva long walk for
           you.
                         
          Bridger nods... Pig has no idea.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Hugh?
                         
          Bridger hesitates a beat, then just shakes his head.
                         
                          PIG (CONT'D)
           Guess we all knowed how it would
           turn out. Did he suffer much more?
                         
          Another long beat, then...
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I hope not.
                         
          A PROSTITUTE walks down the stairs... stops on the landing,
          waiting for her next customer. Fitzgerald spots her...
          grins.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (TO BRIDGER)
           Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I
           just got a itch to spend the first
           of my two-hundred.
                         
          The other men laugh. Not Bridger.
           58.
                         
                         
          INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Henry sits at his desk. Fitzgerald and Bridger stand across
          from him. The others... Pig, Anderson, Murphy, and Stubby
          Bill crowd the room behind them.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I won't pretend to been his friend,
           but I respect any man that fights
           the way he done.
                         
                          HENRY
           And the grave?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           We had those extra days so we went
           deeper... covered it in rocks. To
           keep the scavengers off him.
                         
                          HENRY
           Any sign of hostiles?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Not a one.
                         
          The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger. He can't
          take the pain... opens his mouth to speak, but Fitzgerald
          beats him to it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           Truth is, I was worried `bout `Ree,
           and ready to get movin', but
           Bridger here argued to stay and
           make a cross for the grave.
                         
          Bridger's head snaps to Fitzgerald... don't make this worse.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           So that's what we did.
                         
          Pig reaches up... gives Bridger a pat on the back. But to
          Bridger, it feels like a red-hot blade.
                         
                          HENRY
           Glad to hear you pulled your
           weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you
           would.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           More than his share, Captain.
           59.
                         
          And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie. Bridger
          drops his eyes to his feet.
                         
                          HENRY
           Speaking of shares.
                         
          Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall. Fitzgerald
          watches as Henry spins the dial... locks in the combination,
          then pulls the latch. The safe door swings open...
                         
          ...revealing STACKS OF CASH.
                         
          Fitzgerald's eyes lock on all that money. Henry pulls out a
          handful... starts counting them out onto the desk.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           Am I to assume the agreed
           arrangement didn't change?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Fortunate for me, it did not.
                         
                          HENRY
           Well thank you both for your
           courage and honor. You have done
           yourselves proud.
                         
          Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills. Henry drops a couple
          bills in front of Bridger.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           You're owed something for what you
           did.
                         
          Bridger stares down at the bills a beat, then snatches
          them... pushes his way out of the office before he might have
          to look someone in the eye.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           He's beat hisself up most of the
           trip... wishin' he'da done more.
                         
                          HENRY
           We all saw the shape Glass was in.
           There was no more to be done.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That's what I been tellin' him.
           60.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY
                         
          Empty, except for Bridger curled up on his cot, squeezing
          those crumpled bills in his hand, crying.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          INT. TEE-PEE - DAY
                         
          Glass sleeps under a buffalo robe. His eyes flicker open.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS' POV - ON THE BUFFALO AND DANCING FIGURE DESIGNS
          SHADOWED THROUGH THE TEE-PEE.
                         
          GLASS - His hand reaching up to his throat. It looks much
          better than we last saw. And the stitches are gone from his
          face, now just long, pink scars. He stiffly raises himself
          up... remembers his back... struggles to reach behind him...
          scarred but clean... no maggots.
                         
          He looks beside him... sees BUCKSKIN PANTS AND SHIRT resting
          on the ground... waiting for him.
                         
                         
          EXT. TEE-PEE - DAY
                         
          ANGLE ON GLASS... dressed... pushing his way out through the
          flap of the tee-pee... limping out into the midday sun, and
          shielding his eyes. He looks like a man that hasn't seen the
          light of day for weeks.
                         
          Glass adjusts to the brightness... stares in wonder at the
          scene.
                         
          And then we see what Glass is looking at, and understand his
          reaction... the entire village is blanketed in snow. The
          Sioux VILLAGERS move about, wearing heavy skins and furs.
                         
          A WOMEN'S O.S. VOICE turns Glass...
                         
          ...to WAKI, the woman from the images, walking toward him,
          bundled in fur. She says something else we can't
          understand... points to Glass' feet. Glass looks down... to
          his BARE FEET BURIED DEEP IN THE SNOW. He hadn't noticed.
                         
          And then Waki smiles... a sweet, pretty smile. She takes his
          hand... leads him back into the tee-pee.
           61.
                         
                         
          INT. TEE-PEE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Glass and Waki enter. She pulls a pair of moccasins from a
          basket... hands them to Glass.
                         
          He slips them on, then presses his fingers against his
          throat... almost trying to hold it all inside to make it
          work, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           (scratching and rough)
           Thank you.
                         
          Waki doesn't understand... just raises a cup of liquid...
          says something, then touches his throat... motions for him to
          drink. Glass sips the drink... grimaces... shakes his head,
          trying to give the cup back, but Waki refuses... points at
          his throat, and motions for him to drink. Glass stares in
          the cup a beat, then gulps it back... shakes his head.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Bad medicine.
                         
          Waki smiles... hands him his BEAR CLAW NECKLACE. Glass nods
          in thanks, then achingly lifts his arms up to slip it over
          his head.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           How long have I been here?
                         
          Waki just stares back... no idea what Glass said.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           You're Sioux. I only know a bit a
           Pawnee.
                         
          Glass stumbles through a sentence of Pawnee. Waki shakes her
          head... throws a jumble of Sioux back at him.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           The snow... my healin'.
           (points to himself)
           Me.
           (points to the ground)
           Here. How long?
                         
          Waki shakes her head again. Glass leads her outside.
           62.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Glass points to the sun overhead, then raises both hands,
          fingers outstretched.
                         
                          GLASS
           How many suns? Ten?
                         
          Waki studies Glass... the sun... begins to understand. She
          nods... SAYS A WORD... holds up all ten of her fingers.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Ten suns?
                         
          Then Waki closes her hands into fists... opens them again...
          closes them again... SAYS A DIFFERENT WORD.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Christ.
                         
          Glass glances around... for the first time, notices Sioux MEN
          and WOMEN staring at him. Children freeze in the middle of
          their play... all eyes locked on Glass. TWO SMALL BOYS, (NEW
          MOON and LITTLE ONE), repeat the same TWO WORDS to each
          other...
                         
                          BOYS
           Tatanka Wicasa.
                         
          ...over and over.
                         
          Glass stares back, unsure. Then...
                         
           SPOTTED HORSE (O.S.)
           Buff-A-lo Man.
                         
          Glass turns... sees Yellow Horse stepping out of a tee-pee.
                         
           Spotted Horse (cont'd)
           (very broken english)
           What they call you.
           (points to Glass' hair)
           Fur of Buff-A-lo.
                         
          Glass touches his hair... nods... smiles. The children smile
          and laugh now too... repeat the words LOUDER.
                         
                          GLASS
           You speak English.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Need words when trade with whites.
           63.
                         
                          GLASS
           Well I'm grateful for you bringing
           me here... havin' them care for me.
           (off Spotted Horse's nod)
           Now if you could point me which way
           it is you do your tradin'... with
           the whites.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
                          (POINTS)
           Whites. Bra-zo.
                         
                          GLASS
           Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm
           tryin' to get. Is it far from here?
                         
          Spotted Horse doesn't understand. Glass motions into the
          distance.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Far? Long way?
                         
          Spotted Horse points to a horse, then holds up three fingers.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Three days on horse?
                         
          Spotted Horse nods... looks Glass over, and shakes his head.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Not walk. Hides soon.
                         
          Glass doesn't understand... until Spotted Horse points to a
          ROW OF BUFFALO HIDES hanging from a line.
                         
           Spotted Horse (cont'd)
           We trade Bra-zo.
                         
          Glass stares at the tanning hides, then down at his leg.
          Finally, he nods. Spotted Horse starts walking... waves for
          Glass to follow.
                         
           Spotted Horse (cont'd)
           Come. Eat.
                         
          Glass follows after him. The children sneak in behind,
          giggling as they tail Glass across camp.
                         
          Glass glances back... New Moon and Little One duck behind a
          tee-pee... wait for him to continue before they scoot back
          out after him.
           64.
                         
                         
          INT. CHIEF'S LODGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass, Spotted Horse, Three Feathers, Running Fox and OTHER
          WARRIORS sit around a fire, eating with CHIEF RED HAWK, the
          Medicine Man, and several other TRIBAL ELDERS.
                         
                          GLASS
           The men stole my rifle.
                         
          The Sioux don't understand. Glass reaches over, taking
          Spotted Horse's plate.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           They took. They took...
                         
          Glass aims an imaginary rifle.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           ...my rifle. My gear.
                         
          Now Spotted Horse understands... translates for the others.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           They left me to die. So I mean to
           find `em both. Get my rifle back.
                         
          Spotted Horse translates again. Red Hawk nods, studying
          Glass.
                         
          Red Hawk SAYS SOMETHING to Glass... motions to the BEAR CLAW
          NECKLACE. Glass looks to Spotted Horse.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee.
                         
          Glass touches his chest. Red Hawk nods, impressed. Glass
          points to the JAGGED SCARS running up Red Hawk's neck to a
          MISSING RIGHT EAR.
                         
                          GLASS
           Grizzly?
                         
          Red Hawk smiles... shakes his head.
                         
                          RED HAWK
           Arikara.
                         
          That word, Glass understands. Red Hawk rambles a long
          sentence in Sioux. The other members LAUGH.
           65.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           He say Arikara take right ear of
           Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not
           know what they take from you.
                         
          Glass smiles along with the others. They continue their meal.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Snow falls over Glass, as he stands outside the tee-pee,
          flexing his injured leg... putting more weight on it...
          testing its recovered strength.
                         
          Suddenly, a SPEAR PLANTS INTO THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS FEET.
          Glass turns, startled... sees Spotted Horse, Three Feathers,
          Running Fox, and several OTHER WARRIORS staring at him.
                         
          Glass' eyes jump from the spear to the warriors, unsure.
                         
          Spotted Horse strides to Glass... grabs the spear, then spins
          it sideways... stares at Glass, until a smile spreads across
          Spotted Horse's face... he holds the spear out to Glass.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux?
                         
          Glass relaxes... nods... takes the spear from Spotted Horse.
          Three Feathers hands a BUFFALO HIDE to Glass... motions for
          Glass to put it on.
                         
                          THREE FEATHERS
           Tatanka Wicasa.
                         
          Glass wraps the hide around him. The Warriors smile and nod.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          A world of silent white... like we're inside a giant snow-
          globe. The sky is emptying all the snow it has over us...
          pouring down... the only sound comes from the flakes hitting
          the already fallen snow. The pale trunks of Cottonwoods rise
          up from the white ground.
                         
          Then out of the white... a SHAPE APPEARS... a GIANT WOLF
          WALKING ON ITS HIND LEGS. But as the wolf comes closer, we
          see it's not a wolf at all... it's THREE FEATHERS, wearing
          his WOLF SKIN. He CRIES OUT... HOWLING WILDLY.
                         
          A few yards beside him, another WARRIOR is doing the same...
          CHANTING... beating his spear against the Cottonwoods as he
          walks.
           66.
                         
                         
          GLASS - WEARING THE BUFFALO HIDE...
                         
          ...walking slowly through the trees, carrying the spear.
          Yellow Bear is beside him... motions for Glass to spread out.
                         
                         
          FROM ABOVE THE TREES...
                         
          ...we see the fur-covered warriors are formed into a wide
          circle... and slowly converging... YELLING... pounding their
          spears... making as much noise as possible, as they tighten
          their ring.
                         
                         
          POV FROM THE BRUSH...
                         
          ...watching DISTANT CHANTING WARRIORS pushing through the
          trees. V.O. SNORTING... our POV darts sideways... charges
          through the brush... slides to a stop when we see Running Fox
          moving toward us... spins back another direction.
                         
                         
          GLASS - MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST...
                         
          ...the falling snow clinging to his face... covering the
          buffalo hide.
                         
          And then a MASSIVE SHAPE BLASTS through the trees ahead of
          him. Glass freezes, his grip tightening on the spear. He
          looks to Spotted Horse, who nods... YELLS OUT, beating his
          spear against the trees, and motioning for Glass to do the
          same.
                         
          Glass is apprehensive at first... just lightly tapping his
          spear. But as the other warriors' chants grow, Glass gets
          caught up in the hunt... begins beating the trees... YELLING
          as loud as his throat will allow.
                         
                         
          THE WARRIORS - EYES PIERCING THROUGH THE SNOW... CHANTING...
          BEATING THE BUSHES.
                         
                         
          OUR LOW POV AGAIN - RACING CHAOTICALLY THROUGH THE BRUSH...
                         
          ...to Spotted Horse waving his spear... back over the snow...
          to Three Feathers SCREAMING... we spin again... crash through
          bushes, then suddenly TUMBLE... DROP THROUGH THE SNOW.
           67.
                         
                         
          GLASS - HEARING THE ANIMAL'S WAIL...
                         
          ...seeing Spotted Horse pick up his pace... start trotting
          forward. Glass does the same... all the hunters converging
          around a LARGE BLACK HOLE IN THE SNOW...
                         
          ...and the ELK trapped at the bottom.
                         
          The warriors cry out victoriously... begin DRIVING THEIR
          SPEARS INTO THE TRAP, killing the animal.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - EVENING
                         
          The elk roasts over a fire at the center of the village.
          Glass sits alone outside the tee-pee, using the sharp tip of
          the spear to carve into a small chunk of wood.
                         
          As he carves, New Moon and Little One sneak around the tee-
          pee behind him... watch Glass work. Glass hears them
          GIGGLING... doesn't react... just keeps carving... tilts the
          long handle of the spear as he works, tapping the side of the
          tee-pee, and SHAKING LOOSE A CLUMP OF SNOW DOWN ONTO THE
          BOYS.
                         
          The shocked boys freeze in the cold... wipe the snow from
          their faces to see Glass grinning at them. The little boys
          charge Glass, leaping onto him... wrestling him to the
          ground, as they squeeze his hair.
                         
                          BOYS
           Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa!
                         
          Spotted Horse stands across the village, watching Glass and
          the boys play in the snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass stands at the edge of the village, carving at the wood
          with the spear tip, and watching the Sioux from a distance.
          Yellow Bear sees him... approaches, carrying his SON on his
          shoulders. The little boy gnaws on a strip of meat.
                         
          Spotted Horse holds out a bowl of food to Glass.
                         
                          GLASS
           Thank you.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Good hunt.
           68.
                         
                          GLASS
           Yes.
                         
          Glass smiles up at Spotted Horse's son.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           You. Fam-i-lee?
                         
                          GLASS
           (shakes his head)
           No.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           No wom-an?
           (pointing to son)
           Wakayaja?
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           No. Not for a long time.
                         
          Glass continues eating... watches Spotted Horse bounce the
          giggling little boy on his shoulders.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - DAY
                         
          Glass steps out of his tee-pee, whittling with the spear tip.
          He glances up... freezes because he sees several Sioux
          pulling the hides from the line... rolling them up to carry.
                         
           Spotted Horse (O.S.)
           Bra-zo.
                         
          Glass turns to Spotted Horse, pointing to the hides. Glass
          nods... looks back to the last of the hides being pulled
          down... doesn't seem as excited as he once might have been.
                         
                         
          EXT. SIOUX VILLAGE - LATER
                         
          Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit atop their horses.
          Three Feathers holds the reins to another horse packed with
          hides. An empty horse stands beside them... waiting for
          Glass.
                         
          Glass is leaning over to New Moon and Little One... handing
          them the CRUDE BUFFALO CARVING he made from the wood.
                         
                          GLASS

           69.
                         
          The little boys smile. Glass nods to Waki, then waves to Red
          Hawk and the Medicine Man. They return it... watch Glass
          climb onto his horse.
                         
          Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride out of the
          village.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Glass, Spotted Horse and Three Feathers ride along a high
          ridge, surrounded by empty snow-covered wilderness. They
          have the world to themselves.

          Glass crouches over a shallow, five-foot long hole surrounded
          by deep snow. The hole is filled with small fires and rocks.
          And he's watching Spotted Horse and Three Feathers tossing
          rocks into their own matching holes, then dragging the dirt
          back into them. Spotted Horse throws a glance back to Glass,
          making sure he understands.
                         
          Glass nods... pulls the dirt back in, covering the flames.
          He watches Spotted Horse spread a blanket over the warm
          ground, then does the same. He sits on the mound of dirt...
          leans back against a tree... feels the warmth rise up from
          beneath him.
                         
          He nods to Spotted Horse, who is already resting under his
          blanket.
                         
                          GLASS
           Nice.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
                          (NODS)
           Nice.
                         
          Glass pulls the buffalo hide around himself... keeping watch.
                         
           SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd)
           Sleep. No Arikara.
                         
          Glass nods... but still doesn't close his eyes. Spotted
          Horse tosses his knife over beside Glass. Glass takes it...
          nods to Spotted Horse.
                         
           SPOTTED HORSE (cont'd)
           Me sleep.
           70.
                         
          Spotted Horse rolls over, turning his back on Glass...
          trusting him with the knife. Three Feathers does the same.
                         
          Glass just stares out into the night.
                         
                         
          INT. FORT UNION/BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Dark and quiet... except for the SNORING of a few men.
          Fitzgerald sleeps on his cot. A shadow glides across him...
          hovers over his face.
                         
          Fitzgerald's eyes blink open.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD'S POV...
                         
          ...on GLASS STANDING OVER HIM... his scarred face calm and
          deadly... raising a knife to drive down into Fitzgerald's
          chest.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           No... please.
                         
          But Glass swings the blade.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - MORNING
                         
          And Spotted Horse shaking Glass awake from his dream. Glass'
          hand flies up, the knife gripped. But Spotted Horse grabs
          his arm... stops it in mid-swing... holds it until Glass
          realizes it was a dream... relaxes.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           We go.
                         
          Glass calms... nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - DAY
                         
          Just a small cluster of log buildings sitting along the banks
          of the Missouri. Dozens of tee-pees and tents are set up
          outside the complex.
                         
          Glass follows Spotted Horse and Three Feathers into the camp.
          BEGGING INDIANS and DRUNK TRAPPERS paw at the men as they
          ride past, pleading for handouts.
           71.
                         
          One of the Indians grabs for the hides. Three Feathers
          plants his foot in the Indian's chest... shoves him back into
          the snow.
                         
          They continue on... climb off their horses outside the
          TRADING POST. Three Feathers stays to guard the hides, as
          Spotted Horse and Glass enter.
                         
                         
          INT. TRADING POST - DAY
                         
          A small, dingy room lined with shelves, all stacked high with
          pots, pans, dry goods, whiskey, blankets, weapons... anything
          that can be traded. KIOWA BRAZEAU, (60's), French-Canadian,
          stands behind the counter... looks up when the BELL over the
          door RINGS... sees Spotted Horse with Glass behind.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           (thick French accent)
           Bon jour, Spotted Horse. You come
           with many hides I hope.
           (off Spotted Horse's nod)
           We make good trades then.
                         
          Brazeau's eyes lock on Glass... stares at him, unsure.
                         
                          BRAZEAU (CONT'D)
           Monsieur Glass?
                         
                          GLASS
           Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           Jesus Christ, what happened to your
           goddamned face?
                         
                          GLASS
           Had a tussle with a grizzly.
                         
          Glass shakes Brazeau's hand. Brazeau studies his face...
          notices the Bear Claw Necklace... smiles.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           And now the grizzly, he don't look
           so good either, eh?
                         
          Glass shakes his head.
                         
                          BRAZEAU (CONT'D)
           (off Spotted Horse)
           You run with the Sioux these days?
           72.
                         
                          GLASS
           They looked after me for a spell.
           I'm on my way to catch back up with
           Captain Henry... at Fort Union.
           Needed to trade for some supplies
           on the Company's credit if I could.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           Oui, of course. Anything you like.
                         
          Glass pulls down a KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE.
                         
                          GLASS
           We can start with this.
                         
                         
          INT. TRADING POST - LATER
                         
          Glass is loaded with gear. He signs a ticket for Brazeau.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           You can pick up the horse at the
           livery in the morning.
           (off Glass' nod)
           I wish I could give you a room for
           the night, but...
                         
          Brazeau looks to SEVERAL TRAPPERS standing across the room,
          glaring at Glass.
                         
                          BRAZEAU (CONT'D)
           I cannot risk the trouble of
           letting a colored stay inside.
                         
          Glass glances to the trappers... one of them spits in Glass'
          direction... makes some MONKEY SOUNDS... daring Glass to
          respond. Glass just turns away.
                         
                          GLASS
           Won't be the last night I sleep on
           the ground.
                         
          Glass nods to Brazeau, then walks out.
                         
                          BRAZEAU
           Take care of that face, Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRADING POST - DAY
                         
          Spotted Horse and Three Feathers sit on their horses. The
          other horses are now packed with new goods. Glass
          approaches.
           73.
                         
                          GLASS
           (points to the tents)
           You stay here tonight?
                         
          Spotted Horse shakes his head... motions back toward the
          wilderness. Then he points to the trading post... the
          TRAPPERS.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           Your people?
                         
          Glass looks back to all the white faces... trappers, drunks,
          prostitutes. He shakes his head.
                         
                          GLASS
           No.
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           You come then.
                         
          Spotted Horse taps his own chest... points back the way they
          came. Glass hesitates, almost like he's considering it...
          then he shakes his head again... points the opposite way.
                         
                          GLASS
           Fort Union.
                         
          Spotted Horse stares at Glass a long beat, then...
                         
                          SPOTTED HORSE
           You spend your life hunting enemy.
           Enemy wins.
                         
                          GLASS
           It will be over soon.
                         
          Then Glass pulls the Bear Claw Necklace off... hands it to
          Spotted Horse. Spotted Horse holds it... then proudly slides
          it over his head.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
                          (IN SIOUX)
           Thank you.
                         
          Spotted Horse raises his hand in goodbye, then spins his
          horse and starts away. Three Feathers does the same. Glass
          returns it... watches them ride off.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT BRAZEAU - NIGHT
                         
          Glass is in the trees beyond the tents and tee-pees...
          crouched on the ground...
           74.
          dragging the dirt back over the fire and rocks. He slides up
          onto the mound... feels the warmth, and smiles... just a
          little.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - MORNING
                         
          Glass rides a PAINT MARE along a ridge overlooking the river.
          Fort Brazeau stands in the distance behind him.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
                         
          Snowy and cold. Glass leads the line of riders through the
          snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - EVENING
                         
          But you can't tell if it's day or night through the blizzard.
          Fitzgerald, Pig, Anderson, Bridger, Murphy and Stubby Joe
          trudge through the snow in their snowshoes... finally reach
          the bunkhouse.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
                         
          Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind... latches
          it. The men look worn and battered... wind-burnt faces,
          icicles in their beards.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I had enough of this cold as hell
           shit.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           What'd you figure when ya signed on
           outta that St. Louis whorehouse you
           was workin'? That you was headin'
           off to paradise?
                         
          Pig snorts a laugh at Fitzgerald's expense.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I tell ya what I figured, I figured
           I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't
           freeze before I got it outta my
           pecker.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Figured wrong.
           75.
                         
          Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare... wants to throw more, but
          Bridger's returning the stare... hard... so Fitzgerald
          decides he'd better not push it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Waste a time to check traps in this
           weather... while Henry sits warmin'
           his ass on the stove in his office.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           Why don't you go tell him that,
           Fitz? Then start your hike back to
           St. Louie.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Shit, I walked up here, I got no
           problem walkin' back.
                         
                          MURPHY
           Contracted for twelve months. We
           all did.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Henry can shove that contract up
           his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it
           for him.
                         
          The others laugh at Fitzgerald's rambling.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           You don't think I will?
                         
          The men shake their heads. Fitzgerald grabs his gloves...
          starts strapping his snowshoes back on.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Just give that fat little whore
           you're so sweet on a couple extra
           bits... she'll have you thinkin'
           it's Spring already.
                         
          The men laugh as Fitzgerald walks out... leaves the door wide
          open for the cold wind to pour over the others. Pig scurries
          over, shoving it closed.
                         
          As the other men gather around a table to play cards, Bridger
          pulls a JOURNAL from under his cot... falls onto the cot, and
          starts writing.
                         
                         
          INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - EVENING
                         
          Fitzgerald enters... looks around the empty office.
           76.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Hello? Captain?
                         
          The place is empty. Fitzgerald eyes Henry's desk... then
          past his desk... to the SAFE... its door CRACKED OPEN...
          STACKS OF MONEY visible inside.
                         
          Fitzgerald glances around... looks back to that safe.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT
                         
          Dark and quiet. The snow has stopped.
                         
                         
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Fitzgerald eases up from his cot... looks around at the
          sleeping men.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT
                         
          Fitzgerald slips out of the bunkhouse door... across the
          compound... toward the front gate.
                         
           MURPHY (O.S.)
           Where're you headed?
                         
          Fitzgerald looks up... sees Murphy in the Blockhouse on
          sentry duty.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           To the river, Murphy.
                         
          Murphy squints down into the shadows.
                         
                          MURPHY
           That you, Fitzgerald?
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Left my rifle down there... don't
           want it out all night.
                         
                          MURPHY
           That weren't too smart.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Just don't take a shot at me when I
           come back in.
                         
                          MURPHY
           We'll see.
           77.
                         
          Murphy waves Fitzgerald out.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Not that you'd hit me if you tried.
                         
          Murphy fakes a laugh... raises his rifle down at Fitzgerald.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          POV DOWN MURPHY'S RIFLE...
                         
          ...on Fitzgerald moving toward the river... disappearing into
          the darkness.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Out of sight from the fort. Fitzgerald slides the ANSTADT
          FROM UNDER HIS COAT... hurries down the bank... searches
          under the brush and snow... pulls out an OVERTURNED CANOE.
                         
          He drags it to the icy edge... slides it across the ice
          toward the middle of the river, where the water still hasn't
          frozen over. The ice CRACKS UNDER HIS FEET. Fitzgerald
          climbs in the canoe... pounds the ice with the oar, breaking
          it loose.
                         
          The current seeps through the cracks... catches the canoe,
          pulling it to the center of the wide river... sends
          Fitzgerald shooting south. He throws a glance back at the
          shadow of Fort Union in the distance... growing smaller.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
                         
          Clear blue sky. The sun glistening off the snow-covered
          ground. Glass is bundled under furs, as he rides through the
          snowy trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Tucked under the rooftop of trees. A small fire burns.
          Glass sits on his fire-bed, looking over a map.
                         
          An O.S. SNORT from the Paint Mare, tied to a tree. Glass
          looks over in time to see the horse's ears perk up.
                         
          With his eyes searching the darkness, Glass slowly reaches
          over... grabs his rifle. Then he drops to his stomach...
          slides backward into the brush.
           78.
                         
          Glass peers through the brush... the woods seem empty...
          until SEVERAL DARK SHAPES APPEAR... moving through the
          distant trees... coming straight toward Glass' camp.
                         
          Then an O.S. SNAP BEHIND GLASS... he glances back in time to
          see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A HATCHET.
                         
          Glass spins his rifle... shoves it into the stomach of the
          Warrior as he swings... BOOM... the Warrior flies back.
                         
          The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES... Arikara appear
          from all sides... charge toward the camp.
                         
          Glass scrambles up... races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS
          AND GUNSHOTS FLASH THROUGH THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM.
                         
          Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare... spots ELK'S TONGUE
          leading the charge... the necklace of ears hanging around his
          neck. And Elk's Tongue's eyes are locked on Glass... almost
          like he remembers him.
                         
          Glass takes off through the forest.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass hanging onto the paint mare, as she gallops through the
          trees... the animal's nostrils spread wide, pulling in all
          the oxygen it can.
                         
          Glass glances back... sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM... HORSES...
          ridden by Elk's Tongue and eight other warriors.
                         
          Glass digs his heels into the horse, squeezing every ounce of
          speed from her legs... pushing her toward the clearing up
          ahead... throwing another glance back... then looking in
          front of him, and realizing it isn't a clearing at all...
                         
          ...it's the edge of the world.
                         
          The paint mare explodes from the trees, then runs out of
          ground... because she's just galloped off the side of a
          cliff.
                         
          The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees, its
          legs flailing for something to stand on.
                         
          Glass drops the rifle to grip the horse's mane, hanging on
          for what seems an endless fall.
           79.
                         
          The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still
          on her back. The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she drops into the
          snow-covered trees, carrying Glass with her.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
                         
          And the horse comes crashing through the branches... the
          massive limbs slowing her fall... snapping off as her body
          hits and twists... tosses Glass away.
                         
          The Paint Mare continues her deadly descent, the trees
          tearing at her body... catching her head... SNAPPING her
          neck.
                         
          Glass slams off a branch... tumbles to the ground with a
          thud. The Paint Mare hits the snow beside him... very dead.
                         
          Glass struggles to breath... finally GASPS... sucks in the
          oxygen. He lays there a moment... stares up through the
          trees...
                         
          ...to Elk's Tongue and the others staring down from the top
          of the cliff... with no way to get to Glass.
                         
          Glass rises to his knees... glances around for his rifle...
          lost. He flinches with what must be broken ribs... drags
          himself up, and staggers to the horse... pulls his knife and
          cuts the snowshoes from the back of the saddle.
                         
          He throws the snowshoes over his shoulder... continues on,
          through the woods... alone... in the middle of nowhere...
          again.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
                         
          From high above... the small shape of Glass making his way
          over the snowy ground... heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
                         
          A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri. Two
          ramshackle structures... the General Store and a tattered
          livery stable filled with horses.
           80.
                         
                         
          INT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY
                         
          More like a saloon that sells a few supplies. A gang of
          TRAPPERS drink and play cards. A RUNTY MAN stands behind the
          counter, watching them...
                         
          ...until the door blows open, and in steps Glass. He pulls
          the fur hat away from his face, and what a sight he is...
          scarred face stiff from the cold... ice frozen in his beard.
                         
          The room falls silent... everyone staring at Glass. Until
          TRAPPER #1 snorts a laugh. Glass limps to the counter. All
          eyes follow him.
                         
                          GLASS
           (struggling to make his
           frozen lips move)
           I'm Hugh Glass of...
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           We don't serve niggers.
                         
          Glass stares at the Runty Man a beat, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company
           on my way to Fort Union.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           I don't care if you was with Lewis
           and Clark headed for the new world.
           We don't serve niggers.
                         
                          GLASS
           All I need is a horse and enough
           supplies to...
                         
                          TRAPPER
           Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause
           he ain't listenin' to you, Cees.
                         
                          GLASS
           ...to get me to Fort Union. I can
           sign a draft made good by Captain
           Henry.
                         
          The Runty Man just stares at Glass... grins a TOOTHLESS GRIN.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           What the fuck happened to your
           face, boy? You try to slice all
           the black off?
           81.
                         
                          TRAPPER #2
           Maybe we oughta help him do it
           right.
                         
                          FAT TRAPPER
           Best get on your way, boy.
                         
          Glass stares back at the men for a long beat, then...
                         
                          GLASS
           I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky
           Mountain Fur Company, and all I
           need is...
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           (to the trappers)
           Do you believe this shit?
                         
          Trapper #1 and Trapper #2 pull the SKINNING KNIVES from their
          belts... start toward Glass.
                         
                          FAT TRAPPER
           Hell, I warned ya.
                         
                          GLASS
           All I need...
                         
          And that's when Trapper #1 grabs for Glass, but in a flash of
          movement that catches them all off-guard, Glass has is own
          knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER TRAPPER #1's CHIN.
                         
          Everyone freezes.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           ...is a horse and enough supplies
           to get me to Fort Union.
                         
          Then Glass slides Trapper #1's PISTOL from his belt... aims
          it at the other men.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           And this shooter here. All made
           good by Captain Henry and The Rocky
           Mountain Fur Company.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
                         
          The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers, as
          they stand outside, rifles aimed into the distance.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Shoot him, goddammit!
           82.
                         
                          TRAPPER #2
           I can't get a clear look.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Shoot `em both!
                         
          The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles... BOOM... fires a
          wild shot past the riders.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK...
                         
          ...with Trapper #1 sitting backward on the horse behind him.
          Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs, and keeps glancing
          back to the men growing smaller behind him.
                         
          Finally, Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse.
          Trapper #1 tumbles into the snow.
                         
          The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS... too far away to reach
          Glass, who just keeps racing north.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          THE RUNTY MAN - WATCHING GLASS ESCAPE.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Get after the son of a bitch!
                         
          The trappers exchange glances... don't move.
                         
                          TRAPPER #2
           It's cold as hell, Cees.
                         
                          FAT TRAPPER
           And he did say to put it all on the
           Rocky Mountain tab.
                         
          The Runty Man glares at the trappers.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - EVENING
                         
          Glass riding the horse at a trot through the snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION - NIGHT
                         
          Thick with fog, and silent as death. The moon fights its way
          through the mist, sending an eerie glow over the fort.
           83.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT UNION/BLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair, his rifle across his lap.
          O.S. CRUNCHING... getting louder... loud enough to nudge
          Stubby Bill awake. He sits up... peers over the wall, but
          can't see anything in the fog... just hears the CRUNCHING
          MOVING CLOSER... FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          STUBBY BILL'S POV...
                         
          ...on the blanket of fog hanging in the air... that same
          CRUNCHING, as a SHADOW APPEARS... growing clearer... a FIGURE
          walking... leading a horse behind him... appearing out of the
          mist like a ghost... GLASS.
                         
          STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK...
                         
          ...sure his eyes are betraying him. But then Glass looks
          straight up at Stubby Bill, and there's no doubt.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL

          INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Dark and quiet... just Pig's snoring rattling the silence.
          Suddenly the door kicks open... SLAMS into the wall... and
          there's GLASS' SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY.
                         
          GROANS from the awakened men... hands moving through the dark
          for oil lamps... turning them bright... until the room's
          fully lit... and they all see Glass standing there... eyes
          floating across the room, searching for a target.
                         
          The men just stare back at him, like they're all part of the
          same dream.
                         
          Except for Bridger, who's propped up in his cot like he's
          been waiting all night... waiting every night... for Glass to
          appear in that doorway.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Glass raises the stolen pistol... aims it at Bridger. And
          the young man doesn't flinch... almost as if he wants to make
          sure Glass doesn't miss.
           84.
                         
          The other men just watch in silence, not sure what the hell's
          going on.
                         
          Glass holds his aim on Bridger's face... a face that's
          haunted him... kept him alive.
                         
                          GLASS
           You took everything I had... left
           me to die.
                         
          Glass walks toward Bridger, the gun still raised... each step
          of his feet on the wood floor is like the thud of an
          executioner's drum.
                         
          MUMBLING from the other men, as they watch this ghost reach
          Bridger... stand over him, the pistol aimed down.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Why?
                         
                          BRIDGER
           I was scared of dyin'.
                          (BEAT)
           But every day since, I've wished I
           had.
                         
          Glass' finger tightens on the trigger, ready to make
          Bridger's wish come true.
                         
          The rest of the bunkhouse watches this execution in wide-
          eyed, stone silence, afraid to move.
                         
                          GLASS
           There wasn't no `Ree that night,
           was there?
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          BRIDGER
           No.
                         
          Glass PISTOL WHIPS BRIDGER, knocking him to the floor. And
          before Bridger can crawl away, Glass in over him... those
          aching, frozen fists beating mercilessly down on Bridger.
                         
          And Bridger doesn't fight back... just does his best to cover
          up, but the blows keep coming, and Bridger's face is covered
          in blood...
                         
          ...just as Henry runs inside, half-dressed from where Stubby
          Bill awoke him. Henry grabs Glass... pulls him off.
                         
          Glass spins... jams his pistol right in Henry's face.
           85.
                         
                          HENRY
           Hugh. Wait.
                         
          Glass is crazy with rage... barely stops himself from pulling
          that trigger. But finally, he calms... his arm sinks,
          lowering his aim. He glances around the bunkhouse.
                         
                          GLASS
           Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle?
                         
                          HENRY
           Deserted two days ago. Along with
           about five hundred dollars of
           company money.
                          (BEAT)
           Let's get some coffee to warm you
           up.
           (to Glass, but looking at
                          BRIDGER)
           I wanna hear what happened.
                         
          Glass looks back to Bridger... they hold a long stare, until
          Glass walks out.
                         
                          BRIDGER
           Wait. Please!
                         
          But Glass and Henry disappear, leaving Bridger alone with all
          those eyes burning into him. Bridger looks to Pig, but Pig
          just lowers his eyes... can't even look at the boy.
                         
          The men step into their boots and furs... file out after
          Glass and Henry... leaving Bridger alone in the bunkhouse.
                         
                         
          INT. ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          Glass sits by the warmth of the stove, sipping coffee.
          Henry's behind he desk, with the other men scattered around.
                         
                          GLASS
           I cut the shoes loose of her, and
           hiked over to Fort Talbot.

           there about a stoled horse and
           supplies charged to you.

                          HENRY
           We'll take care of it. You should
           go settle in.
                         
                          MURPHY
           There's a couple fair whores next
           door that'll ease the miles on ya,
           scars or not.
                         
          Stubby Bill gives Murphy an elbow.
                         
                          ANDERSON

                          MURPHY
           I just meant I'd go roust one of
           `em for ya if you wanted.
                         
                          GLASS
           She can take the night off, but I
           wouldn't mind the use of her bed.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (TO MURPHY)
           Go clear out a room. The rest head
           on back to bunk.
                         
          Murphy hustles out. The others move toward the door, each
          stopping to shake Glass' hand, or give him a pat on the back.
                         
                          PIG
           I told ya I'd see ya up here. You
           remember that, Hugh?
                         
                          GLASS
           I do, Pig. You must have a little
           gypsy in ya.
                         
          Pig grins and nods.
                         
                          PIG
           I'll see ya in the mornin'.
                         
          Pig exits, leaving just Glass and Henry, sitting in a beat of
          silence, until...
                         
                          HENRY
           Can I talk you outta what you're
           planning?
                         
          Glass doesn't answer... just stands, placing the coffee cup
          on the table.
           87.
                         
                          GLASS
           Thank you for what you done for
           me... stitchin' me back together...
           givin' me a chance.
                         
                          HENRY
           I'm offerin' you another right
           now... to stay here... let this
           thing go.
                         
                          GLASS
                          (BEAT)
           He thinks he let me die. But he
           don't know that he's the one that's
           kept me alive... for the chance of
           findin' him... makin' him pay for
           what he done.
                         
                          HENRY
           The law will make Fitzgerald pay.
                         
          Glass stares out the window... his SCARRED REFLECTION stares
          back at him.
                         
                          GLASS
           You told me once that other men
           didn't think like him.
                          (BEAT)
           But the truth is, most do. I seen
           it my whole life... the looks folks
           give... the whisperin'. I watched
           my wife and son die from the fever
           on accounta no white doctor would
           care for `em. Wasn't no different
           to them than if their neighbor's
           dog was sick.
                          (BEAT)
           So I don't figure nobody's gonna
           care much that Fitzgerald took some
           dyin' nigger's rifle, and left him
           in the middle of nowhere.
           (turns to Henry)
           Do you, Captain?
                         
          Henry doesn't answer... because he knows Glass is right.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           I thank you for the coffee.
                         
          Glass walks out. Henry just sits there.
           88.

          Glass, Pig and Murphy stand by Glass' horse, as he ties off
          his supplies.
                         
                          MURPHY
           He said he was goin' to get his
           rifle...
                         
          And then Murphy catches himself... shrugs.
                         
                          MURPHY (CONT'D)
           Your rifle. But he never showed
           back up. The next day I figured
           him mighta fell in, but then Pig
           seen the canoe was missin'.
                         
                          PIG
           And the Captain found the money
           gone.
                         
                          GLASS
           I'll make my way down river. See
           what turns up.
                         
          Glass pulls the cinch tight around the horse. Stubby Bill
          comes waddling toward them.
                         
                          STUBBY BILL
           The kid's gone... gear and all.
           Musta slipped out before light.
                         
          Stubby Bill waves Bridger's journal at them.
                         
           STUBBY BILL (cont'd)
           Just left this on his bunk.
                         
          Henry takes the journal... flips it open.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (READING)
           "Every day I think about what I
           done. I want to tell Pig and the
           others the truth but am afraid what
           they'll think of me. I look at
           Fitzgerald and want to kill him but
           am afraid to try. I am a coward
           and wish he hadn't been lyin about
           the Ree that night. I wish they
           had come and kilt us both."
                         
          Glass considers the words a beat, then swings onto his horse.
           89.
                         
                          GLASS
           If I run across the boy, I'll send
           him back your way.
                         
          Glass sees Henry on horseback, trotting toward them.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Where're you headed?
                         
                          HENRY
           Fitzgerald stole five hundred
           dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur
           Company wants him too.
                         
                          GLASS
           I can do this on my own.
                         
                          HENRY
           I know you can. But maybe you
           won't have to.
                         
          Glass stares at Henry a beat, then finally just pulls his
          horse around... heads for the river. Henry nods to Pig and
          Murphy as he follows after Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROCK LEDGE - DAY
                         
          From above Fort Union. Our POV on Glass and Henry riding
          south along the icy river.
                         
          And then we see our POV is Bridger's... standing along the
          ledge, loaded with all his gear. He watches the riders
          another moment, then turns... hikes the opposite direction...
          leaving Fort Union behind forever.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT/GENERAL STORE - DAY
                         
          The Runty Man behind the counter. A few of the same Trappers
          drinking... playing cards. Just another day at Fort Talbot.
                         
          The door swings open, and a FUR-COVERED FIGURE enters.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           We ain't got no food to spare,
           friend, if that's what you're
           lookin' for.
                         
          The figure pulls back his furs, and we see it's Fitzgerald...
          cold and miserable.
           90.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Then what the hell have ya got?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Whiskey and blankets mostly.
           Weather's held back deliveries.
                         
          Fitzgerald throws a glance to the Trappers.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Gimme a couple bottles then.
           Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been
           walkin' for two days.
                         
          The Runty Man hands Fitzgerald the bottles. Fitzgerald pops
          one... gulps some down.
                         
                          FITZGERALD (CONT'D)
           How much for one of them horses out
           there?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Horses ain't cheap this time a
           year.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain
           Fur Company's good for it.
                         
          And those words stop everything. The Trappers all turn from
          their game. The Runty Man glares at Fitzgerald.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           You're the second son of a bitch
           come in here makin' that claim.
           And the first one left a bad taste.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           That right? Well I don't know
           nothin' about that. Just that I
           need a horse.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           So did this other fella. So he
           stole one... along with Lange's
           pistola.
                         
          Trapper #1 nods to Fitzgerald.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Fine then, I'll pay cash for the
           horse. How much?
           91.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           How `bout you pay for your friend's
           too.
                         
                          TRAPPER #1
           And my shooter.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Wasn't my friend.
                         
          Trapper #1 stands up.
                         
                          TRAPPER #1
           Then from where I stand, you don't
           got no friends at all.
                         
          The other Trappers glare at Fitzgerald. The Runty Man just
          grins that toothless smile of his. Fitzgerald's in a bind,
          and he knows it.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Yeah, okay. I'll collect from him.
           How much?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           How `bout we say eighty...
           (sees Fitzgerald doesn't
                          ARGUE)
           ...five.
                         
          Fitzgerald starts digging into his pocket.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           You boys are leavin' me with
           nothin'. Better be a helluva
           horse.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           Pick of the litter.
                         
          The Runty Man snatches the cash.
                         
           RUNTY MAN (cont'd)
           And when you see that scarred-up
           nigger, you tell him he'd best not
           show up here again.
                         
          Fitzgerald freezes... not sure he heard correctly.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           When I see who?
           92.
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           The black son of a bitch that
           robbed me. You tell him that.
                         
          A long beat, then...
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Scarred up, you say... and headed
           up to Union?
                         
                          RUNTY MAN
           That's what he told us. Seemed
           real anxious to get there too.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
                          (NODS)
           I'll make sure to give him the
           message when I find him.
                         
                         
          EXT. FORT TALBOT - DAY
                         
          Fitzgerald sits on the horse, staring back over the ground...
          his LINE OF TRACKS LEADING THROUGH THE SNOW. He turns...
          looks south, then back to the tracks.
                         
          Finally, Fitzgerald digs his heels into the horse. The
          animal takes off, right along Fitzgerald's tracks in the
          snow... right back toward Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY
                         
          Thick ice along the edges, tapering to a narrow stream of
          flowing water at the very center.
                         
          Glass and Henry ride along the snow-covered bank.
                         
                          HENRY
           Hugh.
                         
          Henry points. Glass follows his finger along the river... to
          a CANOE resting on the bank ahead. They dismount... examine
          the canoe... the letters "RMFC" painted on the side.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           That's it.
                         
          Glass runs his mittened hand along the gashes in the wood.
                         
                          GLASS
           Ice tore it up.
           93.
                         
          Glass looks to the FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW, leading deep into
          the trees. He glances up to the sky... clear and blue.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           If the snow holds off, we'll have a
           good trail to track.
                         
                          HENRY
           What's out that direction? Talbot?
                         
                          GLASS
           And the Missouri. Doubt he'd risk
           the river with the `Ree. Likely
           grab a horse, and cross over
           high... take his chances goin' east
           against the weather. When'd you
           say he skipped out?
                         
                          HENRY
           Three days ago now.
                         
                          GLASS
           We best pick up our pace.
                         
          They climb back onto their horses... trot into the trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
                         
          Glass and Henry gallop across, their path dead on
          Fitzgerald's tracks.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
                         
          The snow is shallow here, the ground protected by the trees.
          There's a black spot where a fire once burned, and footprints
          all over the place. Glass is off his horse, crouched,
          studying the site... lifting the charred chunks of wood.
                         
                          HENRY
           This was Fitzgerald camped here?
                         
                          GLASS
           Couple nights back. But these
           tracks aren't all his.
                         
                          HENRY
           He's travelin' with somebody?
           94.
                         
                          GLASS
           (shakes his head)
           Came in after. Prints are smooth.
           Mocassins.
                         
          Henry throws Glass a look... he knows what that means.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           Could be Sioux... Blackfoot even.
                         
                          HENRY
           But you figure they're `Ree.
                         
                          GLASS
           I don't figure nothin', Captain.
           But whoever it is, they're a good
           day behind Fitzgerald.
                         
          Glass walks, leading his horse, as he follows the tracks away
          from camp. Henry rides after him.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           And they're on his trail too, so we
           should keep it quiet... don't
           announce we're back here.
                         
                          HENRY
           You told me once you knew enough to
           keep away from the `Ree.
                         
                          GLASS
           I do.
                         
                          HENRY
           You figure this is smart then?
                         
          Glass swings up onto his horse.
                         
                          GLASS
           You're welcome to head back,
           Captain.
                         
          Glass trots off. Henry watches him a beat, then throws a
          glance into the trees... follows after Glass.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Glass kneels on the ground, building a fire-bed... dragging
          the dirt over the fire and rocks. Henry's under a blanket,
          watching him.
           95.
                         
                          HENRY
           What if we find Fitzgerald... and I
           ask you not to do this?
                         
          Glass spreads a blanket over the ground.
                         
                          GLASS
           Don't ask me.
                         
          Glass settles in on the warm earth. Henry just keeps
          watching him.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - LATER
                         
          ANGLE ON HENRY...
                         
          ...asleep under the blanket. O.S. RUSTLING sends his eyes
          flashing open. He raises up... rifle ready.
                         
          He glances at Glass, who puts a finger over his lips.
                         
                          HENRY
                          (WHISPERS)
           `Ree?
                         
          Glass doesn't answer... just keeps searching the brush.
                         
          Henry's groggy eyes dart around the night... spots MOVEMENT
          IN THE BRUSH.
                         
                          HENRY (CONT'D)
           There!
                         
                          GLASS
           Wait!
                         
          But it's too late... Henry fires... BOOM... the shot explodes
          through the night...
                         
          ...and the DEER leaps away.
                         
          Henry looks to Glass... shakes his head... sorry.
                         
                          HENRY
           So much for stayin' quiet.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           96.
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD - SQUATTING BESIDE A SMALL FIRE...
                         
          ...staring out into the darkness, as the GUNSHOT ECHOES OVER
          HIM. Fitzgerald immediately throws dirt over the flames.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CAMP - NIGHT
                         
          Glass and Henry are loaded up, back on their horses.
                         
                          HENRY
           Guess you would've been better off
           on your own.
                         
                          GLASS
           We needed to pick up some time
           anyways.
                         
          The two riders disappear into the dark trees.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT
                         
          Glass and Henry riding across a meadow. Glass stops... tilts
          his head back to sniff the air.
                         
                          HENRY
           Whatta ya got?
                         
                          GLASS
           Smoke.
                         
          Glass pulls some snow from his horse's mane... tosses it in
          the air, and watches it blow to the side.
                         
          Glass turns his horse toward the breeze... squints out into
          the night.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           No more than mile out that way.
           (pulls his rifle)
           I'll head in from the west... you
           take the east.
                         
                          HENRY
           What if it's `Ree?
                         
                          GLASS
           Then we leave `em be... meet back
           up here.
           97.
                         
          Henry nods... Glass takes off at a trot. Henry veers the
          other direction... splitting up across the snow.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines. Glass on
          horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and
          disappearing.
                         
          He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows.
          Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Henry's already off his horse... leading it through the
          trees... searching as he walks.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass moves silently through the darkness... rifle poised to
          aim and fire... just like the first time we saw him,
          perfectly comfortable in this world.
                         
          His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth...
          picking up everything.
                         
          He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire. The
          slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air. Glass
          crouches down, studying the surround ground... HOOF-PRINTS
          blended in with the other tracks.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Henry's horse is making too much noise with each step. He
          stops walking... wraps the reins around a tree... walks back
          around the horse...
                         
          ...AND THERE'S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM...
                         
          ...Glass' Anstadt aimed and ready to fire.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           Didn't figure an important man like
           you to be away from your stove on a
           night as cold as this, Captain.
           You lost?
                         
          Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle. His
          eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle.
           98.
                         
                          HENRY
           I'm here to save your life.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           I done told you boys... I don't
           need savin' by you or nobody else.
                         
          Henry knows he's only got one chance... he makes a grab for
          the rifle.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass running his fingers across the tracks. Suddenly an
          O.S. GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE. Glass spins to it...
          races back through the trees toward his horse.
                         
                         
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
                         
          Glass at full gallop through the woods... veering between
          trees... ducking branches.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry's horse standing
          in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off
          the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground
          with his rifle ready...
                         
          ...and sees HENRY'S BODY face-up in the snow.
                         
          Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides
          over to Henry...
                         
          ...and we see he's a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his
          chest leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT
          EAR SLICED OFF.
                         
          Glass stands back up, turning in a circle, as he peers into
          the distance around him. But there's nothing out there.
          Glass SCREAMS in rage.
                         
          He turns back to Henry... crouches down over him.
                         
                          GLASS
           You shouldn't a come.
                         
          As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry
          by the chin, and tilts his head. And HENRY'S RIGHT EAR HAS
          BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL.
           99.
                         
          Glass stares at Henry a beat, then squints out into the
          forest.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           (repeating Spotted Horse's
           words under his breath)
           Arikara take right ear of Sioux.
           Left ear of whites. Not know what
           they take from you.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT
                         
          Glass on horseback, leading Henry's horse behind him across
          the snow-covered meadow. Henry's fur-covered body is draped
          over the saddle.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a
          bit at the center. Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at
          the thick ice to get to the water beneath. He makes a
          hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into
          the darkness.
                         
          Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest
          beyond... like he knows what's waiting for him there.
                         
          He walks to the horses, tied in the trees at the base of the
          slope... Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in
          his bloody furs.
                         
          Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that
          slope.
                         
                         
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
                         
          OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST...
                         
          ...watching from the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over
          the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry
          draped over the horse behind.
                         
          The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and
          branches under the horses' hooves.
                         
          Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN'T SEEN BESIDE US
          FLASHES IN THE NIGHT...
                         
          ...and Glass tumbles off his horse.
           100.
                         
          The horses prance around with a start, then settle... and
          then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases
          toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves.
                         
          He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering
          him.
                         
          And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to
          suddenly roll over firing...
                         
          ...but Glass doesn't move. Fitzgerald nudges him with his
          boot, then crouches down... grabs Glass by the shoulder, and
          pulls him over...
                         
          ...and there's HENRY'S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE
          FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back.
                         
                         
          ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY'S HORSE...
                         
          ...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS' SADDLE to hold
          Henry upright...
                         
          ...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second
          horse... MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a
          rifle... the head raising up... it's GLASS... taking aim...
                         
          ...as Fitzgerald realizes what's happened... spins with the
          Anstadt...
                         
          ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on
          Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode...
                         
          ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush.
                         
          Fitzgerald's wild shot hits Henry's horse, sending it rearing
          up, tossing Glass to the ground.
                         
          But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he
          charges into the brush...
                         
          ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE.
                         
          Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as
          the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air... WHACK...
          clubs him across the head, sending him tumbling down the
          slope to the frozen river.
                         
          Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER,
          snatches up his knife, and charges down the slope to finish
          Glass off.
           101.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Glass lies on the ice, barely conscious. Blood oozes down
          his head... over his eyes. He wipes it away to see
          Fitzgerald barreling down toward him.
                         
          Fitzgerald dives in attack, but Glass kicks up his leg,
          sending Fitzgerald flying over... SLAMMING into the frozen
          river, his head CRACKING THE ICE.
                         
          Glass rips the knife from his belt... moves after Fitzgerald,
          his feet slipping and sliding under him.
                         
          Fitzgerald rises to his feet... the men charge like two wild
          animals... crash into each other... knives flailing.
                         
          They roll along the ice, blades glistening... slicing through
          furs... across flesh.
                         
          Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down... plants it through the
          back of Glass' hand, pinning it to the ice. Glass CRIES
          OUT... drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald's out. As he
          does, Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face, sending him sailing
          back... sliding to the center of the river.
                         
          The thin ice around him splinters... cracks. Glass looks
          up... sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him, HOLDING BOTH
          KNIVES now. Glass is trapped...
                         
          ...until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice... it
          begins to give... he pounds it again and again... Fitzgerald
          speeds up to get to Glass in time... raises one of the
          knives, as Glass shatters the ice... drops beneath the
          surface.
                         
          Fitzgerald rushes after him, but the ice cracks under his
          feet, forcing him back.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          UNDERWATER...
                         
          ...and Glass just under the ice, floating with the current.
          His fingers search for a hole, but there's nothing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           102.
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...making his way down the river, peering through the ice,
          searching for Glass. He spots something... stops... leans
          close to make out the shape... it's GLASS' FEET.
                         
          Then suddenly, GLASS' FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT
          FITZGERALD'S FEET... grab Fitzgerald's leg, pulling him down.
                         
          Fitzgerald crashes to the ice... it splinters around him...
          gives away, and he sinks into the icy water... but the
          ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE... holds him
          against the current.
                         
          Glass drags himself from the water... stands... stares down
          at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole... his face looking up at
          Glass through the ice. Glass lifts one of the fallen
          knives... stands over Fitzgerald.
                         
                          FITZGERALD
           (through the water and
                          ICE)
           Help me!
           (off Glass' stare)
           Glass... please!
                         
          Glass hesitates a beat, staring at him, just as he did with
          Bridger that night in the bunkhouse. And then Glass leans
          down... grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up.
                         
          Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE
          ANSTADT, sending Fitzgerald floating away under the ice, as
          Glass holds on to the Anstadt.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          FITZGERALD...
                         
          ...floating under the surface... pounding at the ice as he
          drifts, until his swinging slows... stops... his body drifts
          away.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT
                         
          Glass stands on the ice, blood dripping down his face,
          holding his Anstadt. He begins to tremble... not from the
          cold, but from finally reaching the end of this journey. His
          eyes begin to fill with tears...
           103.
                         
          ...and then he sees ELK'S TONGUE, and SEVERAL OTHER ARIKARA
          WARRIORS watching him from the other side of the river.
                         
          Glass and Elk's Tongue exchange a long stare, until finally
          Glass SCREAMS OUT.
                         
                          GLASS
           I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed
           whites and I have killed Arikara
           and I have killed grizzly! AND I
           WILL KILL YOU!
                         
          Elk's Tongue doesn't move... just stares back at Glass...
          soaked in blood and water. Then Glass CRIES OUT at the
          warriors again.
                         
                          GLASS (CONT'D)
           COME ON!
                         
          But the Arikara don't attack... don't move at all... until
          Elk's Tongue gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS, then turns...
          they disappear back into the trees.
                         
          Glass watches them fade away, then collapses to his knees on
          the icy river... exhausted in every possible way.
                         
          He begins to cry.
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
                         
                          THE END

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK.
          
          City lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New
          York City. The SOUNDS of a cocktail party.
          
          
          INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK.
          
          A party   of bohemian types in the village. Artist's canvases
          propped   up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples
          talking   intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people
          smoking   and drinking.
          
          A man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner...
          
          FRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a
          patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making
          her laugh.
          
                                FRANK
                      So, what do you do?
          
                                APRIL
                      I'm studying to be an actress.
                      You?
          
                                FRANK
                      I'm a longshoreman.
          
                                APRIL
                          (smiles)
                      No, I mean really.
          
                                FRANK
                      I mean really too. Starting
                      Monday, though, I'm doing something
                      a little more glamorous. Night
                      cashier at a cafeteria.
          
                                APRIL
                          (smiles)
                      I don't mean how you make money.   I
                      mean what are you interested in?
          
                                FRANK
                      Honey - if I had the answer to that
                      one, I bet I'd bore us both to
                      death in half an hour.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          She laughs.   He smiles, revelling in her attention.
          
          
          INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947, LATER.
          
          Later, Frank and April dance. They move well, in sync,
          looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the
          silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her
          back.
          
          Close on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they
          lose themselves in each other...
          
                                                         SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT.
          
          Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and
          tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we
          hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play...
          
          Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls.   Nothing.   Then
          vigorous, relieved applause.
          
          Frank hears a voice from behind, through the applause:
          
                              WOMAN
                    Thank God that's over...
          
          April takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank
          applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining
          him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause.
          
          Then Frank hears the voice again:
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    ...And she was very disappointing.
          
          He can't argue.
          
          
          INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members
          towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye-
          contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          MR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in his
          way.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Frank! Very nice Frank!
          
                              FRANK
                    Thanks, Mrs. Givings.
          
          Frank steps around her.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I can't tell you how much we
                    enjoyed it. You have a very
                    talented wife.
          
          Frank forces a smile as he goes.
          
                              FRANK
                    I'll pass it along!
          
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          April sits alone at her dressing table crying.
          
          
          INT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT.
          
          The CAST mills backstage. The mood is subdued, but some have
          decided to make light of the disaster.
          
          Frank moves through the crowd.    Across the room, he sees -
          
          MILLY CAMPBELL, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip-
          toes. Her husband SHEP, 30's, heavy-set, is still in
          costume, shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat.
          
                              MILLY
                    Frank!
          
                              FRANK
                    Hi!
          
                              MILLY
                    She's through there...!
                        (points)
                    You `bout ready for that drink?
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Couple of minutes!
          
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank enters. The chair in front of the mirror is empty. A
          cigarette burns in the ashtray. Frank glances at a standing
          screen in the corner. April's costume is draped over the
          top. He goes towards it, deciding what to say.
          
                               FRANK
                        (heartfelt)
                    April, sweetheart.   You were great.
                    I mean it.
          
          The door to the bathroom opens. April enters in street
          clothes. Frank's been talking to an empty room.
          
                              APRIL
                    Hi. You about ready to leave?
                    I've just got to get this makeup
                    off, then we can go.
          
          She sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at
          him. FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying. He
          puts his hand on her shoulder.
          
                              FRANK
                    Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph
                    or anything, was it?
          
          APRIL looks at him in the mirror. She holds his look just a
          second. And from her expression, he knows he said exactly
          the wrong thing.
          
                              APRIL
                    I guess not. I'll be ready in a
                    minute.
          
                              FRANK
                    Take your time.
          
          He removes his hands and lights a cigarette.     APRIL begins to
          take off her makeup.
          
                                                                        5.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Will you do me a favor? Milly and
                    Shep wanted us to go out with them
                    afterwards. Will you say we can't?
                    Say it's because of the baby sitter
                    or something?
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, the thing is, I already said
                    that we could. I mean, I just saw
                    them out there and I said we would.
          
                              APRIL
                        (tense)
                    Oh. Then would you mind going out
                    again and saying you were mistaken?
                    That should be simple enough.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't you think that's a little bit
                    rude, April?
          
                              APRIL
                    Well I'll tell them myself.
          
                               FRANK
                    Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll
                    tell them.
          
          He backs to the door.
          
          
          INT. HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
          
          April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past
          school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.
          
          They don't touch.   They don't speak.   The tension between
          them is palpable.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
          
          Frank drives. April stares ahead.    Their faces are lit by
          the dashboard. After a while...
          
                                                               6.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    I mean it, baby. You were the only
                    person in that play.
          
                                 APRIL
                    Thank you.
          
          He looks over at her.
          
                              FRANK
                    We just never should've let you get
                    mixed up in the damned thing.
          
                                 APRIL
                    All right.
          
                              FRANK
                    You've studied for Christ's sake.
          
                              APRIL
                    Could we sort of stop talking about
                    it now?
          
                              FRANK
                    Sure. I just don't want you
                    feeling bad about it, that's all.
                    Because it's not worth it. I mean,
                    it's bad enough having to live out
                    here among these damn people -
                    what'd you say?
          
                              APRIL
                    I said yes. All right, Frank.
                    Could you just stop talking now,
                    before you drive me crazy, please?
          
          Frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing? Why are we
                    stopping?
          
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT.
          
          The car comes to a stop at the side of the road.
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
          
          Frank turns off the ignition.   He slides towards her.
          
                              APRIL
                    No, Frank, please don't...
          
          He puts his arms around her.
          
                              FRANK
                    Baby, it's okay...
          
                              APRIL
                    Please don't touch me.
          
                               FRANK
                    April...
          
                              APRIL
                    Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME
                    ALONE!
          
          Frank slides back behind the wheel.    Beat.
          
                              FRANK
                    It strikes me, that there's a
                    considerable amount of bullshit
                    going on here.... And there's one
                    or two things I'd like to clear up.
                    Number one, it's not my fault the
                    play was lousy. Number two, it's
                    sure as hell not my fault you
                    didn't turn out to be an actress,
                    and the sooner you get over that
                    little piece of soap opera the
                    better off we'll both be. Number
                    three, I don't happen to fit the
                    role of dumb, insensitive suburban
                    husband; you've been trying to hang
                    that one on me ever since we moved
                    here. Number four -
          
          She opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the
          headlights. Frank struggles with his door.
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT.
          
          April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over
          an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the
          distance. This is still farmland.
          
          Frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.
          
                              FRANK
                    What the hell are you doing?     Come
                    back to the car.
          
                             APRIL
                    No. Just let me stand here a
                    second.
          
          Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches.    He
          puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The
          car's headlights light up April's back, then pass.
          
                              FRANK
                    April?
          
          She doesn't move.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Look, can't we sit in the car and
                    talk about it, instead of running
                    all over Route Twelve?
          
                              APRIL
                    Haven't I made it clear I don't
                    particularly want to talk about it?
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice
                    about this thing.
          
                              APRIL
                    How kind of you. How terribly,
                    terribly kind of you.
          
                              FRANK
                    Wait a minute. I don't deserve
                    this.
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    You're always so wonderfully
                    definite, aren't you, on the
                    subject of what you do and don't
                    deserve?
          
          She turns and walks past him back towards the car.
          
                              FRANK
                    Wait a minute!
          
          He stumbles after her.   Other cars whizz by, but he's past
          caring.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Wait a minute, God damn it!
          
          She leans against the car and folds her arms.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You listen to me. This is one time
                    you're not going to get away with
                    twisting everything I say.
          
                              APRIL
                    Christ, I wish you'd stayed home
                    tonight!
          
                              FRANK
                    You know what you are when you're
                    like this? You're sick. I really
                    mean that. You're sick!
          
                              APRIL
                    And you know what you are?
                        (eyes raking him)
                    You're disgusting.
          
                                FRANK
                    Oh, yeah?
          
                              APRIL
                    Just because you've got me safely
                    in this little trap, you think you
                    can bully me into feeling whatever
                    you want!
          
                                                                    10.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You in a trap! You in a trap!
                    Jesus, don't make me laugh!
          
                              APRIL
                    Yes, me.
                        (clutching at her chest)
                    Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic
                    little boy ­­ Look at you! Look at
                    you, and tell me how by any stretch
                    of the imagination you can call
                    yourself a man!
          
          He raises his fist, she flinches away, and BONG! BONG! BONG!
          BONG! He punches the hood of the car. Then, silence. The
          look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever
          received: a look of pitying boredom.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't look at me like that, April.
          
                              APRIL
                    Could we please go home now?
          
          She calmly walks around and gets in the car.    After a moment,
          Frank follows...
          
          
          INT. CAR - NIGHT.
          
          They sit silently in the car in the darkness.
          
          TITLE CARD: REVOLUTIONARY ROAD
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - MORNING.
          
          A small, attractive suburban house in the morning sunshine.
          Frank walks out to the car, stops and looks back at the
          house.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
          
          April stands at the window.   The SOUND of the car pulling
          away.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - MORNING.
          
          Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of
          commuters. The morning commuter train eases into the
          station.
          
          
          INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MORNING.
          
          Frank sits against the train window holding a "New Yorker."
          Around him, the train is crowded with men reading newspapers.
          
          
          INT. GRAND CENTRAL PLATFORM - MORNING.
          
          In one swift movement, all the doors of the commuter train
          swing open as a hundred feet step down onto the platform.
          
          
          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING.
          
          An empty stairwell in Grand Central: a tide of grim,
          determined commuters rise into view. A mass of suits and
          hats. Frank is amongst them.
          
          
          EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - MORNING.
          
          Knox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure.   Thick
          HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks.
          
          Frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright
          cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their
          pencils at a list of product benefits - "SPEED, ACCURACY,
          CONTROL."
          
          Pride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500
          Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: "Performs A Man's
          Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!"
          
          
          INT. KNOX BUILDING ELEVATOR - MORNING.
          
          Frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator.
          He glances over at -
          
          MAUREEN GRUBE, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably
          sexy.   She meets his look. And looks away.
          
                                                                    12.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING.
          
          Frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his
          feet and lights a cigarette.
          
                              JACK (O.S.)
                    I'm going to need your help this
                    morning, Old Scout.
          
          Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with
          greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a
          file. He is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand
          while shielding his eyes.
          
                              JACK (CONT'D)
                    For the next few hours, you're to
                    warn me of Bandy's every approach
                    and you may have to screen me from
                    public view in the likely event I
                    that I throw up. It's that bad.
          
                              FRANK
                    Good morning, Jack.
          
                              JACK
                    Nothing good about it, I assure
                    you.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY.
          
          April drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. She
          stops and looks down the empty road. Not a single human
          being in sight.
          
          Close on April's face.
          
          
          INT. MRS. GIVINGS' CAR - DAY, 1948. FLASHBACK.
          
          Mrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a
          suburban street talking at high speed.
          
          Frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses.    April sits in the
          back.
          
          We don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as it
          plays on their faces.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
                               MRS. GIVINGS
                    Of course, I knew the moment you
                    came off the train what you were
                    looking for... A small remodeled
                    barn, or a carriage house ­ And I
                    just hate to be the one to tell you
                    that sort of thing just isn't
                    available anymore... But I don't
                    want you to despair. There is one
                    place down here I want to show
                    you... Now of course it isn't very
                    desirable at this end.
                        (gestures)
                    As you see, Crawford Road is mostly
                    these little cinder-blocky, pick-up
                    trucky places ­ plumbers,
                    carpenters, little local people of
                    that sort.
          
          Frank turns around to April, lowers his glasses. April
          stifles a giggle.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    But eventually...
                        (she points, her arm fully
                         extended)
                    Eventually it leads up to
                    Revolutionary Road, which is much
                    nicer. Now, the place I want to
                    show you, is a sweet little house
                    and a sweet little setting.
                    Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
                    marvelous for children. It's right
                    around this next curve... Now,
                    you'll see it ­ there.
          
          They all look.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    See the little white one? Sweet
                    isn't it? The perky way it sits
                    there on its little slope?
                    Charming, isn't it?
          
          April smiles.    A smile full of promise.
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
                               APRIL
                    Oh, yes.
          
          
          INT. BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. PRESENT.
          
          Frank's FIST raps against the door of an office...
          
          TED BANDY, 46, tight and precise, looks up from behind a well-
          organized desk.
          
                              FRANK
                    You wanted to see me?
          
          Bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk.
          
                              BANDY
                    Came for you from Toledo this
                    morning.
          
          Frank reaches for it, but Bandy moves it out of reach.
          
                              BANDY (CONT'D)
                    This is the third one this month.
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh, right, sorry. I thought I'd
                    taken care of that...
          
          Frank reaches again, but Bandy moves it.   A little man
          enjoying his power.
          
                              BANDY
                    I'm not prepared to have this
                    conversation again, Frank. You
                    understand?
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Absolutely, yes.
          
                              BANDY
                    These folks in the provinces look
                    up to us, Frank.    We need to be
                    efficient. We can't have this kind
                    of back and forth, and so forth.
                    It's just not efficient. Am I
                    right?
          
                                                                    15.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Absolutely, yes, yes...
          
          Bandy finally hands over the envelope.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - DAY.
          
          Frank sits at his desk.
          
                              JACK
                    What was that about?
          
                              FRANK
                    Toledo. Branch manager wants a
                    revised brochure for the conference
                    on "The Knox 500."
                        (impersonating Bandy)
                    "It's just not efficient."
          
                              JACK
                        (sharp inhale)
                    Sounds like a real goodie.
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't even know what the Knox 500
                    does... Do you?
          
                              JACK
                    Don't insult me.
          
          Frank drops it in his In Box. Then, looking up, he sees
          Maureen across the office. Thinks.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, MAUREEN'S DESK - DAY.
          
          Frank stands over Maureen at her desk.   The envelope from
          Toledo lies in front of her.
          
                              FRANK
                    Now, if you'll look in the inactive
                    file under SP-1109 you'll find
                    copies of all the stuff we sent to
                    the agency... and that way we can
                    trace the thing back to its
                    original sources.
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          She nods, jotting down a note.
          
          For the first time, Frank allows himself to take in her
          profile, her cleavage, her lips.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I hope you weren't planning on an
                    early lunch.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I'm not really hungry.
          
                              FRANK
                    Good. I'll check on you later.
          
          
          INT. ALGONQUIN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON.
          
          Maureen and Frank sit in a secluded corner.    Maureen sips a
          martini. She's already a little drunk.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You know something? You're lucky
                    you met me.
          
                                MAUREEN
                    Oh?    How's that?
          
                              FRANK
                    I can show you the ropes. There's
                    an art to survival at Knox. Let me
                    show you what I mean.
          
          He waves over the waiter.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Bring me the telephone would you?
                    And two more martinis.
          
          Maureen looks daunted at her empty glass.
          
                                MAUREEN
                    Wow.
          
          The waiter brings over the phone. Frank dials. He holds his
          finger to his lips. He uses an authoritative tone.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank
                    Wheeler here. Just wanted to let
                    you know that I've had to send
                    Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides
                    for me. I'll probably need her the
                    rest of the day... Okay? Fine.
                    You too.
          
          Frank hangs up and smiles at Maureen.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I never even heard of Visual Aides.
          
                              FRANK
                    That's because it doesn't exist.
          
          Maureen smiles.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
          
          Now we're moving behind April as she moves through the silent
          house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip.
          She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of
          children playing.
          
                                MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)
                    Yoo-hoo!
          
          She turns to see Mrs. Givings at the screen door.
          
          April manages a friendly smile.
          
                                APRIL
                    Hi Helen.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I can't stay a minute... My, don't
                    you look comfy! I just wanted to
                    bring this sedum for that messy
                    patch in the front yard.
          
          She puts it on the table.
          
                                                                 18.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    All it wants is just a tiny dollop
                    of water for the first few days,
                    and you'll find it absolutely
                    thrives.
          
                              APRIL
                    Well, thank you... You want some
                    coffee?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Only if you're having some.
          
          Helen sits down. With the end of her finger, she pushes a
          dirty dish out of her way.
          
                              APRIL
                    Is there something I can do for
                    you, Helen?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do
                    have a small favor I'd like to
                    ask...
                        (quiver of anxiety )
                    It's about my son, John. He's been
                    in the hospital.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm sorry to hear that.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Well, actually, just for the
                    present, he's in Pleasant Brook...
                    Psychiatric.
          
          April's face.   She knows what it means.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...I'm so sorry.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh... Nothing serious. He just
                    got a little run down. Things can
                    just get the better of us
                    sometimes. Don't you think?
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
                                APRIL
                    Yes.    Of course.
          
          Mrs. Givings smiles. Then, pretending to read the titles on
          a stack of books on the table...
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    It really is a marvellous facility
                    and the treatments seem to be doing
                    him wonders... Anyway, they said
                    getting out for an afternoon might
                    do him some good.
          
          She pauses on Sartre's `Nausea', looks at it vaguely.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    I think he finds my friends a
                    little conventional, frankly. I
                    mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD
                    in mathematics. I suppose you
                    could say he's an intellectual. It
                    would do him a world of good to
                    meet a young couple like you.
          
                              APRIL
                    We'd love to Helen.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    So, I thought perhaps if you had
                    some time...
          
                              APRIL
                    We'd love to.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                        (flushed with relief)
                    Thank you, dear... Thank you.
          
          April smiles generously.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    I remember when you first came off
                    the train. You weren't like most
                    of my clients. You were different,
                    somehow.
          
          April's face.    She's listening.
          
                                                                        20.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    Well, you looked simply ravishing
                    and I just knew Frank did something
                    terribly brilliant in town. You
                    just seemed... special... Of
                    course you still are.
          
          April takes this in.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HOUSE - AFTERNOON.
          
          April watches from the picture window as Mrs. Givings walks
          down the drive towards her car. Her face is reflected in the
          glass. Something is taking shape in her mind.
          
          
          INT. ALGONQUIN RESTAURANT BAR - AFTERNOON, LATER.
          
          The dining room is now almost empty.     Waiters and busboys eat
          in the corner.
          
          Frank cuts a solitary figure.     He lights his last cigarette
          and crumples the pack.

                    I guess you got me a little drunk.
          
          Maureen slides into the booth.     She stares at the table,
          trying to focus.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know what today is?
          
                                 MAUREEN
                    ...Monday?
          
                               FRANK
                    It's my birthday.      I'm thirty years
                    old today.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Happy birthday!
          
          Maureen raises her glass, then sways drunkenly.
          
                                                              21.
          
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    What was the name of the department
                    you made up again?
          
                              FRANK
                    Visual Aides.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    ...What-a-joke.
          
          He sips his drink.
          
                              FRANK
                    Want to hear a real joke...?
          
          She looks up at him.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    My old man worked at Knox.
          
                                 MAUREEN
                    Yeah?
          
                              FRANK
                    He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once
                    a year he used to take me into the
                    city for lunch. It was supposed to
                    be a special, life-advice sort of
                    occasion.
          
                                 MAUREEN
                    Nice.
          
                              FRANK
                    Not really... I used to sit there
                    and think, `I hope to Christ I
                    don't end up like you.'
          
          Frank grins as if it's supposed to be very funny.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    And here I am, a thirty year old
                    Knox man. Can you beat that?
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I think I kind of lost you...   Your
                    father worked for Knox...?
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                     22.
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry, but everything's kinda
                    going out of focus.
          
          Frank takes her arm to steady her.   She meets his eye.
          
                              FRANK
                    How `bout some air?
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY.
          
          Close on a hand opening an old cigar box.
          
          April is sitting with the box at the kitchen table. It
          contains various sentimental knickknacks from her past,
          including photos of the kids, of her and Frank in New York
          with friends, and a photograph of Frank in uniform beneath
          the Eifel tower on liberation day... She studies it.
          
          
          INT. BETHUNE STREET APARTMENT - DAWN, 1947. FLASHBACK
          
          Frank fixes coffee in the tiny kitchen.
          
          April is sitting up in bed in the first blue light of day
          wearing Frank's T-shirt. She holds a curled collection of
          black and white photographs in her lap. She stops on the
          same picture of Frank and the Eifel Tower.
          
          Frank comes over with the coffee, and two cigarettes.     He
          lights them both, and gives her one.
          
                              FRANK
                    You ever been to Paris?
          
                              APRIL
                    I've never really been anywhere.
          
                              FRANK
                    Maybe I'll take you with me.
          
          He lies down with his cigarette between his teeth.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I'm going back first chance I get.
                    People are alive there.
          
          He stares up at the ceiling.    She studies him.   Appraising.
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    All I know now is that I want to
                    feel things. Really feel them.
                    How's that for an ambition...?
          
                              APRIL
                    Frank Wheeler?
          
                                 FRANK
                    Mm?
          
                              APRIL
                    I think you're the most interesting
                    person I've ever met.
          
          He looks at her, overwhelmed by her face in the light.
          
                                 APRIL (CONT'D)
                    I mean it.
          
          
          INT. MAUREEN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
          
          Frank stands at the mantle tying his tie.
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, I guess this wasn't what you
                    had in mind when you went to work
                    this morning?
          
          Maureen covers herself with the sheets.
          
                               MAUREEN
                    No.   It certainly wasn't.
          
          Frank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of Maureen
          at the prom; Maureen with her parents.
          
          Maureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to
          frizz. The sheet slips down. She grabs at it. Then wills
          herself to calm down and act sophisticated.
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    Do you have a cigarette, Frank?
          
          He turns and smiles at her.
          
                                                                     24.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Sure, here.
          
          He comes over and gives her one. Lights it with his Zippo.
          She exhales, slowly gaining confidence.
          
          Frank gets up and pulls on his jacket.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Can I get you a drink or anything?
          
                              FRANK
                    No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I
                    guess I'd better be cutting out,
                    it's getting kind of late.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Gee, that's right.   Have you missed
                    your train?
          
                              FRANK
                    It's all right, I'll get the next
                    one.
          
          He comes over to her.   Bends down, kisses her gently on the
          lips.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Listen: you were swell. Take care
                    now.
          
          
          INT. FRANK'S STATION CAR/WHEELER HOUSE - NIGHT.
          
          Frank's station car turns into the driveway.     He sits there a
          moment in the darkness.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER FRONT DOOR - NIGHT.
          
          Frank approaches the door with his key. He takes a moment to
          gather himself, but before he can, the door opens.
          
          April is dressed in a black cocktail dress. She looks
          wonderful. She smiles. She steps forward and takes his face
          in her hands. She kisses him.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
                                 APRIL
                    Frank...
          
                              FRANK
                    Why are you all dressed up?
          
          She hands him a glass of whiskey and closes his fingers
          around it.
          
                              APRIL
                    First of all, I missed you all day
                    and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm
                    sorry for the way I've been since
                    that stupid play. I'm sorry for
                    everything and... And I love
                    you... Now wait here till I call
                    you. Okay?
          
          She goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence.    He takes a large
          drink.
          
          From inside the house, the sound of the children's voices.
          Whispering, giggling. Then April's voice:
          
                              APRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Alright Frank! You can come in
                    now!
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING AND DINING ROOMS - NIGHT.
          
          Frank enters the house.    Walks through the darkened living
          room towards the light.    Enters the dining room.
          
          The room is lit by the candles burning on a birthday cake.
          
          JENNIFER, 7, MICHAEL, 5, and April sit around the table
          wearing paper birthday crowns.
          
          They sing Happy Birthday.
          
          
          INT. SHOWER - NIGHT.
          
          Frank scrubs his skin, his scalp, his face: trying to wash
          away Maureen.
          
                                                                      26.
          
          
          He turns off the water.   He stands there in the silence,
          regaining control.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank steps out of the bathroom. April turns from the mirror
          wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two
          glasses.
          
                              APRIL
                    Frank. I have had the most
                    wonderful idea. I've been thinking
                    about it all day.
          
                              FRANK
                    What's all this about?
          
                              APRIL
                    You know how much money we have
                    saved...?
          
          She hands Frank a glass of brandy.
          
                               APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Enough to live on for six months
                    without you earning another dime.
                    And with the money we could get
                    from the house and the car, longer
                    than that.
          
                              FRANK
                    What we get for the house...What
                    are you talking about? Where are
                    we going to live?
          
                                APRIL
                    ...Paris.
          
          Frank stares.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    You always said it was the only
                    place you'd ever been that was
                    worth living. So why don't we go
                    there?
          
                                                            27.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You're serious?
          
                               APRIL
                    Yes.   What's stopping us?
          
                              FRANK
                    What's stopping us? Well, I can
                    think of a lot of things. For
                    instance, what kind of a job could
                    I possibly get?
          
                              APRIL
                    You won't be getting any kind of
                    job, because I will.
          
          Frank laughs.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Oh, right.
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't laugh -- listen a minute!
                    Have you any idea what they pay for
                    secretarial positions in the
                    government agencies in Europe?
                    Embassies and those things.
          
          Frank laughs again.
          
                              FRANK
                    No, I don't.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm serious about this Frank. Do
                    you think I'm kidding or something?
          
                              FRANK
                    No, I know, I know. I just have a
                    couple of questions, is all. For
                    one thing, do you mind telling me
                    what exactly I'm supposed to be
                    doing while you're out earning all
                    this money?
          
          She draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it.
          
                                                                   28.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't you see that's the whole
                    idea? You'll be doing what you
                    should've been allowed to do seven
                    years ago. You'll have time,
                    Frank. You'll have time to find
                    out what it is that you actually
                    want to do, and when you figure it
                    out you'll have the time and the
                    freedom to start doing it.
          
                              FRANK
                    Sweetheart, it's just not very
                    realistic, is all.
          
                              APRIL
                    Well, I happen to think this is
                    unrealistic. I think it's
                    unrealistic for a man with a fine
                    mind to go on working like a dog
                    year after year at a job he can't
                    stand, coming home to a place he
                    can't stand, to a wife who's
                    equally unable to stand the same
                    things.
          
          Frank is silent.   How could anyone possibly argue with her?
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    You want to know the worst part?
                    Our whole existence here is based
                    on this great premise that we're
                    somehow very special and superior
                    to the whole thing, and you know
                    what I've realized...? We're not!
                    We're just like everyone else.
                    Look at us!   We've bought into the
                    same ridiculous delusion. This
                    idea that you have to resign from
                    life and settle down the moment you
                    have children. And we've been
                    punishing each other for it.
          
                              FRANK
                    Listen: we decided to move out
                    here. No one ever forced me to
                    take the job at Knox.

                                                          29.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I mean who ever said I was supposed
                    to be a big deal, anyway?
          
                              APRIL
                    When I first met you, there was
                    nothing in the world you couldn't
                    do or be.
          
                              FRANK
                    I was a little wise guy with a big
                    mouth, that's all.
          
                              APRIL
                    You were not! How can you even say
                    that?
          
                              FRANK
                    ...All right... So, I'll have
                    time. And God knows that's
                    appealing. It's very appealing.
                    And I mean, everything you say
                    might make a certain amount of
                    sense, if I had some definite
                    talent maybe. If I were an artist
                    or a writer.
          
                              APRIL
                    But Frank, listen to me: It's what
                    you are that's being stifled here.
                    It's what you are that's being
                    denied and denied and denied in
                    this kind of life.
          
                              FRANK
                    And what's that?
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't you know...?
          
          He looks at her.   She gazes back at him.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    You're the most valuable and
                    wonderful thing in the world...
                    You're a man.
          
                                                                   30.
          
          
          Frank looks at her. In that moment, he loves her more than
          ever before. He kisses her.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    This is our chance, Frank.   This is
                    our one chance.
          
          Beat.
          
                               FRANK
                    Okay.
          
                               APRIL
                    Okay?
          
                              FRANK
                    Why not...? Why the hell not?
          
          April throws her arms around him.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, ELEVATOR BAY - MORNING.
          
          DING. The elevator doors slide open.   Frank steps onto the
          fifteenth floor, full of energy.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING.
          
          Frank arrives at his desk.   Casually tosses his briefcase
          down. Lights a cigarette.
          
          Jack stands nearby making idle chat with office co-workers,
          ED SMALL, 36 and VINCE LATHROP, 33 - a pair of overgrown
          children.
          
                              JACK
                    Ah, Franklin. Good to see your
                    shining face.  What's the news?
          
                              FRANK
                    I'm moving to Paris.
          
                               JACK
                    Right.   And I'm moving to Tangiers.
          
          Frank shrugs, smiles, picks up the Toledo file, scans it.
          
                                                                   31.
          
          
          He reaches for his Dictaphone and clears his throat.
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Intra-company letter to
                    Toledo... Attention B.F. Chalmers,
                    branch manager... With regard to
                    recent and repeated correspondence,
                    this is to advise that the matter
                    has been... very satisfactorily
                    taken in hand, period, paragraph.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We wholly agree that the existing
                    brochure is unsuitable. To this
                    end we have developed...
          
          He lights the cigarette with a SNAP of his Zippo.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    "Speaking of Production Control..."
          
          Smiles. He's making it up as he goes, and enjoying it.   It's
          all meaningless now!
          
          
          INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE - DAY.
          
          April sits in the American Express office.
          
                              CLERK (O.S.)
                    Here you are Mrs. Wheeler:
          
          A handsome CLERK smilingly hands her a stack of documents.
          
                              CLERK (CONT'D)
                    Here's the travellers checks you
                    asked for... and your steamer
                    reservations... and these I'll pass
                    on to the embassy for you.
          
                                 APRIL
                    Thank you.
          
          She looks at them in her hands: it's real.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
                                 CLERK
                    Good luck.
          
          April smiles.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY.
          
          Jack, Frank, Ed and Vince sit crammed in a booth in a tiny,
          crowded Midtown Luncheonette.
          
          Frank looks pleased with himself.    The rest sit in stunned
          silence.
          
                              JACK
                    And when does this noble experiment
                    commence?
          
                                 FRANK
                    September.     October at the outside.
          
          Jack and Vince exchange a look.
          
          Frank's enjoying the effect.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I just happen to think people are
                    better off doing some kind of work
                    they actually like.
          
                              ED
                        (vague)
                    Right, yes.
          
                              VINCE
                        (mumbled)
                    Absolutely, absolutely.
          
                              JACK
                    But... I mean, assuming there is a
                    true vocation waiting for you.
                    Wouldn't you be just as likely to
                    discover it here as there?
          
          A waitress puts the check on the table.
          
                                                                    33.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    No... I don't think it's possible
                    to discover anything on the
                    fifteenth floor of the Knox
                    building, and I don't think any of
                    you do either.
          
          The men are silent.   Frank picks up the check.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    This one's on me.
          
          
          EXT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Frank is standing leaning against a coffee bar in Grand
          Central Station. He is finishing a beer.
          
          It is rush hour, and amidst the sea of people, he is the only
          one not moving.
          
          He is watching all the people walking by with an air of
          detached amusement. As if he were now above them all.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE BETWEEN TRAIN CARS - AFTERNOON.
          
          Frank rides between train cars. The wind whips his hair. He
          takes a deep pull from a pinched cigarette - then flicks it
          straight as a bullet into the passing countryside.
          
          He feels alive.
          
          
          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON.
          
          The commuter train slows into the station. A door swings
          open. And Frank leaps from the still moving train onto the
          platform. He slows to a walk.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          The kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler,
          shrieking with pleasure.
          
          April sits on the steps in front of the house reading some
          material from the American Express office.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
          She looks up as Frank's car pulls into the drive. He steps
          out of the car and comes towards her. She looks up and
          smiles. He drops his brief case on the ground and walks
          towards her. She meets him in the middle of the lawn, and
          they embrace.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING.
          
          CLOSE UP - two fingers walk the journey from New York to
          Paris across the page of an atlas.
          
          Michael and Jennifer, dressed for bed, sit sandwiched between
          April and Frank under the bedclothes.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...All the way to... here.
          
          A pause as the two kids stare at the Atlas.
          
                               JENNIFER
                    But why?
          
                              APRIL
                    Well, sweetheart. It's a big world
                    out there and we thought maybe we
                    should go see a little bit of it.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How far is it?
          
                              APRIL
                    A long way. We have to take a
                    boat ride over the sea to get
                    there.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I won't know anyone there.
          
                              APRIL
                    I know. And neither will I. But
                    remember when you started school?
                    And now look how many friends you
                    have...
          
          Frank senses that they are a little concerned.   April and
          Frank look to one another.
          
                                                                    35.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You'll never guess what they eat in
                    Paris. You'll never guess...
          
                               JENNIFER
                    What?
          
                               FRANK
                    Snails.
          
                               JENNIFER/MICHAEL
                    Snails?!
          
                              APRIL
                    And frog's legs!
          
          The children dissolve into disgusted laughter.    April and
          Frank laugh with them.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL FRONT HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          At the bottom of the stairs, Shep hums a big band number as
          he vigorously shines his shoes.
          
                              SHEP
                    Buddappa banh!     Banh!   Banh!
          
          He takes a swig of beer and lets out a satisfied belch.
          
          
          INT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          Milly sits at a vanity table doing her face. She wears a
          floral dress and her hair's been done. She looks at Shep in
          the mirror.
          
                               MILLY
                    You better get changed, they'll be
                    here soon.
          
                              SHEP
                    That what you're wearing?
          
                              MILLY
                        (panic)
                    Don't you like it?
          
                                                                     36.
          
          
                             SHEP
                    ...No... No. You look great,
                    doll. Guess I better haul ass.
          
          He walks into the bathroom.    Milly looks back at her
          reflection.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          The small explosion of a beer can opening.
          
          Shep watches the golden liquid fill his glass.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep walks through the living room with his glass of beer.
          He's halfway across the room, before he notices -
          
          His four SONS dressed in matching pajamas, propped up on
          their elbows chewing gum at the television screen.
          
                                 SHEP
                    Hiya gang.
          
          They don't even look up.
          
          
          EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING.
          
          Shep walks across the grass to the edge of his property. He
          drinks and looks down over Revolutionary Road. He can see
          the Wheeler house. He takes a drink of beer, his eyes
          focused on the house.
          
                                 MILLY (O.S.)
                    Shep?
          
          Shep wheels around. April and Frank are standing there with
          Milly. April wears a new indigo silk dress. Her hair moves
          in the warm breeze. She's never looked better.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Shep mixes drinks with his back to the room.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          Milly walks in and places two heaping trays of hors d'ouvres
          on the coffee table.
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh those look great.    I'm starving!
          
          April helps herself.
          
                              MILLY
                    April, I can't get over it - you
                    look like the cat who ate the
                    canary! Do you have something to
                    tell us? A little bit of news?
          
                              SHEP
                        (disapproving)
                    Not to pry or anything.
          
                              MILLY
                        (suddenly unsure)
                    I'm not prying. Am I prying?    I
                    didn't mean to.
          
                              FRANK
                    Actually, we have got some pretty
                    important news.
          
          Shep and Milly look up expectantly.
          
          He smiles conspiratorially at April.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You want to tell `em?
          
          April smiles back at him.
          
                              APRIL
                    We're going to Europe.    To Paris...
                    To live.
          
          Milly's face drops.    Shep is frozen.
          
          Overlapping:
          
                                 MILLY
                    What?
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                                  SHEP
                     When?
          
                                  MILLY
                     Why?
          
                                  FRANK
                     September.
          
          Beat.   Then:
          
                               MILLY
                     But what for?
          
                               FRANK
                     What for? Because we've always
                     wanted to. Because the kids are
                     still young. Because it's
                     beautiful. Shep, you tell her.
          
                               SHEP
                     ...It's a great city.
          
          Milly glances nervously at Shep.
          
                               MILLY
                     When did you make this decision?
          
                               APRIL
                     Oh... about a week ago... its hard
                     to remember. We just suddenly
                     decided to go, that's all.
          
                               MILLY
                     About a week ago, and you tell us
                     now!
          
                               APRIL
                     We had to get used to the idea.
          
          Shep forces himself across the room and hands the Wheelers
          their drinks.
          
                               SHEP
                     So, what's the deal, Frank? You
                     get a job over there, or what?
          
                                                        39.
          
          
                            FRANK
                      (smiles)
                  No. Not exactly.
          
                            SHEP
                  What do you mean, `not exactly?'
          
                            APRIL
                  Frank won't be doing any kind of a
                  job, because I will.
          
                            SHEP
                      (to Frank)
                  And what are you going to do?
          
                            FRANK
                  I'm going to study... and I'm going
                  to read and... I suppose I'm going
                  to finally figure out what I want
                  to do with my life.
          
                            SHEP
                  ...While she supports you?
          
          Beat.
          
                            FRANK
                  Yes. While she supports me...   At
                  least in the beginning.
          
                            APRIL
                  You wouldn't believe what they pay
                  for secretarial work in government
                  agencies over there. NATO and
                  E.C.A. and those places.
          
                             FRANK
                  The cost of living is dirt cheap
                  compared to here, so we should be
                  all right.
          
          Beat.
          
                             APRIL
                  The truth is we just need something
                  different.

                               APRIL (CONT'D)
                     We're not getting any younger and
                     we don't want life to just pass us
                     by.
          
                               MILLY
                     Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I
                     mean it; it really sounds
                     wonderful. We'll certainly miss
                     you, though - won't we, sweetie?
                     Golly.
          
                                SHEP
                     Sure.
          
                                MILLY
                     Paris.   Wow.
          
          A   silence.   Shep's face.
          
          
          INT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Milly sits on the edge of the bed in her night gown.   She is
          brushing her hair.
          
          Shep stands in the open doorway to the bathroom, doing up his
          pyjamas. After a beat...
          
                               SHEP
                     You know what I think?
          
          Milly looks up.
          
                               SHEP (CONT'D)
                     I think this whole plan sounds a
                     little immature.
          
          Milly's face brightens.
          
                               MILLY
                     Oh God, I'm so relieved. Me too...
                     I was thinking that the whole time.
          
                               SHEP
                     What kind of man is going to sit
                     around in his bathrobe picking his
                     nose while his wife works all day?
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
                              MILLY
                    I don't know, Shep.   I just don't
                    know.
          
          Milly is crying.
          
                              SHEP
                    What is it?
          
                               MILLY
                    Nothing.   I'm just so relieved.
          
          He sits down beside her.   She falls into his arms.
          
                              SHEP
                    Come on. Don't cry. Please. It's
                    all right. It's going to be all
                    right.
          
          A kid's shout from somewhere in the house.     Milly sits up.
          
                               SHEP (CONT'D)
                    I'll go.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT.
          
          Frank and April burst into the kitchen, laughing.
          
          
                               FRANK
                    Jesus, their faces! You'd think
                    we'd told them that we were
                    swimming up the Yangtzee river or
                    something.
          
          Laughing, April hands Frank a drink.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You know what this is like, April?
                    Talking like this? The whole idea
                    of taking off to Europe this way?
                    It's like the way I felt going up
                    to the line the first time, in the
                    war. I was probably just as scared
                    as everyone else, but inside I
                    never felt better. I felt alive. I
                    felt full of blood.

                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    And everything looked more real.
                    The guys in their uniforms. The
                    snow on the fields, the trees. And
                    all of us just... walking. I mean
                    I was scared of course. But I kept
                    thinking: this is it. This is the
                    truth.
          
                              APRIL
                    I felt that way once too.
          
          He looks at her.   And there's something in her eyes.
          
                                 FRANK
                    When?
          
                              APRIL
                    The first time you made love to me.
          
          He walks over to her and kisses her passionately.
          
          And they make love that way, face to face, with the lights
          on, looking into each other's eyes, fully clothed, until he
          comes inside her.
          
          As he comes, she makes a sound, almost inaudible, but it
          sounds like...
          
                                 APRIL (CONT'D)
                    ...No
          
          He holds her, breathing heavily.    She strokes his head.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR - DAY.
          
          Frank walks across the 15th floor, the atmosphere unusually
          abuzz.
          
          He arrives in his cubicle. Jack, Ed and Vance are talking in
          hushed tones.
          
                                 FRANK
                    What's up?
          
                              ED
                    Bart Pollock is here.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
                              VINCE
                    He's in Bandy's office.
          
                              FRANK
                        (unimpressed)
                    Yeah?
          
          A small signal light illuminates on Frank's desk.
          
                              ED
                    Looks like he wants to talk to you.
          
          Frank looks around. They're all looking at him.     He looks
          over in the direction of Bandy's office.
          
                               JACK
                    Hey.   Keep my name out of it.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Bandy looks up from his desk.   An uncharacteristic smile.
          
                               BANDY
                        (warm)
                    Frank. How are you? You know Bart
                    Pollock?
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, we've never met, but -
          
          A massive MAN in tan gaberdine rises up from a chair.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Glad to know you Frank.
          
          He holds a file in his enormous hand.
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Speaking of production control?
          
          Frank looks away, ready for a dressing down.
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Frank... This is a crackerjack.
                    They're just tickled to death in
                    Toledo.
          
                                                                      44.
          
          
          He slaps the file on the desk.    Frank can't believe it.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY.
          
          Close of a book: "Brighter French."
          
          Frank sits on the couch, flipping absently.
          
                              FRANK
                    You wouldn't have believed this
                    guy.
          
          April enters carrying a plate of sandwiches.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    He's perfect Presidential material
                    in the worst sense. A million
                    dollar smile and about three pounds
                    of muscle between his ears.
                        (mimicking Pollock's
                         booming voice)
                    "Frank, this is a crackerjack."
          
          April looks around to be sure everything's in place.
          
                              APRIL
                    Wish I saw his face when you told
                    him you were leaving.
          
          Frank looks away.
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Horse's ass.
          
          TOOT of a car horn.   April goes to the window.
          
                              APRIL
                    I think this is them.
          
          
          INT./EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY.
          
          Through the picture window, we see the Givings' car is parked
          in the driveway.
          
          Mrs. Givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covered
          baking pan. Mr. Givings opens the backseat.
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
          Out steps JOHN, 30's, an institutional haircut and ill-
          fitting suit. He looks around the sunny neighborhood.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY.
          
          The kitchen is suddenly crowded with the Givings, Frank and
          April.
          
          Overlapping:
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Sorry to be late.
          
                              APRIL
                    You're not late.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    The traffic was terrible.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Good to see you.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Wasn't it terrible, Howard?
          
                                MR. GIVINGS
                    Route 12.
          
          Hands are shook, the baking dish exchanged.
          
                              APRIL
                    You didn't have to do that.
          
                              FRANK
                    The time they finish that stretch
                    of road, they'll have to start all
                    over again.
          
          John stands by himself closest to the door.
          
                              APRIL
                    And you must be John?
          
          Silence settles over the room.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Say hello, John.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
                              JOHN
                    Nice to meetcha.   Heard a lot
                    aboutcha.
          
          John smiles, exposing a mouthful of deeply-stained yellow
          teeth and high, eroded gums.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY.
          
          Mrs. Givings leads the group into the living room.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Where are your darling children?
          
                              APRIL
                    They're at a birthday party.     Sorry
                    they couldn't be here.
          
          John walks around the room, stiff-legged, examining the book
          shelves, the paintings.
          
                              JOHN
                    Don't worry. If I had a certified
                    lunatic coming around the house,
                    I'd probably get the kids out of
                    the way too.
          
          April and Frank exchange a quick glance.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, look at all this food! You
                    didn't have to go to any trouble
                    for us.
          
                              APRIL
                    It's just some sandwiches.
          
          April lifts the plate and offers it to John.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    John, would you like a sandwich?
          
          He avoids her look, but he takes four.
          
                              JOHN
                    Helen's been talking it up about
                    you people for months.

                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    The nice young Wheelers on
                    Revolutionary Road, the nice young
                    Revolutionaries on Wheeler road.
          
          Polite laughter.
          
                              FRANK
                    Who'd like some sherry?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Please, don't bother Frank.
          
                              JOHN
                    I'd like some sherry. And I'll
                    drink Helen's if she doesn't beat
                    me to it.
          
          April can't suppress a smile.
          
                               JOHN (CONT'D)
                        (suddenly serious)
                    But, hey... Listen, though. You
                    got a high-ball glass...? Put a
                    couple-three ice cubes in it, pour
                    it up to the brim. That's the way
                    I like it.
          
                              FRANK
                    I think I can do that.
          
          Mr. Givings eats his sandwich, watching his son.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, this is the most wonderful egg
                    salad, April. You must tell me how
                    you fix it.
          
          Frank hands John his high-ball glass.
          
                              JOHN
                    You a lawyer Frank?
          
                              FRANK
                    No, I'm not.
          
                              JOHN
                    I could use a lawyer.
          
                                                             48.
          
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    John, let's not get started again
                    about the lawyer.
          
                              JOHN
                    Pop, couldn't you just sit there
                    and eat your wonderful egg salad,
                    and quit horning in?
          
          Mr. Givings gives his son a level, warning look.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    See, I've got a good many questions
                    to ask and I'm willing to pay for
                    the answers... Now, I don't need
                    to be told that a man who goes
                    after his mother with a coffee
                    table is putting himself in a weak
                    position legally; that's obvious.
          
          Frank and April exchange a look.

                    John, come and have a look out this
                    fabulous picture window.
          
          Mrs. Givings gets up and goes to the window.
          
                              JOHN
                    If he hits her with it and kills
                    her, that's a criminal case.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
          
                              JOHN
                    If all he does is break the coffee
                    table and give her a certain amount
                    of aggravation and she decides to
                    go to court over it, that's a civil
                    case.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John,
                    come have a look.
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
                              JOHN
                    Ma, how about doing everybody a
                    favor? How about shutting up!
          
          April's face.   She's not smiling now.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Steady down, now.
          
          With her back to the room, Mrs. Givings closes her eyes.
          
                              FRANK
                    I can look into it.   Maybe
                    recommend someone.
          
          John stares at Frank for any sign of condescension.
          
                              JOHN
                    So, what do you do, Frank?
          
                              FRANK
                    I work for Knox Business Machines.
          
                              JOHN
                    You design the machines?
          
                               FRANK
                    Nope.
          
                              JOHN
                    Make `em, sell `em, repair `em?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    All these questions.
          
                              FRANK
                    I sort of help sell them, I guess.
                    I work in the office. Actually,
                    it's sort of a stupid job. I mean
                    there's nothing ­ you know,
                    interesting about it or anything.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, Frank...
          
                              JOHN
                    Whaddya do it for then?
          
                                                                   50.
          
          

                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Maybe Frank doesn't want to be
                    questioned like this, son.
          
                              JOHN
                    Okay, okay, okay ­ I know it's none
                    of my business. And besides, I
                    know the answer. You want to play
                    house, you got to have a job. You
                    want to play very nice house, very
                    sweet house, then you got to have a
                    job you don't like. Anyone comes
                    along and asks "Whaddya do it for?'
                    he's probably on a four-hour pass
                    from the State funny farm. All
                    agreed...? Ma?
          
          Frank laughs.
          
          John smiles his yellow grin.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Sorry, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't be. I agree with everything
                    you said, John. We both do.
                    That's why I'm quitting the job in
                    the fall and we're taking off.
          
                              APRIL
                    We're moving to Paris.
          
          John looks over at his mother.
          
                              JOHN
                    Did you know about this, Ma...?
                    Wow. How do you feel about that,
                    Ma? The nice young Wheelers are
                    taking off!
          
          John bursts into a painful braying laugh.   It goes on and on.
          
          Mrs. Givings brings a hand to her brow - she's on the verge
          of tears.
          
                                                                      51.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    ...John, please.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Steady down, son.
          
          April looks at Frank - the whole thing is in danger of going
          off the rails.
          
                              FRANK
                    How about some fresh air, John?
          
          John stops laughing abruptly.    He looks to his parents.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    If that's all right with you?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I don't know if it's a good idea.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    ...If John wants to, I don't see
                    the harm.
          
          
          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY.
          
          Frank, April and John walk through the woods.
          
          The ground is freshly rained on and damp.    The sun is bright.
          
          John buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down
          over his hands.
          
                              APRIL
                    I hear you're a mathematician.
          
                              JOHN
                    You hear wrong.     It's all gone now.
          
                                APRIL
                    All gone?
          
                              JOHN
                    You know what electrical shock
                    treatments are?
          
                                                                       52.
          
          
                               APRIL
                    Yes.   Yes I do.
          
                              JOHN
                    I've had thirty-seven.
          
          He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April.
          
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                    See?
          
          There are scars on his forehead.       April can see them.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional
                    Problems.' Just jolted out the
                    mathematics.

          
                                 APRIL
                    How awful.
          
                              JOHN
                        (mimicking)
                    `How awful...' Why, because
                    mathematics is so `interesting?'
          
                              APRIL
                    No. Because the shocks must be
                    awful and... well, because it's
                    awful not to be able to do what it
                    is you want to do. I think
                    mathematics are dull.
          
          John stares at April.    He smiles.
          
                              JOHN
                    I like your girl, Frank.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Me too.
          
                              JOHN
                    So, what do a couple of people like
                    you have to run away from?
          
                              FRANK
                    We're not running.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          John comes to a stop.
          
                              JOHN
                    And what's in Paris?
          
                              APRIL
                    A different way of life.
          
                              FRANK
                    So maybe we are running... We're
                    running from the hopeless emptiness
                    of the whole life here.
          
                              JOHN
                    The hopeless emptiness? Now,
                    you've said it. Plenty of people
                    are on to the emptiness, but it
                    takes real guts to see the
                    hopelessness... Wow.
          
          John continues walking.   Frank and April watch him go.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DUSK.
          
          Frank and April at the kitchen table.
          
                              APRIL
                    You know, he's the first person who
                    seemed to know what we were talking
                    about.
          
                              FRANK
                    That's true. Maybe we are just as
                    crazy as he is.
          
                               APRIL
                    If being crazy means living life as
                    if it matters then I don't care if
                    we are completely insane.
                        (beat)
                    Do you?
          
                              FRANK
                    No.
          
                              APRIL
                    I love you so much.
          
                                                                    54.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY
          
          The small, attractive house bathed in sunlight.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON.
          
          Frank follows Bart Pollock as he cuts a swathe through an
          impressive midtown eatery. A small MAITRE D' scuttles in
          front of them. Bart nods, points at well-wishers, and makes
          a politician's show of knowing the staff.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Tell you something, Frank. I'm a
                    little sore at Bandy for the way
                    he's kept you under a bushel all
                    these years. This place okay, for
                    you?
          
          Frank smirks at the performance.
          
                              FRANK
                    This is just fine, sir.   Fine.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - LATER.
          
          Bart Pollock sits across an expanse of white tablecloth
          gripping a martini glass in one of his enormous paws.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    One thing interests me, Frank, and
                    one thing only: selling the
                    electronic computer to the American
                    businessman...
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    That's why I'm assembling a team.
                    Men like you, not your average
                    salesmen... It'll mean more money,
                    and I got to be honest, maybe more
                    of a time commitment. But you'll
                    be part of something exciting,
                    Wheeler... Computers.
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, sir, it sounds exciting.
          
                                                                    55.
          
          
                               BART POLLOCK
                    Bart!
          
                               FRANK
                    Bart...
          
          Frank looks down at his plate.   He can't help himself.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Do you happen to remember an Earl
                    Wheeler?
          
          Bart looks at him blankly.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Out of Yonkers?
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Can't say that I do. Relation of
                    yours?
          
                              FRANK
                    My father. He worked at Knox
                    almost twenty years.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                        (thinking)
                    Earl Wheeler... Earl Wheeler...
          
                              FRANK
                    No reason you would have heard of
                    him.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Well, I'm sure he was a good man.
          
          Frank smiles.   Looks down.
          
                              FRANK
                    There's something I should have
                    mentioned earlier... I'm leaving
                    the firm. In the fall.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Another outfit?
          
                              FRANK
                    No, it's not another outfit --
          
                                                          56.
          
          
          Bart holds up his hands.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Now look, Frank. Is it a question
                    of money? Because if it is,
                    there's no reason we can't get
                    together on a satisfactory ­
          
                              FRANK
                    I appreciate that, but it's not
                    money. It's more of a personal
                    thing.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    A personal thing? I see.
                        (looks down, clearly
                         disapproving)
                    Frank... Let me tell you something
                    my father told me... A man only
                    gets a couple chances in life. If
                    he doesn't grab `em by the balls,
                    it won't be long before he finds
                    himself sitting around wondering
                    how he got to be second rate.
          
          Frank's face.
          
                              FRANK
                    I guess so.
          
          Bart lets it hang.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    So, do me a favor... Sleep on it.
                    Discuss it with your wife. Because
                    let's face it: where the hell would
                    any of us be without our wives,
                    anyway?
          
          On Frank's face.
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    And Frank, in all sincerity, if you
                    do decide to join us, I believe
                    it'll be a thing you'll never
                    regret.

                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    And I believe something else, too.
                    I believe it'd be a fine memorial
                    to your Dad.
          
          Frank finds himself surprised by his welling up of emotion.
          
          
          INT. KNOX BUILDING - EVENING.
          
          It's late. Frank is sitting in his cubicle over his
          Dictaphone. Jack is long gone.
          
                              FRANK
                    Knowing what you've got, comma,
                    knowing what you need, comma,
                    Knowing what you can do without,
                    dash. That's inventory control.
          
          He stubs out a cigarette in an overflowing ashtray.
          
          Close on his face.
          
          Maureen stops by Frank's cubicle.   She pretends to be
          surprised to see him.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Oh, hi Frank. Working late?
          
                              FRANK
                    I got to dig myself out here.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I heard you were getting promoted.
          
          Frank shrugs, no big deal.
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    Big shot. I guess your Dad would
                    have been real proud, huh?
          
                              FRANK
                        (surprised she remembered)
                    Huh. Yeah, I guess so...
          
                              MAUREEN
                        (smiles sweetly)
                    So...
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                    58.
          
                               MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    maybe I should buy you a drink or
                    something? You know...?
                    Celebrate.
          
          Frank's face.   We don't know which way he'll go.   He smiles.
          
                               FRANK
                    Yeah.   Maybe.
          
          She smiles.   She can't quite believe it.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I'll just get my coat.
          
          Frank sits there a moment longer, thinking.    Then he follows.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - DAY.
          
          On a television. Elmer Fudd points a gun at Bugs Bunny, and
          pulls the trigger.
          
          Frank frowns into his French phrase book.   Mike is watching
          the TV.
          
          April works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning beside
          her. Jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed Giraffe
          and a list, which she reads.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'm going to take my doll carriage
                    and my bear and my three Easter
                    rabbits and my giraffe and all my
                    dolls and my doll house.
          
                              APRIL
                    I thought maybe we'd give the doll
                    house to Madeline.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    No! I don't want to give it to
                    Madeline.
          
          April has to stop to re-thread and she's losing patience.
          
                                                                  59.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    I already explained to you, the big
                    things are going to be hard to
                    pack.
          
          Frank lowers the book.   He recognizes her tone.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    But Madeline can have my bear and
                    my Easter rabbits -
          
                              APRIL
                    No! Just the big things. Look.
                    Wouldn't you rather go outside and
                    play with Michael.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I don't feel like it.
          
                              APRIL
                    You've been inside all day.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I don't feel like it!
          
                               APRIL
                    Well, I don't feel like explaining
                    everything fifteen times to
                    somebody who's too bored and silly
                    to listen!
          
          Jennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset.
          
          April lets out a defeated sigh. She turns to the kitchen to
          see to the supper. Steam rises from the vegetables.
          
          Frank stands in the entrance silently watching for a moment.
          
                              FRANK
                    What's the matter?
          
                               APRIL
                    Nothing.
          
          She carries a pot of steaming, overcooked vegetables to the
          sink, slops them into a colander.
          
                                                                60.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't believe you. Did something
                    happen today or what?
          
                              APRIL
                    Nothing happened today that I
                    haven't known about for days and
                    days.
          
                                 FRANK
                    What?
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh God, Frank, please don't look so
                    dense. Do you mean you haven't
                    guessed or anything?
          
                              FRANK
                    What are you talking about?
          
          She finally stops and looks at him.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm pregnant, that's all.
          
          Beat as he absorbs it.    He's totally blind-sided.
          
                               FRANK
                    What...?   Jesus.
          
          She comes over to him.
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until
                    dinner to tell you, but I just -
                    well, I've been pretty sure all
                    week and today I went to the Doctor
                    and now I can't even pretend it's
                    not true.
          
                              FRANK
                        (still stunned)
                    Jesus... How long?
          
                                 APRIL
                    Ten weeks.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You didn't say anything.
          
                               APRIL
                    I thought... Oh, I don't know what
                    I thought.
          
          He stares, still unsure how he feels.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
          
                              FRANK
                    I know you are.
          
          She looks at him, with slight desperation.
          
                              APRIL
                    We don't have to let this stop us.
                    There are things we can do.
                    Remember that girl at school I told
                    you about...? As long as you do it
                    before 12 weeks, it's fine.
          
          He just looks at her and his silence makes her desperate.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    We've got to be together in this,
                    Frank. Otherwise nothing's going
                    to make any sense.
          
                               FRANK
                    Okay.   We'll figure it out.
          
          He takes her in his arms.
          
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                    12 weeks.    So we have time.
          
          On Frank's face... Slowly, he smiles.
          
                              APRIL
                    I love you Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    ...I love you too.
          
                                                                    62.
          
          
          EXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH - AFTERNOON.
          
          A baking hot day. The sky is electric blue. Radios PLAY,
          children CRY, dogs BARK. Sunbathers cover almost every inch
          of sand.
          
          We find Shep, Milly, Frank and April with beach chairs,
          coolers and umbrellas.
          
          A child wrapped in a towel sleeps on Milly's lap.
          
          April wears a pair of dark glasses, behind which she is
          thinking, thinking.
          
                              SHEP
                    So, Frank, how's work?   They gonna
                    survive without you?
          
                              FRANK
                    Actually... Something kinda funny
                    happened the other day. I did some
                    dumb little piece of work to get
                    myself off the hook with Bandy, and
                    suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.
          
                              SHEP
                        (laughs)
                    That's always the way, isn't it?
          
                              FRANK
                    It's incredible. I knocked this
                    thing off in a couple of minutes
                    and now they want me to join their
                    team of `specialist' salesmen.
          
                              SHEP
                    Morons.
          
                              FRANK
                    It'd be funny, if they weren't
                    talking about so much damn money.
          
          April turns and looks at Frank. Long and hard.   If he can
          feel her look, he doesn't show it.
          
                                                                    63.
          
          
                              SHEP
                        (stealing a glance at
                         April)
                    So, you tempted?
          
                               FRANK
                        (shrugs)
                    Well, it's kind of ironic, don't
                    you think?
          
          April suddenly stands up.    Frank and Shep watch her walk down
          to the water's edge.
          
                                SHEP
                    She okay?
          
          Frank stares after her.
          
          
          EXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH, WATER'S EDGE - AFTERNOON.
          
          April stands in the water staring out over the sea. The
          waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her or
          not, she's staring in the direction of Europe.
          
          Frank comes up beside her.
          
                              APRIL
                    I thought you turned the job down?
          
                              FRANK
                        (shrugs)
                    Not yet... It's just an option,
                    that's all. With the money they're
                    talking, things could be different
                    for us here. We could get a better
                    place. Travel.
          
          April shakes her head and drags on her cigarette.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Look, the point is - we could be
                    happy here. At least for a while.
          
          She stares out at the sea.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    It is possible that Parisians
                    aren't the only ones who know how
                    to lead interesting lives, April.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                              APRIL
                    So you've made up your mind?
          
                               FRANK
                    No.   Like I said, it's an option.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...And supposing you're right. You
                    make all this money and we have
                    this interesting life here. Won't
                    you still be wasting your life
                    toiling away at a job you find
                    ridiculous? Just like your father.
          
                              FRANK
                        (sharp)
                    Maybe we let that be my business.
          
                              APRIL
                        (incredulous)
                    Your business?
          
                              FRANK
                        (exhales)
                    It's too hot for this.    I'm going
                    to get wet.
          
          She just looks at him. He walks into the ocean.   She stands
          on the shore, watching him swim away from her.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          April paces the family room. Her hair is a defiant mess.
          She still wears her bathing suit under her clothes.
          
          Frank sits on the couch.
          
          The windows are open, and most of the lights are off. It's a
          very hot night.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    You don't want to go, do you?
          
                              FRANK
                    Come on, April.   Of course I do.
          
                              APRIL
                    You don't! Because you've never
                    tried at anything. And if you
                    don't try at anything you can't
                    fail.
          
                              FRANK
                    What the hell do you    mean I don't
                    try? I support you,     don't I? I
                    pay for this house.     I work ten
                    hours a day at a job    I can't stand.
          
                              APRIL
                    You don't have to!
          
                              FRANK
                    Bullshit! I'm not happy about it.
                    But I have the backbone not to run
                    away from my responsibilities!
          
                              APRIL
                    It takes backbone to lead the life
                    you want, Frank.
          
          He shakes his head and gets up.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Where are you going?
          
                              FRANK
                    Is it alright with you if I go to
                    the bathroom?
          
          She disgustedly twists out her cigarette, and immediately
          lights another.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rounds.
          He looks up at his reflection.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          He reaches for a towel, but there isn't one. He turns to the
          shelf behind him and pulls down a fresh towel. Something
          catches his eye.
          
          He reaches to the back and retrieves a small brown paper
          package.
          
          He opens it, his face slowly registering what it means...
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          April wheels around as -
          
          Frank storms in, a rubber syringe in his hand.
          
                               FRANK
                    What the hell are you going to do
                    with this?
          
                              APRIL
                    And what do you think you're going
                    to do? You're going to stop me?
          
                              FRANK
                    You're damn right!
          
                              APRIL
                    Go ahead and try!
          
          He comes at her across the room with the syringe in his hand.
          She moves away.
          
                              FRANK
                    Listen. Listen to me. You do this
                    - you do this and I swear to God
                    I'll -
          
                              APRIL
                    You'll what? You'll leave me?   Is
                    that a threat, or a promise?
          
          He shakes it in her face.
          
                              FRANK
                    When did you buy this, April?   I
                    want to know!
          
                                                          67.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    You know you really are being
                    melodramatic about the whole thing.
                    As long as it's done in the first
                    twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.
          
                              FRANK
                    That's now April!   Don't I get a
                    say?
          
                              APRIL
                    Of course you do! It would be for
                    you, Frank, don't you see? So you
                    can have time. Like we talked
                    about.
          
                              FRANK
                    How can it be for me if the thought
                    makes my stomach turn over?
          
                              APRIL
                    Then it's for me... Tell me we can
                    have the baby in Paris, Frank. But
                    don't make me stay here. Please.
          
                              FRANK
                    We can't have the baby in Paris.
          
                              APRIL
                    Why not? I don't need everything
                    we have here. I don't care where
                    we live! I mean who made these
                    rules, anyway? The only reason we
                    moved out here was because I got
                    pregnant. Then we had another
                    child to prove the first one wasn't
                    a mistake. I mean how long does it
                    go on?
          
          He turns away.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Frank. Do you actually want
                    another child? Well, do you?
          
          He won't answer.
          
                                                            68.
          
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Come on, tell me. Tell me the
                    truth, Frank. Remember that? We
                    used to live by it. You know what's
                    so good about the truth? Everyone
                    knows what it is, however long
                    they've lived without it. No one
                    forgets the truth, Frank, they just
                    get better at lying. So tell me: do
                    you really want another child?
          
          Frank turns towards her.
          
                              FRANK
                    All I know is what I feel. And
                    anyone else in their right mind
                    would feel the same way.
          
                              APRIL
                        (quiet)
                    But I've had two children.    Doesn't
                    that count in my favor?
          
                              FRANK
                    Christ! The fact that you even put
                    it that way! You make it sound
                    like having children is a
                    punishment.
          
                              APRIL
                    I love my children.
          
                              FRANK
                    And you're sure about that?
          
                              APRIL
                    What the hell is that supposed to
                    mean?
          
                              FRANK
                    April, you just said our daughter
                    was mistake. How do I know you
                    didn't try to get rid of her, or
                    Michael for that matter? How do I
                    know you didn't try to flush our
                    entire fucking family down the
                    toilet?
          
                                                                69.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    No that's not true. Of course I
                    didn't.
          
                              FRANK
                    But how do I know April?
          
                               APRIL
                    Stop.   Please just stop, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    April, a normal woman, a normal
                    sane mother doesn't buy herself a
                    piece of rubber tubing to give
                    herself an abortion so she can, go
                    live out some God damn fantasy.
          
          April's face.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                        (sober)
                    All I'm saying is you don't seem
                    entirely rational about this
                    thing... And maybe we should get
                    someone to help you think about it.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...And the new job's going to pay
                    for that too?
          
                              FRANK
                    April if you need a shrink, it'll
                    be paid for. Obviously.
          
          April turns to the book shelves.   Her back to him.
          
          Frank waits, his heart beating quickly.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...Okay. I guess there isn't much
                    more to say, then, is there?
          
          Her eyes are bright with tears.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    So I guess Paris was a pretty
                    childish idea, huh?
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          Everything hangs on Frank's answer...
          
                              FRANK
                    I guess maybe it was.
          
          April closes her eyes. Tears run down her cheeks.   He walks
          over to her, but he doesn't touch her.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We can be happy here April...   I
                    can make you happy here.
          
          She cries quietly.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We've had a great few months.   It
                    doesn't have to end...
          
          She turns to face him.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We're going to be okay.
          
                              APRIL
                    I hope so Frank.   I really hope so.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
          
          Frank stands at the picture window watching...
          
          April approach the children. She squats on the ground so she
          can be at their height and talks to them. Michael tries to
          get into her arms. Jennifer turns away and walks sulkily
          across the grass.
          
          Frank looks into his coffee cup.   He doesn't look like a man
          who won an argument.
          
          
          INT. KNOX WAITING ROOM - DAY.
          
          Frank sits smoking nervously in an oak-paneled waiting room.
          The door opens behind him. He gets to his feet.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Thank you for waiting.   Mr. Pollock
                    can see you now.
          
                                                                    71.
          
          
          He follows her through the door.    The door closes behind her.
          
          We see the scene in dumb-show through the glass door. Bart
          looks up as Frank enters. An "I knew it all along" smile
          spreads across Pollock's face. He offers his hand to Frank.
          Frank smiles thinly. They shake.
          
                              JACK (O.S)
                    Foiled by faulty contraception.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY.
          
          Frank, Ed, Vince and Jack sit in the same booth in the same
          crowded luncheonette.
          
          Frank stares out the window.   The others can't contain
          themselves.
          
                              ED
                    I can't say I'm sorry.
          
                              VINCE
                    Wouldn't have been the same without
                    you.
          
                              JACK
                    You'd have been sorely missed in
                    the old cubicle, I can tell you
                    that.
          
          He raises his glass, drinks alone.
          
                              JACK (CONT'D)
                    Besides which...
          
          Frank looks away from the window.
          
                              FRANK
                    What?
          
                              JACK
                    ...Well, the plan always seemed a
                    touch unrealistic, don't you think?
          
          Frank glares with barely contained fury.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
                              JACK (CONT'D)
                    I suppose, it's none of my
                    business, really.
          
                               FRANK
                    No.   I suppose it isn't.
          
          A beat.
          
                              JACK
                    Well, we won't be the only ones
                    glad to hear the news. They'll be
                    celebrating in the secretarial
                    pool.
          
          Ed and Vince chuckle.   Frank's face.
          
          
          INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
          
          Two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight.   They click out a
          rhythm, and crash into a number.
          
          Cut back to reveal a small, low-ceilinged joint. On-stage
          are the Steve Kovack quartet, four perspiring middle-aged men
          with day jobs.
          
          YOUNGISH COUPLES, and the odd middle-aged COUPLE navigate the
          dance floor.
          
          A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar.
          
          The Wheelers and Campbells sit squashed into a booth on the
          side of the dance floor.
          
          Several empty glasses have accumulated. Milly is beating the
          edge of the table with red drink straws. She's a few drinks
          ahead.
          
          They have to SHOUT over the MUSIC.
          
                              MILLY
                    Hey! Remember the first time you
                    brought us here? You said, it
                    takes a special kind of taste to
                    enjoy Vito's Log Cabin!
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
                              SHEP
                    It's so awful it's kinda nice!
          
                              MILLY
                    That's right!
          
          They laugh at the old joke.   Then Milly begins to weep.
          
                              MILLY (CONT'D)
                        (dabs at her eyes)
                    Look at me...! I'm just so happy.
                    Our little gang's back together
                    again!
          
          She knocks her drink back.    The number finishes.
          
                              SHEP
                    At least Europe's not going
                    anywhere.
          
          April stares out at the dance floor.    Frank looks at her.   A
          new number starts.
          
                              FRANK
                    Wanna dance?
          
                              APRIL
                    I don't really feel like it.
          
                              MILLY
                    I'll dance!
          
          Milly takes him by the hand and pulls him away. Shep and
          April watch. Then Shep turns his attention to April.
          
                              MILLY (CONT'D)
                        (tipsy)
                    Guess April's pretty blue `bout
                    Paris, huh?
          
                              FRANK
                    Think she'll be okay?
          
                              MILLY
                    Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple
                    of days and we can get over
                    anything!
          
                                                                    74.
          
          
          Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. His
          movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April.
          
          Milly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up,
          perspiring through her dress. He spins her around and
          around, back and forth into his arms. Milly begins to look
          slightly dizzy.
          
                                 MILLY (CONT'D)
                     ...Frank.
          
          He doesn't hear her over the music, or he doesn't care.
          
                               MILLY (CONT'D)
                     Frank... I...
          
                               FRANK
                         (sudden remorse)
                     You okay?
          
                               MILLY
                     Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very...
          
          Her body spasms with the need to be sick. She turns and
          rushes for the lady's room.
          
          
          EXT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
          
          Frank leads the way through the cars.
          
          Shep supports Milly who is now falling down drunk.
          
          April walks alone a few paces behind...
          
          They reach Shep's car, which is trapped behind several other
          cars.
          
                               SHEP
                     Of all the inconsiderate...
          
          A beat.   Frank looks to April.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Look - why don't you take Milly
                    home, then go home yourself and
                    that would take care of both
                    sitters. Then Shep can take me
                    home later.
          
                              SHEP
                    All right with me.
          
                              FRANK
                        (to April)
                    You'll be alright?
          
                              APRIL
                    Sure.
          
          Frank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with car
          keys in hand.
          
          
          INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
          
          Steve Kovack performs an exhausting, sweat-drenched drum
          solo.
          
          April and Shep now sit alone in the booth.
          
                              SHEP
                    I'm sorry you're not going away
                    anymore. I know it was important to
                    you.
          
          April distantly nods her thanks.
          
                              SHEP (CONT'D)
                    Don't take this wrong; I've been
                    there and...they don't have so much
                    we don't have here.
          
                              APRIL
                    It didn't have to be Paris.
          
          Shep sips his beer, trying to figure out how to connect with
          her...
          
                              SHEP
                    You just wanted out, huh?
          
                                                              76.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    I wanted in. I just wanted us to
                    live again.
          
          Shep nods, not entirely sure what she means.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    For years I thought we shared a
                    secret...that we would be wonderful
                    in the world. I didn't exactly know
                    how, but just the
                    possibility...kept me hoping.
          
          She takes a long slug of her drink.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    How pathetic is that? To put all
                    your hopes in a promise that was
                    never made? See, Frank knows...he
                    knows what he wants. He's found his
                    place. He's just fine. Married, two
                    kids. It should be enough. It is
                    for him. He's right; we were never
                    special or destined or anything at
                    all.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sure you are. You're The Wheelers.
                    You're a terrific couple, everyone
                    says so.
          
          April doesn't hear, she's pursuing her thought...
          
                               APRIL
                    I saw a different life. I can't
                    stop seeing it.
                        (beat)
                    Can't leave, can't stay.
                        (beat)
                    No damn use to anyone.
          
          April turns and stares at him.
          
          The band strikes up a new number.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Come on, let's do it.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN, DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT.
          
          April and Shep dance.
          
          Shep can't dance well, but he's trying. April, on the other
          hand, is a wonderful dancer. She dances out as far as their
          joined hands allow and does a little twitching, hip-bobbing
          curtsies before twisting back, all seemingly effortless. It
          is joyous, released.
          
          
          INT. SHEP'S CAR - NIGHT.
          
          Shep slips behind the wheel and is immediately kissing her,
          groping.
          
                              SHEP
                    Let me take you somewhere.
          
                               APRIL
                    No. Please. Here.    Now.    In the
                    back seat.
          
          She climbs into the back seat. He pulls off his jacket and
          climbs in after her. He folds the jacket under her head for
          a pillow...
          
          She remains perfectly still, allowing him to kiss her, to
          search under her clothing, to kiss her skin and finally, to
          lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and make love to
          her against the vinyl seat cover...
          
          As suddenly as it began, it's over. Shep collapses against
          her. April stares into the darkness.
          
                              SHEP (CONT'D)
                    April... This is what I've always
                    wanted... I love you.
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't say that.
          
                              SHEP
                    I mean it, I love you.
          
                              APRIL
                    Please, just be quiet for a minute,
                    then you can take me home.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          They begin to quietly assemble themselves.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Frank stands at the mirror putting on a clean shirt.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON.
          
          April stands at the kitchen table chopping vegetables.    She
          wears an unflattering floral dress.
          
          Frank stands in the doorway watching.
          
                              FRANK
                    It's beautiful out.
          
                              APRIL
                    Yes; it's lovely.
          
          
          He glances at the calendar.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know what today is?
          
          She doesn't look at him.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    It's twelve weeks.
          
                              APRIL
                    That's right.
          
          He walks over to her.   He takes her in his arms.   She
          stiffens.
          
                              FRANK
                    Look, this has been kind of a crazy
                    summer. We've both been under a
                    strain. I mean I know you're
                    upset.
          
                              APRIL
                    You know I'm not sleeping with you
                    and you want to know why?
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          She looks him straight in the eye.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't
                    really feel like talking about it.
          
          She pulls herself free of his grasp. He watches as she adds
          the vegetables in the pot on the stove.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay. What do you feel like
                    talking about?
          
                              APRIL
                    Would it be all right if we didn't
                    talk about anything? Can't we just
                    take each day as it comes, and do
                    the best we can, and not feel we
                    have to talk about everything all
                    the time?
          
          He smiles patiently.
          
                               FRANK
                    I don't think I suggested we talk
                    about everything all the time. My
                    point was, we've both been under a
                    strain and we ought to be trying to
                    help each other as much as we can
                    right now.
          
          She's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I mean God knows my own behavior
                    has been pretty weird lately... I
                    mean, as it happens... there is
                    actually something I'd like to tell
                    you about...
          
          She continues folding the napkins.
          
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I've been with a girl in the city a
                    few times.
          
          Finally, she stops moving.   She looks at him.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    A girl I hardly even know. It was
                    nothing to me, but she got a little
                    carried away. She's just a kid...
                    Anyway, it's over now. It's really
                    over. If I weren't sure of that I
                    guess I could never have told you
                    about it.
          
                              APRIL
                    Why did you?
          
                              FRANK
                        (relieved)
                    Baby, I don't know. I think it was
                    a simple case of wanting to be a
                    man again after all that abortion
                    business. Some kind of neurotic,
                    irrational need to prove something.
          
                              APRIL
                    No. I don't mean why did you have
                    the girl; I mean why did you tell
                    me about it?
          
          He is suddenly unsure.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    I mean what's the point? Is it
                    supposed to make me jealous, or
                    something? Is it supposed to make
                    me fall in love with you, or back
                    into bed with you, or what? I mean
                    what am I supposed to say?
          
          He tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing.
          
                              FRANK
                    Why don't you say what you feel?
          
                              APRIL
                    I don't feel anything.
          
                              FRANK
                    In other words you don't care what
                    I do or who I fuck or anything?
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    No; I guess that's right; I don't.
          
          She is frighteningly calm.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Fuck who you like.
          
          His panic mounts.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't you see...Don't you see, I
                    want you to care.
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I
                    would if I loved you. But you see
                    I don't think I do anymore. And I
                    only just figured that out. And
                    that's why I'd just as soon not do
                    any talking right now.
          
          She goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her.
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh, now don't give me this shit!
                    You know God damn well you love me!
          
                              APRIL
                    You think so?!
          
                              FRANK
                    You know GOD DAMN WELL!
          
                               MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)
                    Yoo-hoo!   Any one home?
          
          Frank and April stare at each other, breathless.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          Frank and the Givings' sit with cocktails. It's painfully
          awkward. Moving boxes are everywhere.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm sorry dinner's late. Can I get
                    anyone a refill?
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to
                    sit for a bit and socialize...You
                    really didn't need to go through
                    all the trouble of cooking. I can
                    see you have a lot to do with
                    packing and what not.
          
          Frank looks at April. She avoids his look.
          
                              FRANK
                    Actually, there's been a change of
                    plans.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh?
          
          John looks up.
          
          Frank looks at April.
          
                              FRANK
                    I thought maybe it was obvious...
                    April's pregnant.
          
          April manages a forced smile.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, April! I can't tell you how
                    pleased I am. Oh, but I expect
                    you'll be needing a bigger house,
                    now, won't you?
          
                              JOHN
                    Hold it a second, Ma.
          
          John gets to his feet.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    I don't get this.
          
          He fixes Frank with the stare of a prosecuting attorney.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    What's so obvious about it? I mean
                    okay, she's pregnant; so what?
                    Don't people have babies in Europe?
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
                               MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh John, really. I don't think we
                    need to --
          
          John holds up a hand.
          
                              JOHN
                    I'm asking the man a question. If
                    he doesn't want to give me the
                    answer, I'm assuming he'll have
                    sense enough to tell me so.
          
                              FRANK
                    Suppose we just say that people
                    anywhere aren't very well advised
                    to have babies unless they can
                    afford them.
          
                              JOHN
                        (nods slowly)
                    Okay. Okay; it's a question of
                    money. Money's always a good
                    reason...
          
          John paces the room, with his hands behind his back like a
          detective at a murder scene.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    But it's hardly ever the real
                    reason. What's the real reason?
                    Wife talk you out of it, or what?
          
          He turns the force of his smile on April.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Little woman decide she isn't quite
                    ready to quit playing house?
          
          She walks across the room and stabs out her cigarette.   Then
          immediately lights another.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Nah, nah, that's not it. I can
                    tell. She looks too tough. Tough
                    and female and adequate as hell.
          
          He swings around to face Frank.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Okay, then; it must've been you.
          
          Frank stares back defiantly.   Rage bubbling.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    What happened?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    John, please, you're being very --
          
          John holds up his hand.
          
                              JOHN
                    What happened, Frank? You get cold
                    feet, or what? You decide you're
                    better off here after all? You
                    figure it's more comfy here in the
                    old Hopeless Emptiness after all,
                    or --
          
          Frank's face.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Wow, that did it! Look at his
                    face! What's the matter, Wheeler?
                    Am I getting warm?
          
          Frank stares at John, his rage increasing.   Mr. Givings gets
          to his feet.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    All right, son. I think we'd
                    better be --
          
                              JOHN
                    Boy!
          
          He lets out his braying laugh.   April starts to laugh.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Boy! You know something? I
                    wouldn't be surprised if you
                    knocked her up on purpose just so
                    you could spend the rest of your
                    life hiding behind that maternity
                    dress. That way you never have to
                    find out what he's made of.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Now look, I think that's just about
                    enough out of you. I mean, who the
                    hell do you think you are? You
                    come in here and say whatever crazy
                    God damn thing comes into your head
                    and I think it's about time someone
                    told you to keep your God damn -
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    He's not well, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    Not well, my ass! I don't give a
                    damn if he's sick or well or dead
                    or alive, he should keep his
                    fucking opinions in the fucking
                    insane asylum where they belong!
          
          April stares at Frank.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Let's go, son.
          
          Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slowly
          stands. April is the only one left seated.
          
                              JOHN
                    Big man you got there, April.
          
          He winks at April and puts his hat on.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Big family man, solid citizen. I
                    feel sorry for you. Still, maybe
                    you deserve each other.
          
          April's face.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Matter of fact, the way you look
                    right now, I'm beginning to feel
                    sorry for him, too. I mean, you
                    must give him a pretty bad time, if
                    making babies is the only way he
                    can prove he's got a pair of balls.
          
                                                                  86.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You... fucking..!
          
          Frank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank back.
          Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    He's not well, Frank!
          
          Silence.   Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank.   He is
          breathing heavily.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    All right, John. Let's get on out
                    to the car now.
          
          He guides him from the room.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...
          
                              JOHN
                    Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry!
                    Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry'
                    enough times? I am sorry, too.
                    Damn; I bet I'm just about the
                    sorriest bastard I know. Course,
                    get right down to it, I don't have
                    a whole hell of a lot to be glad
                    about, do I?
          
          He takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns
          back, laughing again.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Hey, but I'm glad about one thing,
                    though.
          
          He points a yellow-stained finger at April's stomach.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    You know what I'm glad about? I'm
                    glad I'm not gonna be that kid.
          
          They go out.
          
          Frank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks
          it.
          
                                                             87.
          
          
          April watches him from across the room.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't
                    tell me; let me guess. I made a
                    Disgusting Spectacle of Myself.
                    Right?
          
                                APRIL
                    Right.
          
          He turns to April.
          
                              FRANK
                    And everything that man said is
                    True. Right? Isn't that what
                    you're going to say?
          
                              APRIL
                    Apparently I don't have to.     You're
                    saying it for me.
          
          He comes towards her.
          
                              FRANK
                    But you're wrong.
          
                              APRIL
                    Why am I wrong?
          
                              FRANK
                    Because the man is insane. He's
                    fucking insane! Do you know what
                    the definition of insanity is?
          
                              APRIL
                    What is it, Frank?
          
                              FRANK
                    The inability to relate to another
                    human being. It's the inability to
                    love.
          
          She looks at him.    Then she begins to laugh.
          
                              APRIL
                    The in -- the in; the inabil; the
                    inability to --
          
                                                                     88.
          
          
          She reels around the room, her laughter increasingly out of
          control.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a
                    wonderful talker! If black could
                    be made into white by talking,
                    you'd be the man for the job. So
                    now I'm crazy because I don't love
                    you -- right? Is that the point?
          
                              FRANK
                    No. Wrong. You're not crazy and
                    you do love me; that's the point.
          
          He takes a step towards her.
          
          All the laughter goes out of her face.   She backs away.
          
                              APRIL
                    But I don't. In fact I loathe the
                    sight of you. You're just a boy who
                    made me laugh at a party once and
                    if you come any closer, if you
                    touch me or anything I think I'll
                    scream.
          
          He takes her by the arms.
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh baby listen --
          
          She SCREAMS. High and shrill.    Her eyes wide open, cold and
          perfectly calm.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Fuck you, April. And fuck all your
                    hateful, snotty little -
          
          She slips past him.
          
          He goes after her.
          
          She pulls a chair into his path.
          
          He SLINGS it against the wall.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    What're you going to do now? Are
                    you going to hit me? To show how
                    much you love me?
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be
                    bothered! You're not worth the
                    trouble it'd take to hit you.
                    You're not worth the powder it'd
                    take to blow you up. You're an
                    empty --
          
          He begins to shake with anger.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You're an empty, hollow fucking
                    shell of a woman. What the hell
                    are you living in my house for if
                    you hate me so much? Huh? Will
                    you answer me that? Why the hell
                    do you fuck me? What the hell are
                    you carrying my child for?
          
          He points at her belly.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Why the hell didn't you just get
                    rid of it, when you had the chance?
                    Because listen. Listen: I got news
                    for you. I wish to God you had.
          
          He strides out of the room.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING.
          
          Frank enters the bedroom and slams the door.
          
          He paces, slowly calming.
          
          He sits on the bed with his head in his hands... His mind
          racing. Then he's on his feet again. He rushes for the
          door.
          
                                                                   90.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - EVENING.
          
          Frank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty.   Frank runs
          out of the room into living room.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          The living room is empty.   He goes straight for the front
          door.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - EVENING.
          
          Frank bursts out the front and comes to a stop.
          
          She's across the street - climbing unsteadily into the
          woods...
          
          Frank breaks into a sprint.
          
          
          EXT. WOODS - EVENING.
          
          April walks through the woods.
          
          Frank runs up behind her, scrambling through the muddy
          bracken.
          
          April wheels around.
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't come any closer.
          
                              FRANK
                    April, listen, I --
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't come any closer. Can't I
                    even get away from you in the
                    fucking woods?
          
          He stops moving.
          
                              FRANK
                    April, listen, I didn't mean that.
                    Honestly; I didn't mean what I
                    said.
          
                                                                     91.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Are you still talking? Isn't there
                    any way to stop your talking? I
                    NEED to think. Can't you see that?
          
          She backs up against a tree trunk, looking down at him.
          
                              FRANK
                    Please come back.     What're you
                    doing out here?
          
                              APRIL
                    Do you want me to scream again,
                    Frank? Because I will, if you say
                    another word! I mean it!
          
          Frank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would
          hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then
          turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he
          goes.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods
          where he left April.
          
          Then, he sees her come back across the street. She walks
          around the side of the house. He turns and runs into the
          kitchen.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - NIGHT.
          
          Frank goes to the window. He watches April walk up into the
          yard and stop against a tree.
          
          Frank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the
          window. He looks out, drinking.
          
          In the darkness, he can make out the glow of April's
          cigarette deep in the woods.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER.
          
          Frank falls back on the bed.
          
                                                                      92.
          
          
          He's now very drunk.
          
          His eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
          
          Frank wakes alone.     He looks around the room.   His head is
          throbbing.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
          
          Frank stands in the doorway dressed for work.      He stares...
          
          The kitchen has been tidied and is bathed in sunlight.     The
          table has been carefully set for two.
          
          April stands at the stove wearing a fresh maternity dress.
          She seems serene.
          
          April turns and looks at him.
          
                              APRIL
                    Good morning.
          
                              FRANK
                    Good morning.
          
          He stands there frozen.
          
                              APRIL
                    Would you like scrambled eggs or
                    fried?
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh. It doesn't really matter -
                    Uh... scrambled, I guess, if it's
                    easy.
          
                               APRIL
                    Fine.   I'll have scrambled too.
          
          Frank sits at the table.
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING, MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Frank and April sit across the kitchen table, eating.   For
          several moments, only the sound of their cutlery.
          
                                 FRANK
                       It's kinda nice having breakfast
                       without the kids for a change.
          
          April reaches out to pour him some orange juice.   Her hands
          shake slightly.
          
                                 APRIL
                       Yes. I thought you'd probably want
                       a good breakfast today. I mean it's
                       kind of an important day for you,
                       isn't it? Isn't this the day you
                       have your conference with Pollock?
          
                                 FRANK
                           (surprised)
                       Yes. That's right, yes.
          
          He shrugs.
          
                                   FRANK (CONT'D)
                       Big deal.
          
                                 APRIL
                       I imagine it is a pretty big deal;
                       for them, anyway. What exactly do
                       you think you'll be doing? You
                       never have told me much about it.
          
                                 FRANK
                       Haven't I? Well... I think this
                       whole thing is about Knox getting
                       ready to buy up one of these really
                       big computers, bigger than the
                       `500'. Did I tell you about that?
          
                                 APRIL
                       No, I don't believe you did.
          
                                                                       94.
          
          
                                 FRANK
                       Well, you know -- Basically it's
                       just a...a big, fast adding
                       machine. Only...
          
          He takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately
          sketches the computer on the napkin.
          
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                       Instead of mechanical parts, you
                       see, it's got thousands of little
                       individual vacuum tubes.
          
          She picks up the drawing and looks at it.       It's surprisingly
          delicate.
          
                                 APRIL
                       Oh, I see. At least I think I see;
                       yes. It's really sort of --
                       interesting, isn't it?
          
                                 FRANK
                       Well, I don't know, it's -- yeah, I
                       guess it is sort of interesting, in
                       a way.
          
                                 APRIL
                       You should value what you do Frank.
                       You're obviously good at it.
          
          He smiles, flattered and surprised.    He slips the pencil into
          the inside pocket of his suit.
          
                                 FRANK
                       Guess I'd better be getting
                       started.
          
          He stands.    April stands up too, smoothing her skirt.
          
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                       Listen, though, April; this was
                       really nice... I mean it was a
                       swell breakfast. Really; I don't
                       know when I've ever had a -- a
                       nicer breakfast.
          
                                                                        95.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it
                    too.
          
          They stand there gazing at one another across the table.
          Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears.
          
          He turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the
          handle and turns back once more.
          
                              FRANK
                    Then you don't -- You don't hate
                    me, or anything?
          
                              APRIL
                    No; of course I don't.
          
          She comes over to him.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Have a good day.
          
          He leans down and kisses her tenderly.   They look at one
          another a moment longer.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay, then... So long.
          
          He steps through the door. She catches the door before it
          shuts and watches him through the screen.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
          
          April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away
          down the drive.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING.
          
          Frank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into
          drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
          
          April sees Frank looking back at her.    She waves.   Frank
          waves from the car and drives off...
          
                                                                    96.
          
          
          Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill.
          She turns and looks back at the house.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
          
          April enters through the screen door and goes to the table.
          She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it
          aside.
          
          She carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them.
          
          Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from
          crying. And then there is no stopping the tears...
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
          
          April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the
          receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials.
          
                             APRIL
                    Hello... Milly? Everything all
                    right? My voice sounds what...?
          
          April uses both hands to grip the receiver.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not
                    feeling any better... If it's not
                    an inconvenience for you... This
                    evening would be great. What...?
                    Oh, well- no, not if they're
                    outdoors playing. Don't call them
                    in.
          
          The cigarette shreds in April's hand.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Just give them - you know, give
                    them each a kiss for me, and give
                    them my love, and tell them - you
                    know... All right, Milly. Thanks.
          
          She hangs up and begins to cry again.   Takes a breath.
          
                                                                     97.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
          
          FOOTSTEPS...
          
          We move behind April as she walks through the silent house.
          
          The distant SOUND of children playing outside.
          
          Each room she passes is a pocket of silence.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
          
          April makes the bed.
          
          She arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet.
          
          April reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes.   Pulls out
          the brown paper package.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
          
          April stands at the stove over a pot of rolling, boiling
          water.
          
          She removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and
          drops it into the pot. She checks her watch.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
          
          April carries the pot of boiling, sudsy water down the hall.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY.
          
          April places the pot into the tub.   She lays towels across
          the floor. And closes the door...
          
          
          INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY, MOMENTS LATER.
          
          The SOUND of running water. The empty mirror.     April's face
          rises up into the reflection with a gasp.
          
                                                                       98.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
          
          We move with April down the hallway, her face is pale.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY, LATER.
          
          Now April stands at the picture window.    She is shaking.
          
          A DROPLET of blood slides down her knee.   She looks down.
          
          On the floor, two droplets of blood appear between her bare
          feet...
          
          Now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her
          skirt. She is shaking more.
          
          She walks slowly out of the room, towards the kitchen.
          
                              APRIL (O.S.)
                    I think I need an ambulance....
                    Yes... One one five Revolutionary
                    Road.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - DAY.
          
          Milly folds laundry. She looks up to see -
          
          An ambulance turns into the Wheeler's driveway.   Her face
          clouds with instinctual foreboding.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep steps out into a hospital hallway.
          
          Frank paces, helpless in the waiting room, his face a mask of
          bewildered, childlike confusion. He looks up to see -
          
          Shep coming towards him.
          
                              SHEP
                    Frank? They tell you what
                    happened?
          
                                                                    99.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even
                    understand half the things he told
                    me. He said the fetus was out
                    before they got her here. He said
                    they had to operate to take out the
                    whatdycallit, the placenta and now
                    she's still bleeding. He said
                    she'd lost a lot of blood before
                    the ambulance came, and now they're
                    trying to stop it, and he said a
                    whole lot of things I didn't get,
                    about capillaries, and he said
                    she's unconscious. Jesus.
          
                              SHEP
                    How about sitting down, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    What the hell do I want to sit down
                    for!
          
                               SHEP
                    Okay.   Take it easy.
          
                               FRANK
                    My God.
          
                              SHEP
                    Here, have a cigarette.
          
          Shep offers the pack.   Frank doesn't take one.
          
                              FRANK
                    She did it to herself, Shep.
          
          Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    She did it to herself.
          
          Shep takes a cigarette for himself.   He lights it with
          trembling fingers.
          
                              SHEP
                    I'll get some coffee.
          
          Frank looks over at Shep as if he'd forgotten him.   He nods.
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
          Shep stands and walks down the hall.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - COFFEE MACHINE - AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. He looks
          up. He begins to feed coins into the machine. His hands are
          trembling. He drops a coin. It rolls under the machine. He
          has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it...
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping
          coffee onto the floor...
          
          He rounds the corner and stops.
          
          Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long
          echoing hallway. Shep looks around...
          
          Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number
          of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by
          two Doctors.
          
          Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair.    He's
          in shock.
          
                                FRANK
                    No.   No.   No.
          
          They try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his
          feet, the chair skidding behind him.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sit down Frank.
          
          Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank.
          
          
          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR.
          
          A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The
          crisp green lawns. The blue televisions flickering behind
          the glass.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
          We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the
          rush of a man's breath...
          
          Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears
          streaming silently down his face...
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING, ONE YEAR LATER.
          
          Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice.
          
          Shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks.
          
          MR. and MRS. BRACE, a pleasant looking young couple fresh
          from the city sit on the couch.
          
                                 MILLY
                       ...It was the worst experience of
                       my life. Such wonderful people.
                       Weren't they Shep? Poor April.
          
          Shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room.
          He stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring
          himself to sit down and join in.
          
                                 MILLY (CONT'D)
                       Frank lives in the city now.       Where
                       is it he works?
          
                                 SHEP
                       Bart Pollock Associates.
          
                                    MR. BRACE
                       Computers.     Interesting firm.
          
          Mr. Brace removes his pipe and looks at it.
          
                                 MRS. BRACE
                       Have you seen him since?
          
                                 MILLY
                       No. Too many memories, I think.
                       Shep's seen him. In the city.
          
          Shep nods.
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
                              MILLY (CONT'D)
                    He's just dedicated to those kids.
                    Every spare moment he has, he
                    spends with them...
          
          Shep turns and walks out of the room.
          
          
          EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING.
          
          Shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. He
          looks out over the suburban houses. At what was once the
          Wheeler house.
          
          Shep's face, looking out. His eyes are filled with tears.
          Milly comes up behind him.
          
                                MILLY
                    You okay?
          
                                SHEP
                    Mm-hmm.
          
          She takes his arm and holds him close.
          
                              SHEP (CONT'D)
                    I don't want to talk about The
                    Wheelers any more.
          
                             MILLY
                    Okay. We don't have to.     We don't
                    have to.
          
          Shep and Milly look out over Revolutionary Road.
          
          
          EXT. CITY PARK - DAY.
          
          The same silence over a beautiful day in the city.    And
          from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy
          branches of trees.
          
          Two children play in a playground in a small park.
          
          It's Jennifer and Michael.    They seem happy, engrossed. Other
          kids play around them.
          
                                                                  103.
          
          
          Watching them from a bench is Frank.   He is a little older, a
          little thinner.
          
          Close on Frank's face.   The SOUND of his children playing.
          
          
          INT. GIVINGS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Mrs. Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish
          onto a chair. Mr. Givings sits reading the paper.
          
          A new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I can't tell you how pleased I am
                    about the little Revolutionary Road
                    place, Howard. Remember how dreary
                    it looked all winter? All cold and
                    dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy-
                    crawly. And now whenever I drive
                    past, it gives me such a lift to
                    see it all perked up and spanking
                    clean again, with lights in the
                    windows. And do you know, I was
                    just thinking, I've loved that
                    little house for years, and the
                    Braces are the first really
                    suitable people I've ever found for
                    it. Really nice, congenial people,
                    I mean.
          
          Mr. Givings fiddles with his hearing aid.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Well, except for the Wheelers, you
                    mean.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers
                    but they always were a bit -- a bit
                    whimsical, for my taste. A bit
                    neurotic. I may not have stressed
                    it, but they were often very trying
                    people to deal with, in many ways.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 104.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    Actually, the main reason the
                    little house has been so hard to
                    sell is that they let it depreciate
                    so dreadfully. Warped window
                    frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on
                    the walls, filthy smudges around
                    all the--
          
          Mr. Givings reaches up to his ear and SUDDENLY... SILENCE...
          but for the faint sound of wind.
          
          He gazes out the window as behind him Mrs. Givings continues

          He has turned off his hearing aid.

          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.

          EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY

          She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

          SHOOTING STAR.
          Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

          EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

          A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

          EXT. CANOPY - DAY

          Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

          FROM HIS MOUNT.
          Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

          A SHOT RINGS OUT.

          BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE

          AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.

          FADE TO WHITE
          TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.
          FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
          red hair under a sterile cap.

          Franklin reaches for us, smiles...

                         FRANKLIN
          Here we go, Bright eyes.
          A MIST fogs our view for a moment.

                         CAROLINE
          Not too much. She needs to be
          calm, but alert.

          VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
          Go ahead - send her through.
          A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a
          tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.
          Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.
          Bright Eyes.

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and
          jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified
          chimpanzee slide into the machine.
          The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.

                         WILL
          Start the scan.
          A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         TECHIE
          Scanning.

          INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY

          Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the
           machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner.
          Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's
          full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.

                         DONNIE
          Stuff looks like Kool-aid.

                         CAROLINE
          Go ahead, I'm sure you could use
          it.

                         (OPENING VALVE)
          Starting the therapy...

          INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

          Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
          The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other
          room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR

          RESTRAINTS.

                         FRANKLIN
          She's convulsing.
          Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright
          Eyes' heart.

                         WILL

                         (INTO INTERCOM)
          Please keep the monkey still.
          He focuses back on the monitor.

                         CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
          She's not a monkey.
          Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
          intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
          his gaze.

          CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
          She's an ape. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas and orangutans, they're
          all apes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         WILL
          Good to know. Just keep it from
          moving.
          She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk
          sometimes.
          He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
          right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...

                         TECHIE
          Here we go.
          Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to
          succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.

          CHEER FROM THE GROUP.
          Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
          across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
          the others.

                         WILL
          We're on our way.

                         (BEAT)
          Good work.

          INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY


                         CAROLINE
          What is this?
          Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
          sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
          colorful symbols.
          Bright Eyes presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Tree.

          SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."
          Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          And this?
          The chimp presses another button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CAROLINE
          Where does the acorn come from?
          Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE
          Yes, but where does the acorn come
          from?

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn.

                         CAROLINE

                         NO -
          Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.

                         ELECTRONIC VOICE
          Acorn. Tree. Acorn.
          The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
          the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses
          another button.

          ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.
          The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
          like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE
          Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks
          out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS
          sitting on the desk in front of him.

                         CAROLINE
          We started the therapy four weeks
          ago. This was yesterday.
          Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          There's been clear cell growth.
          Both on the frontal lobe and the
          neocortex.
          She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
          He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
          and he's regretting that - gets in the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         WILL
          I see that. But I don't understand
          the primate behavioral norms. She
          knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
          any monkey know that?

                         CAROLINE
          No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
          us a tree, which gives us an acorn.

                         WILL
          Abstract thought...

                         CAROLINE
          In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
          Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
          moves away from him. He barely notices her now.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          You're calling her a monkey just to
          piss me off, aren't you?

                         WILL
          Start the other's on the 112.

                         (BEAT)
          And double this one's dose.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSK

          Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
          to show. Abstract thought!
          He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner
          of an old military base.

          EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)

           Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in front of his house.
          Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
          home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
          As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER

          AND OVER ON A PIANO.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
          stabbing at the key with his finger.
          Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
          emotional weight of this man, his father.

                         WILL
          Hey Dad.
          Walter looks up, whispers...

                         WALTER
          John... is that you?

                         WILL
          It's me. Will.

                         WALTER
          As thou dost, Anthony.
          (staring at the keys)
          .he hears no music. No music...

                         VOICE
          (heavy Russian accent)
          He's been doing that all day.
          A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.

                         IRENA
          He found an old book of his.
          She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
          pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.

                         IRENA (CONT'D)
          (shrugging on coat)
          I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
          so much, Mr. Walter.

                         WILL
          My mother was the one. She liked
          Shakespeare...

                         IRENA

                         (KISSES HIM)
          Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
          She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.

                         I WILL
          Come on, Dad.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Will helps his father change into pajamas.

                         WILL
          Remember I told you we were using
          Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
          the apes? Well the therapy seems
          to be working. We've seen definite
          signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
           Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Board of Directors is coming in a
           couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
          that's clinical trials.
          Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
          understanding what Will's saying.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Human trials, Dad. Soon.

                         WALTER
          I rather tell that what is to be
          feared than what I fear: for
          always... I am Caesar...
          There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..

                         WILL
          I'm going to make you better - I
          swear it.
          His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?

                         WALTER
          John... ?

                         WILL

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          No, Dad, it's me. Will.
          Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          John's gone.
           He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
          walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
          at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

          It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
          beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
          He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY

          Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.

                         FRANKLIN
          Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
          Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
          don't like my cooking?

          SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
          He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
          cage.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          You okay back there?

                         CAROLINE
          Something wrong with Bright Eyes?

                         FRANKLIN
          I'll check on her when we're done.
          Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
          next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
          Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
          cranium.
          From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
          door as Lucky's strapped down.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME

          Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
          brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
          steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.

                         JACOBS
          You could at least try to look
          excited.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
          disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.

                         WILL
          I'm not good with this stuff.
          Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.

                         JACOBS
          You'll do fine. Just speak
          English. Keep the science simple.

          INT. LAB - SAME

          From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
          open door as the ape on the table convulses.

                         CAROLINE
          Okay. Back it out...

                         DONNIE
          Your turn.
          Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO

          DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.

                          DONNIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon - Let go -
          She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S

          WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
           Hey! Something's wrong with number
          four!
          Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
          table...

                         FRANKLIN
          Be right over -
          Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
          different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?

                         DONNIE
          What's the matter with you?

          INT. BOARDROOM - SAME

          Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
          behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,
          he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.

          INT. LAB - SAME

          Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries
          to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
          Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS

          HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.

                         DONNIE
          Hey!!!
          Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
          apes begin to SCREECH.
          Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.

                         DONNIE (CONT'D)
          Someone get her off of me!

                         CAROLINE
          Hang on -
          Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
          over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

           Will continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
          board members - they're lost.

                         WILL
          In the past, it's been impossible
          to target specific areas, both
          because of the Blood Brain Barrier -
          Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.

                         JACOBS
          What Dr. Rodman has done is to
          invent a virus that can, for the
          first time, cross the membrane that
          protects the brain and deliver a
          genetic, therapeutic, payload.

                         WILL
          (trying to sell)
          This 'payload' would directly
          affect the areas of memory, higher
          function - and, of course, the
          motherlode: intelligence.
          The board members stare, trying to comprehend.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          Meaning?

                         WILL
          Meaning.
          (deep breath here)
          If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're
           looking at a cure for Alzheimer's.
           With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
           from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
          effect.

          INT. LAB - DAY


                          DONNIE
          She's breaking my hand!

                         CAROLINE
          Let go, Bright Eyes! You're
          hurting him!
          She tries to help pull Donnie away.

                         CAROLINE (CONT'D)
          Let go!
          In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.

          LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND

          THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.

          HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.

                         FRANKLIN
          Lucky no! Stop!

                         (TO CAROLINE)
          Hit the alarm!
          Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.

          DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

          INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

          LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
          of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
          scampers - unattended - down the hall.

                         GUARD #1
          Uh oh.
          Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN

          SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO

          GET HIM FREE.

                         GUARD #2
          Hey, Len...?
          Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
          Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY

          Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
          grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest
          building.

          INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

          The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's
          pronouncement.

                         BOARD MEMBER
          What about the safety of the virus?

                         WILL
           Perfectly safe. We're using the
          most stable -
          A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
          Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and
          pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.
          The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY

          INCISORS...
          â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.
          The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -
          collapses on the boardroom table.

          EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS
          and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.
          Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
          and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline
          walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder
          packed in ice.
          He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.

                         WILL
          Are they gone?

                         JACOBS
          Long gone.
          Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.

                         WILL
          Did they say anything before they
          left? I mean, about Phase 2.

                         JACOBS
          Look around you, for Christ sakes.
          We'll be lucky if we don't go to
          jail.
          Will's gutted - devastated.

                         WILL
          But we're so close.

                         JACOBS
          You think you're the only one who's
          got something at stake here? I've
          got my own skin in this game!

                         WILL
          What happened had nothing to do
          with the 112.
          (desperate to clarify)
          Take an already aggressive animal,
          make it smarter - you're going to
          get a potentially dangerous

                         SITUATION -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         JACOBS
          What makes you so damned positive
          about that?
          (pauses for emphasis)
          What if this drug does things you
          don't understand? Are you going to
          take responsibility for that?
          Because I'm sure as hell not going
          to.
          Here Will hesitates.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          We're not ready for human trials.
          Hell, we weren't ready for monkey
          trials.

                         WILL
          They're apes.

                         JACOBS
          This is what we're going to do:
          You're taking a sabbatical. I'll
          let the board handle the lawsuit.
          When this blows over I'll bring you
          back and we'll start over - we'll
          do it right this time. With mice.
          Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.
          Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.

          INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN
          HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV

          112.
          His work - destroyed.

          EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT

          Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a
          jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE

          USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.
          TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.
          Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the
          window.

                         Â¢ FRANKLIN
          Show you something, boss?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         WILL
          I don't work here anymore,
          Franklin.

                         FRANKLIN
          I just put down fifteen animals,
          Dr. Rodman. The least you could do
          is give me a moment of your time.
          Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
          devastating day.

                         WILL
          of course.

          INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT

          The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used
          SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the
          floor.
          It's a creepy, horrible scene.

                         FRANKLIN
          They're all gone.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely
          sorry...
          What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
          Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
          moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.
          At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The
          lighting's dim and the thing's so small...
          But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT

          CHIMPANZEE.
          Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It's impossible. How could a full-
          term gestation go unnoticed?

                         FRANKLIN
          They carry small. Must have been
          pregnant when they brought her in.
          Will tries to get his mind around the situation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         WILL
          Who else knows about this?

                         FRANKLIN
          No one.

                         (BEAT)
          I'd bring him home, but my brother-
          in-law works for security. He'd
          rat me out in a second.
          That's when will realizes.

                         WILL
          You want me to take him?

                         FRANKLIN
          He's an orphan now.

                         WILL
          I could be thrown in jail. He's a
          chimpanzee who's been exposed to a
          possibly dangerous drug.

                         FRANKLIN
          You don't believe that.

                         WILL
          Doesn't matter what I believe.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just for a couple days. Until I
          can find a sanctuary.

                         WILL
          That's not possible.

                         FRANKLIN
          I heard you outside, fighting to
          keep them alive.

                         WILL
          I was talking about the work, my

                         RESEARCH -

                         FRANKLIN
          she was just trying to protect him.

                         WILL
          What?

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         FRANKLIN
          Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
          why she wouldn't let anyone into
          her cage.
          Will looks down at the helpless baby.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
          but there's nothing I can do here.
          He's got to be put down like the
          others.

                         FRANKLIN
          Tell you what, Doc.
          (producing a syringe)
          I'm done for the day. So you be my
          guest.
          Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
          It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
          enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
          little hands.
          Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
          belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
          Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
          watches from outside the cage.

                         WILL
          Two days. Then you have to figure
          it out.

          INT. WALMART - NIGHT

          A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
          cart.
          Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
          in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
          He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
          of choices.

          INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT

          A TEEN rings up the baby goods.

                         TEEN CASHIER
          Hey man. Congratulations.

                         WILL
          Huh?

                         (REALIZING)
          Oh. Thanks.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in his truck.

          EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
          chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
          the door.

                         IRENA
          It's Friday night. I had a date.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry - there was -
          She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
          walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
           He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
          refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
          He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
          contents in the sink.
          Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE

          VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND

          ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
          WAIL comes from another part of the house.
          Will sits up, remembering.

          INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

          Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
          lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
          making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.

          20.
          Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
          what to do.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
          limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
          and sits.

                         WILL
          It's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
          Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
          room fills with STEAM.

                         CUT TO:
          A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
          a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
          In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
          FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT

          TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
          Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
          intimidates all the chimps around him.

          REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING

          THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
          Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
          in his arms.

          SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"
          SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
          bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
          THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
          The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
          The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
          and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
          As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
          LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...

          â¢INT. ATTIC -- DAY

          .the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
          TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
          walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
          SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
          The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER

          HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...

          EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY

          From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
          neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
          his lawn.
          There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
          up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
          HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
          WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
          his carry-on suitcase.
          Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
          Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
          brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
          bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
          The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
          TEARS and runs after them.

          WILL (O.S.)
          Caesar! Breakfast!
          The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
          The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
          of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
          for the box, reads the side...
          AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
          Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
          picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
          Will walks over, sits across from him.

          Thanks.

          You're welcome.
          NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there
          will be subtitles.

          INT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY

           A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
          progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.
          The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
          reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
          studies the cone.

                         LAB TECH
          Is he going to turn left or
          right...?
          The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
          piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement
          blooming on his face.

                         WILL
          There it is. Restored cognitive
          function.

                         LAB TECH
          Same success rate as the primates.
          Congratulations.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

           VISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls
           around to an Employee Parking Lot.

           INT. PRIMATE INFIRMARY, SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes
           taking Caesar's blood pressure.

          He's right on target. Height.
          Weight...
          She checks Caesar's ears.

                         CAESAR
          Dairy Queen.

                         WILL
          After. Sit still.

                         STEWART
          What about diet?

                         WILL
          A healthy diet. Fruits,
          vegetables.

                         CAESAR
          Ice cream.
          Will ignores him.

                         STEWART
          What's he saying?

                         WILL
          He's hungry.
          Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
          sends him a look - out it out.

                         STEWART
          He seems extremely intelligent.
          How many words does Caesar sign?
          Beat.

                         WILL
          You know, the basics.

                         CAESAR
          Soft-serve.

                         STEWART
          I've heard of apes learning up to a
          hundred and fifty words. Is he
          good with puzzles?
          Will hesitates.

          He's pretty good.

          Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously
          happy. You're doing a great job
          with him.
          (doesn't want to alarm)
          But there is an anomaly I noticed.

                         WILL
          Like what?

                         STEWART
          When I was examining his eyes, I
          noticed a strange green
          pigmentation.

                         WILL
          Green?
          His heart starts to pound.

                         STEWART
          Green. Never.seen it before.
          She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Take a look.
          Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds

          FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          It's faint, can you pick it up?
          He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You alright? Want a glass of
          water?

                         WILL
          No thanks.

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Sure, that would be good.
          She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Forgot to eat today. Not a big
          deal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (TO CAESAR)
          I'm fine.
          Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.

                         STEWART
          Carotid pulse is running a little
          fast.

                         WILL
          For a human or a chimpanzee?
          First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.

                         STEWART
          Gotta remember to eat.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream
          cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"

          EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.

          WILL (O.S.)
          You have to move the whole tower to
          another peg, one block at a time.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
          Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
          wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
          first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.
          Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a
          CAMCORDER on a tripod.

                         WILL
          Here's the hard part: you can't put
          a larger block on top of a smaller
          one.
          Caesar studies the puzzle.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Understand?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.
          Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving
          blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,
          getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...
          Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower
          on a different pole. It's easy for him.
          Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
          pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (STUNNED)
          He did it in fifteen moves.

                         IRENA
          What's the best score?

                         WILL
          Fifteen.
          Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.

                         IRENA

                         (AMAZED)
          I wonder where he gets such talent?

                         WILL
          (eyes on Walter)
          It was passed down from his mother.

          Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
          prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          At age two Caesar appears to exceed
          his mother's aptitude. He signs
          over three hundred words. He
          exhibits no visible side effects
          from the therapy...

          INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
           Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
           REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.
           Inside-WE SEE: THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
          hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
          Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
          LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
          Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the
          brightness.

                         WILL
          (syringe in hand)
          Dad. I've got something that's
          going to make you better.
          Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC
          SQUEAKING NOISE as we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE

          NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.

          SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
          Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
          "little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
          Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
          At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
          neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD

          PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
          At the height of his backward motion he catches another
          glimpse.
          Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the
          window.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Ham!

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
          begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
          to watch his father.
          The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
          Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
          There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
          undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
          side. CLICK.
          Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
          clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
          to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
          The color drains from his face.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

           Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
          next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
          stopped playing to stare at him.
          Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
          tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
          back to Caesar.

                         TODD'S BUDDY
          Check it. He wants to play.
          Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
          Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
          Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
          brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         TODD
          Monkey in the middle.
          Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
          sure what's funny.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!

                         WILL
          He won't go far.

                         WALTER
          You don't know that.

                         WILL
          I do, Dad.

          INT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
          Caesar jumps to try and catch it.

          TODD AND FRIEND
          Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
          middle...
          Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
          away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE

          FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.

          THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S

          GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
          They're making fun of him.
          "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
          Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
          stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
          Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
          Alice runs inside.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:
          â¢ HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

          Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified
          chimp backs toward his fence.

                         HUNSIKER
          Hah! Hah -
          Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
          AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.

                         WILL
          Hold on - it's okay - he's
          harmless!

                         HUNSIKER
          Your monkey came onto my property!
          Threatened my kids!
          By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
          in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.

                         WILL
          It won't happen again...

                         HUNSIKER
          Damn right it won't happen again!
          I'll press charges if it does!
          Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY


                         STEWART
          What does he do for fun?
          Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
          thrown by the question.

                         WILL
          Well we've got puzzles, games, a
          swing set...

                         STEWART
          My guess is he needs more. More
          exercise, more space.

                         WILL
          We'll work on that.
          Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
          to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          He gets up his nerve.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          What about you?

                         (BEAT)
          What do you do for fun?
          She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
          understand the question.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          How about dinner and a movie?
          Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

                         STEWART
          I'm sorry, did you say something?
          He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.

                         WILL
          No - nothing.
          Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
          Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
          but Will doesn't say more.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY

          From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
          link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
          extremely excited.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY

          As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
          place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
          tugging at the leash.

                         WALTER
          Take him off the leash.

                         Â¢ WILL
          There's a place up ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY

          They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
          kneels next to Caesar.

                         WILL
          Don't go far. Stay where I can see
          you.
          Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
          flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
          gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
          The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
          another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A

          GROVE OF TREES.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING)
          Remember - stay where I can see you
          - if you got lost in these woods
          I'd never find you.

          BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE

          SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM

          A CANOPY OVERHEAD.

                         WALTER
          Go ahead. Climb!
          The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
          branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
          obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
          Walter become smaller and smaller down below.

          SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
          RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
          grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
          At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE

          LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP

          EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.

          HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP

          GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
          Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
          the mountains. Then down to Will below.
          Will's pointing to his watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          â¢ CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands
          beside him on the forest floor.
          Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
          much taller now - over five feet.

                         WILL
          Sorry to rush you - got to get home
          and check on Walter.
          They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
          DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
          struggles to control him.

                         WOMAN

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Is that a chimpanzee?

                         WILL
          Don't worry - he's harmless. Very
          sweet.
          The big dog keeps BARKING.
          Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,

          CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
          The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
          the Woman away.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Guess he had it coming.
          Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE

          LINGERING ON THE LEASH.
           THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -
          machinery everywhere.

          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY

          Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds
          himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.

                         WILL
          Where's Dr. Stewart?

                         S VETERINARIAN
          She doesn't work here anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Doesn't work here anymore?

                         WILL
          Do you know where she went?

                         VETERINARIAN
          I'm sorry - I don't.
          Will's deeply disappointed.

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
          Caesar's transfixed.
          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
          Neither makes a sound.

                         WILL
          Come on.
          As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb
          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

          SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
          walk home from school.
          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
          smiles, flirts back.
          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
          these teens. He wants to be one of them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
          He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
          posture, their gait.

          BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A

          CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.

          THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST

          LIKE ALPHA'S.
           He runs two fingers down the length of it.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
          tension here, but we can't place it yet.
          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
          USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
          staring at it.

                         WILL
          Turn it around, Dad. You're using
          the wrong end.
          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
          With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the
          old man, adjusting the spoon.
          Will watches. Heartbroken.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,
          leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one
          orange. The mouse hesitates, confused.
          He backs away from the cone.
          A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,
          reading the number results on a monitor.
          Will's obviously discouraged.

                         WILL
          The drug's not staying ahead of the
          disease.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         JACOBS
          But we're still making progress,
          right?
          Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written
          all over his face.

                         WILL
          Sure. At this pace we'll get to
          trials by the time Hell freezes
          over.
          Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.

                         JACOBS
          This isn't graduate school -
          there's a procedure we have to
          adhere to.

                         WILL
          It'll take forever. I need to
          start developing a primate version
          now.
          Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.

                         JACOBS
          How's your father? Haven't seen
          him in a while.

                         WILL
          This isn't about him.

                         JACOBS
          He's worse, isn't he?
          Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell
          him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.

                         WILL

                         (EVASIVE)
          He's fine.

          WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.
          It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the
          following...

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed
          with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         WILL
          (into computer mic)
          Caesar continues to maintain a high
          level of cognition. But Walter's
          disease has caught up to the
          neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all
          initial improvement has been
          erased...
          Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.
          Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will
          senses his presence. Looks up.

                         CAESAR
          Who Caesar.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         CAESAR
          Who.
          With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and
          tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Who.

                         WILL
          Caesar is an ape.

                         (SIGNING)
          A chimpanzee.

                         CAESAR
          No "what". "Who".
          Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual
          leap Caesar's taken.

                         WILL
          Are you asking about your identity?
          That's abstract thought, Caesar.
          Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CAESAR
          Walter Will father. Will Caesar
          father?
          Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his
          face. How to begin to answer?

          WILL (O.S.)
          This is where you were born. It's
          the place where I work.

          INT. MOVING CAR/PARKED CAR - DAY

          Will and Caesar are PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GEN-SYS
          LAB GROUNDS, its buildings visible through the fencing.

                         WILL
          I never knew your father, but your
          mother came to live here. This is
          where you were born.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother?

                         WILL
          She was very very smart. And she
          passed that onto you through her
          blood.
          Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar go. Caesar see.
          Will locks the car door.

                         WILL
          She's not here anymore. I'm sorry,
          Caesar - she died. That's when I
          brought you home to live with me
          and Walter.
          Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.

                         CAESAR
          Caesar mother...
          Will grows concerned.

                         WILL
          No. This is a bad place for you,
          Caesar. We're going to go now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,
          twisting around to look out the back window.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Let's see if we can find something
          for you on the TV...

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older
          woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images
          as she changes channels.
          The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a
          SPACE LAUNCH. ASTRONAUTS wave to the PRESS CORPS as they
          board a SHUTTLE.

                         TV REPORTER
          The Icarus crew is led by Commander
          Colonel George Taylor. This is his
          fifth space mission...

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          CLOSE ON a crude drawing of an ape. Caesar sits on the
          floor, working on its details. As he draws the white
          birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-
          portrait.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck
          chair.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.
          REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.
          As if he's not sure where he is.
          Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE

          FRONT DOOR.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street
          ahead of him is quiet. No one around.
          Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the
          sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of
          SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The
          car SMASHES into a nearby tree.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
          vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
          Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
          then turns to YELL at someone.
          That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
          He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
          rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
          In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
          menacing finger.

                         HUNSIKER
          Look at the front of my car you
          stupid, stupid old man! You should
          be locked up! Your son's going to
          pay for that damage -

          CAESAR EXPLODES OUT THE DOOR.
          No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS
          HUNSIKER to the ground.

                         WALTER
          Caesar...
          Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
          fists.

                         HUNSIKER
          Help! Get him off -

                         WALTER
          Caesar... no... Stop!
          Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.
          But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
          man off his back.
          Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE

          "JABBING" POINTER FINGER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         HUNSIKER
          Aaaaaaaah!
          Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE

          OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.

                         WALTER
          Caesar!
          Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
          over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Please stop.
          Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and
          sprints for his house.

          CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S

          TOO BIG TO FIGHT.
          He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS
          HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.

          EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY

          Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
          flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
          block Hunsiker's entrance.
          White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
          his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -
          Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.
          He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
          over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
          Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
          escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR

          HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
          Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
          Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE

          LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
          Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree
          branch and swings from tree to tree.
          with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
          the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
          Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
          of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
          Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.

                         HUNSIKER
          Please no...
          Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.
          But then he sees something across the street that abruptly
          pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -

          BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.
          He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.
          All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          Will's car drives down a two-lane highway.

          REPORTER (V.0.)
          .chimpanzee named Caesar,
          terrorizing the quiet family
          enclave and mauling neighbor
          Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for
          Global Airlines.

          INT. JACOBS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Jacobs watches the evening NEWS.

                         REPORTER
          The defense claimed the chimp was
          merely trying to protect its owner
          from perceived aggression.
          FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews.
          Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          The chimpanzee's distraught owner,
          Wilson Rodman, has raised the
          animal since he was an infant.

          43.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          He pleaded to keep Caesar at home,
          citing the ape's remarkable
          intelligence.
          Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.

          INT. MOVING CAR Â»- DAY

          Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and
          a Polo shirt.

                         WILL
          We're visiting a place called "The
          Ranch". They have animals.

                         CAESAR
          Real animals?

                         WILL
          You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas, orangutans...
          Caesar GRUNTS, excited.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It'll be good. You'll like it very
          much.
          Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.

                         CAESAR
          Will sad?

                         WILL
          What? No, I'm fine.

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the
          window.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE
          AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic
          countryside.
          A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
          cold, efficient structures.

                         CAESAR
          Where animals?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT

          RED METAL ATRIUM.

                         WILL
          Inside, I think...

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from
          the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.

                         WILL
          You must be Mr. Landon.

                         (SHAKING HANDS)
          This is Caesar.

          MR. LANDON
          Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is
          Dodge, helps me run the place.

                         WILL
          I've been telling Caesar about the
          animals you have here. How much
          fun it is.

          MR. LANDON
          Yes, we have a big play center
          where the chimpanzees like to
          climb.

                         (TO CAESAR)
          Want to see the play center?
          Caesar nods. Absolutely.

          EXT. CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are
          climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a
          LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.
          A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for
          now... it's empty. No apes in sight.
          Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.

          MR. LANDON
          What do you think, Caesar? Want to
          give it a try?
          Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
          harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         WILL
          Go ahead.
          He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-

          LIKE SLIDING DOOR.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings
          from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.

          EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,

          LOCKING IT.
          He braces himself.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
          TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the
          bars, but HE'S REACHED...

          A DEAD END.
          CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
          gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.

          HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.

          HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
          Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
          Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
          UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
          The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
          the gate, tries to shake it open.

                         WILL
          It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
          be okay...
          The words are for him as much as Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You're going to live here for a
          while. This is what the Judge says
          we have to do.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He
          frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
          The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
          apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
          bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          They'll take good care of you here.

                         DODGE
          That's about it for visiting hours.
          Will shoots him a look of daggers.

          MR. LANDON
          What Dodge means is, in our
          experience, longer you drag out the
          leave-taking, harder it is. On
          both of you.
          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry to trick you this way,
          but you would never have agreed. I
          was afraid they'd hurt you if they
          forced you -

          MR. LANDON
          He'll be fine.
          Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is
          matched only by Caesar's.
          WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
          Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a

          CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.

          CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.

                         DODGE
          Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.
          Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          This way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
          through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.
          Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.
          He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.
          This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor
          area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND

          THEIR CAGES.

                         DODGE
          Caesar - over here.
          Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
          salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE

          REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.
          He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.

          CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Stupid monkey.

          FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS

          THE BETRAYAL.
          Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to
          the ceiling, searching for a way out.
          To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES
          pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:

          THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW
          THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...

          EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          .and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,
          away from the Ranch.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          Will keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER

          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD

          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
          This is ROCKET.
          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
          challenging eye to Caesar.

          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
          A terrifying display of power and dominance.

          DODGE (O.S.)
          Okay, assholes. Dinner time.
          Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening
          look to Caesar - moves off.
          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
          Bet you don't get none of that in
          the suburbs.
          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Think that's funny? That funny to
          you, you hairy prick?
          Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.

                         RODNEY
          Look at that!
          Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.

                         DODGE
          One thing you can count on: Long as
          there are humans on this earth,
          you'll always be a monkey in a
          cage.
          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
          floor.

                         RODNEY
          What about his clothes? Might
          cause problems with the other apes.

                         DODGE
          Leave 'em.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's
          swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.
           The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY

          Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on
          the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,
          etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.

           WALTER (O.S.)
           John?
           Walter enters, looks at Will.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          John - where's Caesar?
          The old man looks stricken.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't
          there something we can do?
          Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea.

          INT. LAB CAFETERIA - DAY

          WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.
          He's shaved, pulled himself together.
          Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
          He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.
          Will slides into the seat across from him.

                         JACOBS
          You've been gone a week.

                         WILL
          I was sick.

                         JACOBS
          Too sick to return my calls? You
          know it was a funny thing, but I
          was watching the news and they
          started talking about a seven-year-
          old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
          all of a sudden, there you were on
          the TV. A seven year old chimp,
          raised since birth.
          The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
          voice. Neither man cares.

                         WILL
          He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
          smart. Off-the-charts smart.
          Because of the 112. The genetic
          therapy was passed in utero - from
          the mother to the son. Without a
          single negative side-effect.

                         JACOBS
          Aside from biting off a man's
          finger.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         WILL
          He was protecting my father. The
          same way his mother was protecting
          him.

                         JACOBS
          We've had this conversation
          already. We knew the 112 was
          making the apes smart -

                         WILL

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          I tried the 112 on my father.
          A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
          effect Will was after.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I had a sample vial.

                         JACOBS
          You're out of your mind.
          Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
          there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.

                         WILL
          Don't you want to know if it
          worked?
          Jacobs can't resist...

                         JACOBS
          Did it?

                         WILL
          It was miraculous. Unquestionable
          adult neurogenesis - development of
          fresh nerve tissue.

                         (BEAT)
          It brought my father back.
          But Jacobs is confused.

                         JACOBS
          You told me he was failing.

                         WILL
          It's just like with the mice.
          Alzheimer's is a progressive
          disease, you need to keep it at bay
          â¢ - you need boosters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the
          possibilities. The money.

                         JACOBS
          Why have you waited so long to tell
          me this?

                         WILL
          I couldn't risk losing him.

                         JACOBS
          'Him'?

                         WILL
          Caesar.

                         JACOBS
          The ape?
          Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.

                         WILL
          We've discovered a safe treatment.
          It's the payday you've been waiting
          for. I'll recreate the primate
          version of 112 for you.

                         (BEAT)
          But only under one condition.
          It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.

                         JACOBS
          You're giving me conditions? I
          could have you arrested for what
          you've done.

                         WILL
          But you won't - you need me to
          build the drug. Here's what I
          need: I want you to get Caesar
          back.

                         JACOBS

                         (THROWN)
          How the hell can I do that?

                         WILL
          However they do things in your part
          of the world. Get attorneys into
          it. Write checks. Slip cash into
          the right pockets.
          (pausing for emphasis)
          Make it happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING

          Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING

          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING

           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

                         BRIDGE:
          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

          LIKE A HUMAN.

          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

          EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE

          MORE UPRIGHT...
          Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET

          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF

          CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.
          Out cold.

          INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY

          Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
          His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
          now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
          restrained to a medical table.
          Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

                         VOICE
          Caesar.
          Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.

                         STEWART
          Do you remember me? I'm Dr.
          Stewart.
          She hands him a cup of water with a straw.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Drink.
          Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly
          doesn't understand. He signs again.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I don't understand.
          Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
          SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?

                         STEWART (CONT-D)
          Can you show me? Show me what you
          need.
          Caesar pulls at the restraints.

                          STEWART (CONT'D)
           I can't take those off.
           Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry this has happened,
          Caesar. So sorry.
          Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his
          emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm here once a week. I'll do my
          best to look after you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

          Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking
          them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and--
          Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair.

          STEWART (O.S.)
          What were you thinking?

                         DODGE
          oh, hey Doc.

                         STEWART
          That chimp needs protection.
          Dodge's face falls.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          You could've gotten him killed.

                         DODGE

                         (A LIE)
          I told Rodney not to open his cage.

                         STEWART
          Can't you see how sensitive he is?
          How intelligent?

                         DODGE
          Yeah, no, he's a real smart
          dresser.

                         STEWART
          I want him moved to the orangutan
          house. He'll be safe there until
          we re-introduce him to the group.

                         DODGE
          I'm sorry, since when do volunteer
          animal doctors make the rules
          around here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         STEWART
          Please. Just do it.

                         DODGE
          Whatever you say, doc.
          Dodge returns to stacking the chow.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          You're the one with the college
          education.

          INT. 'VIRUS FACTORY', GEN-SYS LABS - DAY

          A spinning machine, test tubes, a giant propagation tank.
          Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
          REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.
          A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him. He's tentative, nervous.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a
          mistake.
          Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
          took so long to come up.

          VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
          I've double-checked the replication
          rate of the 113 - and it's
          enormously fast compared to the

          112.

                         WILL
          That's why we're using it. We need
          the drug quickly.

                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN
          But... isn't it risky? I mean, at
          this rate of propagation, we
          greatly increase the possibility of
          mutations that are out of our
          control. It's a highly unstable -

                         WILL
          I appreciate your concern - but
          it's going to be fine. We plan on
          taking precautions.
          The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's
          look tells him the conversation is over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          BEEP BEEP BEEP...

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES -- DAY

           A large truck backs onto a loading dock. Will watches as a
           NEW GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES are unloaded from the truck and
          brought into the lab.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

           Will's in his sweats, working. DOORBELL.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Will opens the door to FIND STEWART STANDING THERE. For a
          moment he's too shocked to say anything.

                         STEWART
          Sorry to drop in on you like this.
          The clinic at the zoo gave me your
          address but they didn't have a
          phone number -

                         WILL

                         (RECOVERING)
          Don't worry about it. You want to
          come in?

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They stand awkwardly by the door. She looks great.

                          WILL
          Can I - you want a cup of coffee or
          something?

                         STEWART
          No - thanks. I just wanted to let
          you know that I've seen Caesar.
          Seen Caesar?

                         WILL
          How?

                         STEWART
          I volunteer once a week at The
          Ranch.

                         WILL
          Is he alright?
          She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         STEWART
          Yeah. He had a rough start, but
          things should get smoother from now
          on...
          In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will
          follows Stewart's curious gaze.

                         WILL
          That's my dad. He's not doing too
          well.

                         STEWART
          Oh. Sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay.
          I'm looking after him.

                         WILL
          Thank you... I appreciate that.
          Awkward beat.

                         STEWART
          Well. If you give me your number
          I'll let you know from time to time
          how things are going -

                         WILL
          Let's grab a drink.
          Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.
          She's happy he asked.

                         STEWART
          Love to.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Nighttime.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
          and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
          orangutans sleep.
          ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
          windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
          his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
          40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.

                         DODGE
          Want a beer?
          The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Here's a little taste of beer...
          He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.
          Caesar watches, disgusted.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING


          A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
          Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
          in succession.
          Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE

          ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.

                         DODGE & RODNEY
          Move it! Let's go!
          Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
          ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
          across the bridge.
          On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
          ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
          then moves off to join the others.
          Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
          Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
          push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
          arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

          HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
          Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
          Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
          alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
          Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
          Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

          CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
          contain his excitement.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
          on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
          appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
          clearly thrilled to see him.

                         WILL
          There you are! I heard what
          happened.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home now. Caesar home.
          He tugs Will away from Dodge.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get you out of here,
          but not today. I'm working on it.
          Caesar's face falls.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Soon. I promise.
          Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home.
          Still a question, a flicker of hope.

                         WILL
          (kills him to say it)
          Not yet. I can't yet.
          Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
          First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
           starts walking back to his cage.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Wait a second - Caesar, where are
          you going?
          â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
          Dodge catches up with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         DODGE
          (loud enough for Will)
          No place like home, huh monkey boy?

                         WILL
          Caesar - come back here!
          He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
          him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY

          Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

           .storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
          of the office... just as -
          BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
          ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
          might've just broken his hand.

                         WILL
          You son of a bitch.
          Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.

                         DODGE
          That was not a smart thing to do.
          Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
          too angry to care.

                         WILL
          If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
          if he's mistreated in any way, I
          swear I'll have you brought up on
          charges.
          Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.

                         DODGE
          That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
          any more. He's mine now.
          The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          And you're on private property.
          Now get the hell out of here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         WILL
          Forget jail. I'll come back and
          kill you.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - LATER

          A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -
          watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the
          bag into the shed...

          STEWART (O.S.)
          Morning Caesar.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.

                         STEWART
          How's your arm? Mind if I take a
          look?
          Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
          PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Looking good...
          Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
          She pulls a harness from her bag.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
          cheer him up, show him the horses.

                         DODGE
          No way.
          As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.

                         STEWART
          What are you going to do? Use a
          cattle prod on me?

                         DODGE
          If you're into that kind of thing.

                         STEWART
          I'm safer with him than I am with
          you.

                         DODGE
          Answer's no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.

                         STEWART
          I can't take you.
          (glancing at Dodge)
          Maybe another time.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
          Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
          SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
          He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
          he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
          them and extending them end to end.
          Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
          shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
          They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
          Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
          Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.
          Caesar returns to crafting the tool.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Dark FORMS in cages, illuminated by GREEN FLUORESCENT LIGHT.
          The DOOR OPENS. EYES OPEN, HEADS TURN.
          Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.
          The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching
          the dark chimpanzee faces.

          EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST

          BAND.

                         WILL
          Which one of you wants chocolate...
          Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
          NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE

          ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.
          Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          "Koba."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL

          BENEATH A HEAVILY PROTRUDING BROW, DARKENED PIGMENTATION

          STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.
          He DROPS AN M&M INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets
          it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.
          Then he puts out his hand again.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Nanotherapy, beta version: Male
          Test Subject Number eleven.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.
          He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,
          opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
          pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
           Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're
          secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.
           All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes.
          Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen
          mask.
          Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the
          chimp's face.

                         EVANS

                         (THROUGH MASK)
          Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he?
          Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO

          KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.

          THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.

          INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will
          sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of
          dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.
          Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
          with the chopsticks.

                         STEWART
          You actually punched him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         WILL
          I did.
          She thinks it's funny.

                         STEWART
          I've been wanting to do that since
          the day I met him.

                         WILL
          I don't advise it. My hand's
          killing me.

                         STEWART
          Here. Let me help you out.
          She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his
          chopsticks.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get him out of there.

                         STEWART
          I know you are.

                         WILL
          And I'm going to get my dad back
          too.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a
          THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its
          end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.
          Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE

          CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.
          He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
          trying... until finally the loop's in place.
          Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.
          He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.
          Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM

          INTO THE NIGHT.

          EXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT

          Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to
          the chimpanzee house - and keeps going.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT

          He arrives at the Gorilla House.
          Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar
          unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.
          He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.
          Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...

          INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT

          .enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.
          From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest
          rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles
          his toe.
          There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
          finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
          Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
           Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
           doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,
          let's go."
           Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him...

          EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          .across the bridge...

          EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT

          .and into the atrium. Caesar follows.
          The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing
          structure.
          The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.
          Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the
          way across the atrium, then all the way back.
          Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.
          Caesar stands back, silently watching.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING

          A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine:
          0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          He makes his way to the ape houses.

          EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING

          Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer
          and closer to the cage... until they're right in front.
          The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate
          chow into the gorilla's trough.

          BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS

          HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING

          Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's
          beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN

          DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE: HE USES SIGN LANGUAGE.

                         MAURICE
          Happy gorilla.
          Caesar's shocked.

                         MAURICE (CONT'D)
          Surprise.

                         CAESAR
          Signing orangutan.

                         MAURICE
          Maurice circus orangutan.

                         CAESAR
          More ape sign?

                         MAURICE
          No. Maurice alone.
          They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.

                         CAESAR
          Careful. Stupid human no like
          smart ape.
          Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs.
          Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. Pieces of primate chow hit him in the head.
          He wakes with a start. SEES THAT HIS CAGE DOOR IS OPEN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON

          AREA.
          Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee
          common area - toward the door -
          Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S

          PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.

          ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.

          HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A

          MOUNTAIN: BUCK.
          Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;
          Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it
          SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.
          The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
          Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.

          STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE

          SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -

          OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.
          A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

          LOCKS HIM IN.
          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
          his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

          CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they
          administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.
          Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.
          They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies
          down, allows himself to be strapped in.
          All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
          But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA

          â¢ THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         WILL
          Hold him steady!
          Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.

          WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.
          Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the
          table.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You okay Evans?

                         EVANS
          Yeah. I'm good.

          INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

          Will demonstrates the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle. Koba watches.

                         WILL
          You can't put larger blocks on top
          of smaller ones.
          (pointing to right side)
          Move the stack from here to here.
          Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,

          SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
          Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          You've got to take the blocks off
          and stack them again, like this.
          Will turns the puzzle back around.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Let's see you try.
          Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I'll give you an M&M if you can get
          the blocks to the other side - but
          don't do it the way you did last
          time.
          Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME
          COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You know what I want. You're just
          not going to give it to me.
          Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,

          DISQUIETING.

          AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK

          SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...

          WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          What do you think of Koba?

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

           We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far
          away, across the room.

                          FRANKLIN
           You wanna know if I think the 113's
           making him nuts.

                         WILL
          I know he's smart. But there's
          something else, something
          worrisome. He challenges me.
          Taunts me.
          Will looks toward us, toward the bars.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (almost to himself)
          I don't want to try it on...

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          .I don't want to start human
          trials if there's any chance of
          danger.

                         FRANKLIN
          What you're seeing has nothing to
          do with the 113, Doc. The apes're
          just like us - they're complex.
          Some are loyal, some are selfish,
          some have a good sense of humor.
          And some are born rotten.
          Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of
          view, from inside the cage.
          Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his
          â¢ face frame the two men across the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
          This one's a bad apple, that's all.
          A chill runs down Will's spine.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY

          A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill.

                         GUARD

                         (OPENING GATE)
          Early day today, Evans?

                         EVANS
          Actually I'm not feeling too good.

          EVANS GETS A SHIVER.

                         GUARD
          You know what: Whiskey, lemon,
          honey and a cup of hot water.
          Never fails.

                         EVANS
          Thanks - I'm on it.
          Evans drives off.

          EXT. PADDOCK - DAY

          Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at
          the chimpanzee area.
          She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves
          easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the
          others make way for him.
          Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar
          so at ease with the other apes.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the
          bars.

                         RODNEY
          Still won't eat, won't come out.

                         DODGE
          I can fix that.
          Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get that monkey ass out of there!

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't
          struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

          Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
          Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
          seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
          a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
          At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
          Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
          cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT

          Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...
          But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.
          No shovel.
          He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
          Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,

          OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
          CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
          Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
          makes a motion with his hand.
          Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
          chimp. Then another one. Then another.
          The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND

          ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

          MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
          Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
          of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
          Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
          orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
          immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big
          â¢ party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
           Caesar watches, satisfied, as the apes feast together.

          EXT. ATRIUM/TREE - DAY

          Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes.
          Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha.
          Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with
          a group of females. He follows her movements with his
          eyes...
          Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.

                         MAURICE
          Why cookie Rocket?

                         CAESAR
          Need strong. All apes strong.

                         MAURICE
          No understand.
          Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.

                         CAESAR
          Gorilla.
          He breaks another twig.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Orangutan.
          He breaks another.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Chimpanzee.
          He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they
          can't be broken.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          Apes.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Establishing shot. A beautiful morning.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

          Will's getting ready for his day. Hair wet from the shower,
          buttoning up his shirt, he pauses to pour himself a cup of
          coffee, look up at the clock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.

                         WILL
          Someone's sleeping late today -
          Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Dad?

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          LONG SHOT of Will sitting at a gravesite service, surrounded
          by twenty-odd PEOPLE. WE RECOGNIZE Stewart, Jacobs, one of
          the Aides.

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Will waits at the picnic table. He's been there a while.
          Finally Rodney appears.

                         RODNEY
          Sorry - can't get him to come out.
          He won't budge.

                         WILL
          He knows I'm here?

                         RODNEY
          I told him.
          Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.

                         RODNEY (CONT'D)
          Hey - you are not allowed back

                         THERE -
          Will ignores him, keeps going.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a
          common area away from the bars.
          Will runs up to the cage.

                         WILL
          Caesar - please! I've got
          something to tell you -

                         (BEAT)
          It's about Walter.

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s
          heard Will's words.
          Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.

          NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
          NASA has temporarily lost
          communication with the Icarus.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Will sits with a glass of Scotch, watching TV. Stewart's
          looking at a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.

                         NEWSCASTER
          Captain Taylor and his crew are
          navigating the ship around the dark
          side of Mars. Communication is
          expected to be reestablished -

                         WILL
          I was too late.
          She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.

                         STEWART
          You tried. You worked really hard.
          Walter knew that.

                         WILL
          Wasn't good enough though, was it.
          ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his
          two teenage sons...

          INT. LAB - NIGHT

          Franklin's on the phone.

                         FRANKLIN
          Just checking in. You didn't show
          up at work today.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. EVANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR
          FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine.

          FRANKLIN (O.S.)
          Hope you're feeling better - let me
          know if you need anything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
          blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless
          eye.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice
          grabs his arm.

                         MAURICE
          Where go?

                         CAESAR
          Find Mother.

          EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT

          Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the

          GATE.
          As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
          OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
          go with him.
          Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
          To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
          gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S

          EYES HAVE CHANGED.
          Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
          Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE

          UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
          Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
          remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
          wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
          Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
          Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
          anything.

          EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living
          â¢ quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Middle of the night, only a few cars.
          Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for
          a break in traffic, cross the highway.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

          In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the
          night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

          Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.

          SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE
          A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.
          Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the
          suburban street.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.

          CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.
          WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?

          CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.
          It's coming from outside.
          REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
          moves to the window, looks into the back yard.

          THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
          Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
          Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.

          THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
          It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
          darkness.
          He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.
          His face is impossible to read.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter
          along the mantle.
          Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the
          hallway.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the
          doorway, taking it in.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from
          Will's house.

          EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY
          GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.
          Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a
          spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE
          AIR, head toward the Primate House.

          INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT

          The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his
          shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two
          chimpanzees run across the grounds.

          EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
          the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW
          OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.
          Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.
          Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to
          the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in
          through the window.
          Rocket follows.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT

          Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on
          the office computer - doesn't hear anything.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
          drop to the cement floor.
          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED
          FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into
          each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.

          A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED

          BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.

          IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.
          Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH

          KOBA.

          HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.

          THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES

          SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
          Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
          Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.
          Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED

          IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

          KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING

          HIS CAGE.

          ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.
          ANGLE ON Caesar.
          He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the

          DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.
          These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.

          NO CONNECTION.
          Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,
          stares back at him.
          Caesar turns away, crestfallen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.
          He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB
          CHIMPS start to SCREAM.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

           HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.

          KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.
          They stare at each other.
          Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on
          his nightly rounds.
          They look at each other, lay low.
          To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED

          SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-

          TALKIE.
          But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.

          EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off
          together.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S

          KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
          Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
          behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
          Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
          swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
          oblivious.
          Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.

           INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and
          â¢ closes the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          CLICK. It locks into place.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING

          Dawn of a new day.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING

          Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's
          face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
          Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING

          Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still
          asleep.
          There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.
          Caesar freezes.
          Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the
          shovel. Locks the door behind him.
          He hasn't seen Caesar yet.

                         DODGE
          Rise and shine, assholes.
          The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in
          the common area.

          THEN DODGE SEES HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          What the hell -
          (seeing Cornelia's open

                         CAGE)
          You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
          do that?
          Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds
          it in front of him.
          He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're gonna go slow here, alright?
          You're gonna go back in your cage,
          you're not going to give me no
          trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,
           riveted, waiting to see what will happen.
          Cornelia stands, watching.
          Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is
          unreadable.
          Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL

          AGAINST THE BARS.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Back!
          Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
          Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,
          Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.
          Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
          the orangutan cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're going to have you fixed,
          Einstein, that's for damn sure...
          But first we're going to figure out
          how you pulled this off...

          CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Go on. Get in that cage.
          Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          I said get!
          But Caesar doesn't move.
          Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
          floor.
          He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
          handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get in that cage, you damn dirty
          ape!

          â¢ CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL

          HEIGHT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH

          TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.

                         CAESAR
          (with his voice)
          No!

          STUNNED SILENCE.

          THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.
          Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.
          Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.
          Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,
          trying to comprehend what has just happened.
          And then... they go nuts.

           SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
           That's when Caesar attacks.
           He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
           Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN

           THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
          Dodge staggers back.
          Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
          Dodge crumples forward.

          CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
          Lights out.
          Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
          Rocket helps pull him inside.

          THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE

          APES COME STREAMING OUT.
          They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS

          AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
          Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
          out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE

          SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

          HANDS TOGETHER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices
          the palm and places his hand against it.
          Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest
          and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

          OPEN PALMS WAITING.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

          He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
          pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
          Strange.

          THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.
          Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES

          CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.
          He stands there, stunned.

          JACOBS (O.S.)
          Will? Hello? Will pick up the
          goddamned phone!

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING


                         WILL
          Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.

                         JACOBS
          The animal handler - Franklin - was
          killed last night. In the primate
          house.

                         WILL
          Franklin's dead?

                         JACOBS
          Something very powerful broke his
          neck. Snapped it in two.

                         WILL
          Could it have been one of our
          chimps?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JACOBS
          All our apes are accounted for - â¢
          secured in their cages. But here's
          the kicker: One of our security
          guards swears he chased a
          chimpanzee off the grounds last
          night.
          Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's
          swing.

                         JACOBS (CONT'D)
          Where in the hell did that chimp
          come from?!

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE -- MORNING

          Will speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's
          dialing her cell phone.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.

          MR. LANDON
          The Ranch. Landon speaking.

                         (LISTENING)
          Hey Stewart.

                         (LISTENING)
          Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast
          about half an hour ago...
          He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and
          ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Let me call you back...
          He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the
          kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets.

          MR. LANDON (CONT'D)
          Hey Dodge - Stewart just called -
          WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...

          INT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING

          .kitchen.

          MR. LANDON
          She said that -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE

          STANDING IN THE KITCHEN.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING

          The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.
          Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops.

                         STEWART

                         (ON PHONE)
          No one's answering.
          In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch
          house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is
          visible.
          Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.

                         WILL
          You go get help.

                         STEWART
          Not a way in the world. I'm coming
          with you.

          EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

           They sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet.

          INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

          But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately
          visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed,
          cupboards emptied.

                         STEWART
          Oh my God... I'm calling 911..
          Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window.
          HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE,
          LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.

          AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          .CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.

                         WILL
          Caesar.
          Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's
          trembling.

                         STEWART
          It's going to take them at least
          half an hour to get here.
          He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an
          empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a
          couple of stray COOKIES.
          He has an idea.
          Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                         WILL
          I'm going to kill him.

                         STEWART

                         (HORRIFIED)
          Caesar?

                         WILL
          He's dangerous.

                         STEWART
          You're wrong - he can't have been
          the one who killed that man -

                         WILL
          There is no other explanation.
          A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart
          turns. Now there's another.
          They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.
          Will barricades the back door with a table.
          Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.

          GLASS SHATTERS.
          Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door

          CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

           INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY


                          WILL
           Caesar! I need to talk to you!
           Dodge, Rodney and Landon watch as Will and Stewart are pushed
          into the cage next door.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Caesar!

                         DODGE
          Welcome to the mad house.

                         STEWART
          I called Animal Control - they'll
          be here soon -

                         WILL
          (through the bars)
          I just want to talk to you!

                         DODGE
          Well this'll be interesting because
          your freak'll talk back.

                         RODNEY
          Dodge thinks he spoke to him.

                         DODGE
          He did! He said the word "no" -
          right to my face.

                         WILL
          What do you mean?

                         DODGE
          He can talk.

                         STEWART
          That's impossible.

                         DODGE
          Then he must have a voicebox in his
          ass, because I heard him!
          Caesar walks up.
           Will steels himself, feels in his pocket - the POISONED
          COOKIE is ready.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         WILL
          Caesar - people are coming. People
          with guns. You've got to make the
          apes go back in their cages.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Apes no belong in cage. Human put
          apes in cage.
          Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent.
          He means what he's saying.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

                         (SIGNING)
          Never again.
          Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST

          BE DONE.
          Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds
          it out.

                         WILL
          I brought this for you.
          Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (it's killing him)
          Don't you want it?

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Never.
          They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but
          now with a vast chasm between them.

                         WILL
          You went to the lab last night. I
          know it was you.
          Caesar doesn't deny it.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          (emotion spilling over)
          How could you kill that man,
          Caesar? Once you kill you can't it
          back - that man's gone forever.

          WILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          It gives him pause.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill.

                         WILL
          But...

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Caesar no kill!
          Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.
           Rocket immediately comes over to stand by Caesar, but Caesar
          doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will.
          He turns, begins to walk off.

                         WILL
          Don't walk away. We need to talk.

          CORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT

          THE COOKIE ON THE GROUND.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Don't - !

          TOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP.

          FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE,

          AND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED

          AROUND KOBA'S ARM.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Where'd he get that wristband,
          Caesar? That's Koba's band...

                         (REALIZING)
          Did Koba get out of his cage??
           Yelling after Caesar.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
           Caesar wait!
           But Caesar's not waiting.

           EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

           Caesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick-up truck.
          â¢ Apes gather around, expectant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         CAESAR

                         (VOICE STRAINING)
          No.
          At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.
          FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)
          C...Cage!
          The humans' jaws drop, petrified.

                         CAESAR (CONT'D)

          NO CAGE! NO MORE'.

          CAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA.

          THE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN.
          BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED.

          APES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH.
          Will - and the other humans - are blown away.

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          The pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate
          and moves out over the countryside.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          ANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the
          ranch.

                         VOICE
          They could be spread out all over
          the County by now.
          Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER
          HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.

                         WILL
          No - they'll stick together.

                         DODGE

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          They're following one ape. You
          kill him, you stop them all.

                         HUFFS
          There's a leader?

                         (POINTING)
          Ask him - he raised him.
          All eyes to Will.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. If I can
          reason with him, I know I can put
          an end to this.

                         HUFFS
          Reason with him?
          Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad
          car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.

                         WILL
          You don't understand - this chimp
          is smart - he'll listen to me

                         HUFF
          (to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER)
          Get on the horn with every agency
          you can think of! We've got to
          track down these monkeys before
          they do major damage!
          The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge
          follows.

                         DODGE
          You need me riding with you. I've
          got experience with these animals.
          (eye on Will)
          I can point out the one you want.

          EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY

          An AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front.
          Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS.

                         OFFICER
          (handing Jacobs a card)
          If you think of anything else, this
          is where I can be reached -
          A RUMBLING SOUND from behind.
          They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way.
          Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.

                         Â¢
          The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

          Caesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.
          No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated.
          Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as
          apes around him go crazy.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          A stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie.

                         OFFICER
          We have a situation at Gen-Sys
          Laboratory! Approximately two
          dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know
          what the hell they are -
          AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,

          DESTRUCTION.

          INT. MOVING SQUAD CAR - DAY

          Huffs drives - Will in the front, Stewart in back. They can
          hear everything through the radio.

                         WILL
          The lab.

                         HUFFS
          You know anything about this?

                         WILL
          That's where I work.

          INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE/TREATMENT ROOMS- DAY

          ANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through
          white rooms, tearing everything up.
          EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind
          desks.

          ANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113.
          Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on,
          thrown against the wall.
          Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          EXT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled
          behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching
          from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize
          that everything has GONE SILENT.
          A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.

                         OFFICER #1
          Here they come!

          A MASS OF PRIMATES BARREL TOWARD THEM.

                         OFFICER #2
          There's more of them!

                         JACOBS

                         (REALIZING)
          Those are my chimps...
          They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over
          the car they're crouched behind.
           BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad
          car - and their heads.
          The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use
          Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.
          The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.
          And then they're gone. Every last one of them.
          Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and
          devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive
          party.
          Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON

          BROKEN GLASS.
          Jacobs freezes.
          KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at
          each other for a long moment.
           Then Koba calmly walks past him.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through
          the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others
          Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING

          THAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR.

          IT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113. THE NOZZLE'S

          BROKEN OFF.

          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          Four HELICOPTERS wait. Hoff s, Will and Stewart climb into
          one of them.

          INT. ASCENDING HELICOPTER - DAY


                         HOFFS
          Any idea where they're headed?
          Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter
          below. He doesn't like it.

                         WILL
          No.

                         HOFFS
          They were seen heading north from
          the lab - let's start with that.

          EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

          A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG
          moving in.
          KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
          A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a
          bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands.

                         GIRL
          Monkey!
          OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then
          another. And another.

          REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR

          WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.
          suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.

          PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS.
          The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)
          Mommy?
          The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't
          get to her.

                         MOTHER
          April!
          Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up
          and puts her down out of harm's way.
          Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where
          he's going.
          SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat,
          looking down at the city below.

                         HUFFS
          You see them?

                         WILL
          No, I can't see -

                          STEWART
          Oh my god.
          Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW:
          it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl -
          chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along
          parallel streets...
          She realizes something.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I know where they're going.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY


          A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO.
          FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors.
          The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping
          low overhead. Faces turn skyward...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos.
          PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM.
          Released balloons float lazily upward.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways,
          dodging people, jumping over benches.

                         WILL
          He's going to release the apes.
          Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off -
          but hesitate.
          The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

          As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS.
          Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth.

          INT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY


                         WRANGLER
          What the hell am I supposed to do
          when they get here?!
          An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape
          Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know
          something's coming.
          Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,
          turns to see Caesar and his apes.
          Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.
          The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.

          SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN.

           INT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY

          All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from
           their separate enclosures.
           Caesar's apes are waiting for them.
           Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE
          CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.

          By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.
          Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some
          News Crews.

          INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

          Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the

          That's him! The one with the white

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY

          Apes leap over cars, run in and out of traffic. PEDESTRIANS
          take cover.
          SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS.
          Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters.
          Caesar slows with her, concerned.
          SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her
          speed.
          Caesar continues on.

          Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's

          Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown
          larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North
          through the San Francisco streets.
          Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic,
          shimmering in the afternoon light.
          And Will realizes the moment he sees it.

          They're going to Muir Woods.
          (turning to Huffs)

          The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a
          stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead.
          But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she
          stumbles, falls.
          Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches
          her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips.
          She's been poisoned.

          Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's

          Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN.

          entering the bridge and waving exiting traffic through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          Suddenly, OUT OF THE FOG, THE APES APPEAR.
          TRAFFIC slams to a halt.
          PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER
          THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding
          across the bridge.
          Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to
          get a safe shot.

          AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.
          A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles
          ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,

          THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.

          DODGE IS AMONG THEM.

          AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE
          Caesar and his apes race forward.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream
          Northward, over and around stopped cars.

                         HUFFS

                         (INTO HEADSET)
          Tell them to hold their fire until
          they get past the traffic!
          WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a
          place on the bridge where there are no more cars.
          Then they'll be open season.
           Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
          north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot
          behind them.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the
          bridge traffic.
          Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad
          cars.
          He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION

          CABLES.
          Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.
          Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
          swirls hundreds of feet below.
          Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
          taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
          the fog. Rocket's right behind.
          The remaining apes follow.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
          Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
          fog.
          Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
          And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
          traffic.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
          apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.

                         ABOVE BRIDGE
          Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
          the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
          They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

          SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
          A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
          A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
          the chimp hits the water.
          They keep moving.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
          Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.

          DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

          LOADS.
          They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
          apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
          of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
          practically zero.

          NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

          IN THE FOG.

                         OFFICER
          They're all around us!
          Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -

          WHOOSH...
          DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
          of some visibility.
          That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

          CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

          WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
          There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
          the fog.
          He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
          cable.
          ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
          AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
          Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

          CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.

          ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

          UP.
          Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

          THE MAIN CABLE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          BAM!
          Rocket's hit in the back!
          He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE

          BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
          Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
          But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

          THE BRIDGE.
          The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

          THE BARRICADE.
          Like a freight train of menacing power.
          Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
          back up.
          A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
          And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
          MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
          Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
          waged above is audible.
          He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.

                         AERIAL VIEW
          As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON

          CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND

          APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
          Vanquishing the humans.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND

          CARS.

          BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.

          DODGE.
          Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires

                         Â¢
          again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,

          PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.
          Dodge's body twirls through the air -

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY

          HITS THE WATER.
          Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
          bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...
          .disappearing into the dense park.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS PARK/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.
          HELICOPTERS above.
          Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
          ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
          Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.

                         OFFICER #1
          We can't gas the forest! The
          slightest wind would take it over
          to Tiburon.

                         OFFICER #2
          Well it'll take us months to find
          them in there.

                         OFFICER #3
          Not to mention rounding them all
          up.
          Will approaches the group.

                         WILL
          I know where they are.
          The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
          Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.

                         HUFFS
          This man owns one of the chimps.

                         (BEAT)
          The so-called "leader". Says he
          can reason him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         WILL
          His name is Caesar. I think he'll
          listen to me. If he comes out, the
          other apes will follow.
          Sounds pretty far-fetched.

                         OFFICER #1
          You think you know where to find
          this monkey?
          Will starts to correct him - lets it go.

                         WILL
          I do. I used to bring him here.
          The Officers look at each other.

                         OFFICER #1
          We don't have a lot of options.
          Let's give it a try.

                         WILL
          But you have to promise me - if I
          can get them out, you'll take them
          peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage
          them. No killing.
          Beat.

                         HUFFS
          Whatever it takes.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
          the path Caesar and Will used to take.
          She's terrified, trying to mask it.

                         WILL
          You think this is a bad idea?

                         STEWART
          Definitely.
          He thought so.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          He's never going to agree to come
          out with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         WILL
          I know. Got to try, right? I owe
          him that much.
          Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,
          turns to look at her.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (YELLING BACK)
          Think he'll forgive me?

                         STEWART
          (can't quite hear him)
          What?
          Will waves it off - never mind.
           Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into
          the woods.

          EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK

           Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
          he follows it.
          CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
          More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
          Will follows.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Will enters the clearing.
          He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
          CANOPY that Caesar always loved.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an

          ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.

                         HUFFS
          Follow me.
          Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S

          DIRECTION, GUNS READY.

                         STEWART
          Hang on a second...
          (to nearest Officer)
          Where are they going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
          with all her might.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)

          WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.

                         WILL
          Caesar! ...
          He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN

          FRONT OF HIM.

          IT'S KOBA.
          Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
          neck.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You.
          Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
          He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
          this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
          Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
          away.

          ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST

          STARES HIM DOWN.

          KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
          Which leaves just Will and Caesar.

                         CAESAR
          Humans coming.

                         WILL
          No. I'm alone.
          Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I owe you an apology.

                         CAESAR
          Will want Caesar dead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         WILL
          I thought you had killed a man.
          But I should have known better.
          Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
          thinking.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          I want you to know that all of this
          is my fault. My responsibility.

                         (BEAT)
          Can you forgive me?
          BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.
          Will realizes he's been betrayed.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          Wait - no -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave.

                         WILL
          I won't -

                         CAESAR
          Will leave now.

                         WILL
          No. I'm staying with you.
          Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
          At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
          Huffs takes aim at Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)

          NO!

          HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST

          OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.

          AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH
          - a COUNTERATTACK.
          Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
          but not fast enough.

          UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE

          APES' FAVOR.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE

          CARNAGE.

          EXT. WOODS - DUSK

          Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
          blood.
          Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
          Then the life passes out of him.

          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK

          Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
          at the forest in the gathering darkness.
          All is quiet.
          The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.

          HONK OF A HORN.

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
          rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.

                          TAXI DRIVER
           Where to, my man?
          It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT

          GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.

                         HUNSIKER
          SFO. International terminal.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          You got it.
          The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
          forehead - he doesn't look too good.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

          INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
          wheels through the airport terminal.
          It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
          Hunsiker takes the escalator up.

          INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

          Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
          front of the plane.

          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

          Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
          a switch.

          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

          The airplane takes off into the sky.

          NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)
          As the ape search continues, a
          virulent flu strain has exploded in
          and around San Francisco, sending
          shock waves and panic throughout
          the community.

          EXT. CLEARING - DAY

          We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
          of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
          Authorities suspect the origin of
          the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
          Laboratories - the same private
          company from which several
          laboratory chimpanzees escaped
          earlier this week -
          We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
          it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
          We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
          move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING

          APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
          All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.

          As the death toll rapidly rises,

          meet the growing demand...
          Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.

                         (INCREASINGLY DESPERATE)
          Although isolated in the western
          region of the country, the numbers
          are catastrophic and quickly
          rising...
          Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #5
          Efforts to quarantine appear to
          have failed. The strain has been
          spotted as far away as Singapore
          and Australia...

          CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.

          stay inside your homes...

                         (LONG BEAT)
          For those of you who can hear me, I
          say...

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          God's speed and so long to you all.
          The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A

          SNOWY TELEVISION SET.

          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY

          The intense BUZZING of summer insects and the SONG of
          songbirds. A birds eye view of a bucolic mid west farming
          landscape, corn field, blue skies, sunshine, a FARMER
          PLOUGHING a nearby field with a TRACTOR, grain silos and a
          hay stack. A MAN with a horse. A clapboard house with a
          strawberry field, a woman's hand picks strawberries; a WOMAN
          lying in grass, lazing...

          OPENING CREDITS...

          INT. DINING ROOM/HOME - NIGHT

          Next to book shelves and an upright piano, with sheet music
          on the stand - CHOPIN. There is also a dining room table with
          leftovers from an abandoned meal - strawberries and cream.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

          MONTH LATER - a warm night, the MAN is asleep with the same
          WOMAN, now pregnant, no sheets on the bed. The MAN is
          restless and wakes. A distant RUMBLING, indistinct - the MAN
          swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window,
          anxious.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The MAN is in his shorts, sweating, putting a plug in the
          bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go. The
          WOMAN appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans
          against the door frame watching, blearily, cradling her
          pregnant belly.

          WOMAN. 
          Why are you taking a bath? 

          MAN. 
          I'm not. 
          The WOMAN takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath. 

          WOMAN. 
          You'll sleep better. 
          He looks at her, surprised she's misunderstood. 

          MAN. 
          I'm not! Put your clothes back on. 
          She sees he's looking out the window now - there's an eery 
          rose-colored glow of distant fire through the glass - and 
          distant shouts and screams...

          END OF FLASHBACK: 

          TITLE: THE ROAD.

          EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN

          A MAN of about forty and a BOY of ten are asleep, camped on a
          tarp under a rock ledge, the blackened chasm of a burnt
          valley spread out below. It is the same man seen earlier -
          but ten years older, thinner, malnourished, with a thick
          beard. They are both emaciated and exhausted, their faces and
          hands coated in grime and soot from the burned, blackened
          landscape around them. Ash falls on the tarp, which is bright
          synthetic blue, the only color in sight.
           The MAN is woken by something, he instinctively reaches out 
           to touch the BOY, his hand rests on his chest and rises and 
           falls with each of the sleeping BOY's breaths. 
           There is a low RUMBLE, the ground starts to TREMBLE and the 
          BOY wakes. 

           BOY. 
           Papa? (NO REPLY.) Papa? 

           MAN. 
           Shh. It's okay. 

           BOY. 
           What is it, Papa? 
          They listen as it grows NEARER and LOUDER, everything
          SHAKING, tree roots GROANING and SPLITTING, until it passes
          between them with a ROAR like a subway train right beneath
          them. The BOY is now clinging to the MAN and crying, his head
          buried against his chest in fear.

          MAN. 
          Shh. It's all right. It's all 
          right. It's gone. 

          BOY. 
          What was it, Papa?

          MAN.
          It was an earthquake.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          In the burnt, barren landscape, through swirls of soft ash
          and smoggy air the MAN appears dressed in a filthy old PARKA
          with the hood up, a knapsack on his back, pushing a rusted
          shopping CART with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and
          the BLUE tarp now covering it's load. The little BOY,
          similarly dressed with a KNAPSACK on his back, shuffles
          through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl
          homeless.
           There is a flicker of lightning over head, then more, but no 
          thunder. 

           MAN. (V.0.)
          The clocks stopped at one seventeen
          one morning. There was a long shear
          of bright light, then a series of
          low concussions.

          EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/ CRACKED ROAD - DAY 

           Broken asphalt, the earthquake has caused a large FISSURE to 
          open up ALONGSIDE the road, with a sheer drop. 
           THE MAN and THE BOY edge past burnt trees and scrub. 

          MAN. (V.0.)
          Within a year there were fires on
          the ridges and deranged chanting.
          The screams of the murdered. By day
          the dead impaled on spikes along
          the road.

          EXT. LAKE - DAY 

           They trudge past a vast lake filled with dead trees... 

           MAN. (V.0.) 
           I think it's October but I can't be 
           sure. I haven't kept a calender for 
           5 years. 

          EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY 

          They truck along with the trolley through the fog, the
          ghostly shapes of dead trees on either side and the shapes of
          barren mountains in the background...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN. (V.0.)
          Each day is more gray than the one
          before. Each night is darker -
          beyond darkness. The world gets
          colder week by week as the planet
          slowly dies. No animals have
          survived. All the crops are long
          gone.

          EXT. EDGE WOODS - DAY 

           A tree falls behind them with a WHUMP and they jump... 

           MAN (V.0.) 
           Someday all the trees in the world 
           will have fallen. 

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 

           The MAN forages for petrol, checking the nozzle of the pumps, 
           rummaging through empty oil cans, he upends a bin to get at 
          the empty oil bottles. 
           The BOY picks up a phone on a wall and listens to the dead 
          earpiece. 

           MAN. (V.0.)
          The roads are peopled by refugees
          towing carts and road gangs
          carrying weapons, looking for fuel
          and food.

          EXT. LONG ROAD - DAY 

           They head down a long straight road towards a dark, 
           forbidding looking tunnel - a turnpike. 

           MAN. (V.0.) 
           There has been cannibalism. 
           Cannibalism is the great fear. 

          EXT. CITY - DAY 

           They emerge before a view of a deserted city-state... 

          EXT. MALL - DAY

           They forage in a deserted mall... 
           There are skeletons and human bones here and there. 

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         CONTINUED:

           MAN. (V.0.)
           Mostly I worry about food. Always
           food. Food and our shoes.
           CU - the BOY examines the head of a moose mounted on a wall 
          in a SEARS hunting store. 

           MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Sometimes I tell the boy old
          stories of courage and justice -
          difficult as they are to remember.
          All I know is the child is my
          warrant and if he is not the word
          of God, then God never spoke.

          END OF CREDITS/MUSIC. 

          EXT. RIDGE/ CAMPSITE - (CAMP 2) - EVENING 

           They are camped high up on the ridge of a mountainside. 
           There is a camp fire with wet clothes hanging to dry on
          sticks beside it.
           The MAN is erecting the tarp over string tied between two 
           sticks stuck in the ground. The BOY is sitting lighting a
           lantern using the scavenged oil inside the makeshift tent, 
           his shadow stark against the illuminated tarp. 

           BOY. 
           Now you can read me a story. 
           He gets out a BOOK and looks at the pictures in the
          lamplight.
           The MAN reads him a story... 

          EXT. RIDGE/CAMPSITE - (CAMP 2) - NIGHT 

          The MAN awakens bathed in firey light as if the sun has come
          out. There is pale gray snow all around him with a quivering
          orange glow. He gets up to investigate, looks to the line of
          trees up the ridge where a FOREST FIRE is burning, CRACKLING
          in the distance. He stands staring at the fire, the warmth
          and light moving him, enlivening him and not frightening him
          at all. The BOY has got up and appears at his side, yawning.
          He looks at the sky at a single gray SNOWFLAKE drifting down.

          BOY.
          It's snowing!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          It's like it used to be when the
          sun came out.
           The BOY catches the snowflake in his hand, surprised.

          EXT. ROAD/PLAIN - DAY

          They travel along the road through drifting wood smoke, smoke
          pouring off the ground like mist and thin black trees burning
          like candles on the snowy ridge.
          They reach a spot where fire has crossed the road melting the
          tarmac. Their feet stick in the molten tarmac, it sucks at
          their shoes and they stop. Just ahead they see a set of foot
          prints in the tar and study them.

          BOY.
          Who is it?

          MAN.
          I don't know.
          The MAN looks through a pair of BINOCULARS and sees: A
          stooped figure up ahead, a DYING MAN dragging one leg
          slightly, limping along. He stops and stands uncertainly,
          then continues. The BOY sees him too.

          BOY.
          What should we do Papa?

          MAN.
          We're all right. Let's just follow
          and watch.

          BOY.
          Take a look.

          MAN.
          Yeah. Take a look.

          EXT. ROAD/HILL - LATE AFTERNOON

          The DYING MAN is getting slower and slower as they climb a
          slope, following, until he finally stops and simply sits in
          the road. The BOY hangs onto the MAN's coat anxiously as they
          approach.
          POV BOY - the DYING MAN is burnt, his clothing scorched and
          skin black with soot. One eye is burnt shut and his hair is a
          nitty wig of ash. His shoes are bound with wire and coated
          with road tar.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CONTINUED:
          As they pass by the DYING MAN looks down, averting his eyes.
          The BOY keeps looking, unable to take his eyes off him.

          BOY.
          Papa, what's wrong with that man?

          MAN.
          He's been struck by lightning.

          BOY.
          Can't we help him? Papa?

          MAN.
          No. We can't help him.
          They keep walking away and the BOY tugs at the MAN's coat.

          BOY.
          Papa?

          MAN.
          Stop it.

          BOY.
          Can't we help him, Papa?

          MAN.
          No. We can't. There's nothing to be
          done for him.

          EXT. BRIDGE - (CAMP 3) - EVENING

          They are camped under the bridge, ash and slurry drift by on
          the river, a dull sulphur light from the fires glows against
          the sky. The BOY sits in silence with his back to the MAN. 

          MAN.
          There's nothing we could have done.
          (NO REPLY.) He's going to die. We
          can't share what we have or we'll
          die too.

          BOY.
          I know.

          MAN.
          So when are you going to talk to me
          again?

          BOY.
          I'm talking now.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Are you sure?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          EXT. BARN - DAY

          They come to a barn beside the road. They look at each other.

          MAN.
          Let's take a look.
          The man picks up the revolver and they go inside cautiously.

          INT. BARN - DAY

          Three pairs of FEET wearing different shoes - a man's shoes,
          a woman's shoes, and a CHILD's sneakers - hang above three
          carefully placed chairs.

          MAN.
          Don't look.
          The BOY looks at the ground.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You don't need to see this.
          The BOY takes a few steps, exploring, he eyes the empty hay
          loft but avoids looking at the hanged bodies.

          BOY.
          There could be something here.
          There could be corn or something.

          MAN.
          No, they ran out of food.

          BOY.
          Maybe we could find some hayseeds
          in the hayloft?
          Now the BOY goes over to the swinging CORPSES, oddly curious.

          MAN.
          It's not what-you think. They
          committed suicide.

          BOY.
          What does that mean?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          You know what that means.
          The MAN GOES outside while the BOY thinks about it a moment.

          EXT. FARM GATE - DAY

          They walk away from the eerily silent farm, stopping at an
          abandoned TRACTOR by a weathered, paint stripped letter box. 

          MAN.
          Come here.
          The BOY goes over and the MAN takes out his revolver, opens
          the magazine and shows him: two bullets in the chamber.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You see that? Two left. One for you
          and one for me.
          He places the BOY's thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol.
          He curls the BOY's index finger around the trigger.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You put it in your mouth and point
          it up. Like this. Just like I
          showed you.
          He puts the barrel of the pistol in his own mouth until the
          BOY nods, wide eyed. He takes the pistol out of his mouth and
          uncocks it.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You got it?

          BOY.
          I think.

          MAN.
          Is it okay?

          BOY.
          Okay.
          The MAN puts the gun away and cuddles the BOY close. They set
          off again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          FLASHBACK - the WOMAN is sitting by the window, staring out
          at the garden which is barren now, the sky gray but tinged
          with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash
          covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy
          and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone. A pile of
          broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up
          next to the fireplace. In the fireplace the scorched, ashen
          remains of piano keys. The WOMAN is now heavily pregnant. The
          MAN sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans
          from a pot and sits to eat.
          As the WOMAN starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look
          of horror, spoon halfway to her mouth. She looks down and

                         SEES:
          POV WOMAN - water and blood running down her legs. 

          WOMAN. 
          Oh no. Oh no.

          MAN.
          It's okay, I'll help you. Just like
          we said.

          WOMAN.
          No no no...

          MAN.
          I'll heat water. We can do it. 
          As he goes out she MOANS in despair.

          INT. KITCHEN/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN rushes in and opens a drawer in the sideboard.
          Instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears, a
          bottle of antiseptic, worn but clean towels and a pair of
          worn out yellow rubber dish gloves, all laid out in
          readiness.
          The WOMAN appears at the door, blood running down a leg.

          WOMAN. 
          We don't have to.

          MAN.
          Well, I think we probably do.

          WOMAN. 
          What kind of life is this?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          It's life. It's the only thing
          left.
          He takes the WOMAN back into the other room.

          INT. DINING ROOM / CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 

           TERRIBLE SCREAMING. The WOMAN lies on the dining room table 
           SCREAMING as she has her first contractions. The MAN is
           wearing the rubber gloves, one gloved hand resting on the 
           WOMAN's leg, about to deliver his own baby. He wipes his brow 
          and leaves a smear of blood as the SCREAMING goes on.

          WOMAN. 
          I can't.

          MAN.
          It's coming.

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          INT. TRAILER HOME - (CAMP 4)- EVENING 

           Inside a badly damaged trailer home, one wall half fallen 
           off, a pan of water boils on a small fire. The BOY sits 
          shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin, scraping
          around for the last one or two. The MAN opens his knapsack by
          the fire and produces a packet of COCOA. He fixes a cup of
          cocoa for the boy. He hands the BOY the cup of cocoa and as
          the BOY examines it and drinks, the MAN surreptitiously pours
          himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it. The BOY
          realises the MAN has left him all the cocoa.

          BOY.
          You promised not to do that.

          MAN.
          What?

          BOY.
          You know what, Papa. I have to
          watch you all the time.

          MAN.
          I know I'm sorry.

          BOY.
          If you break little promises you'll
          break big ones. That's what you
          said.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN relents, pouring the hot water back into the pan and
          taking some of the BOY's cocoa into his own cup. The BOY
          wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and
          licks his finger.

          MAN.
          Watch your finger.

          BOY.
          You always say that.

          MAN.
          That's because you always do it.
          The MAN spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and
          studies them.

          BOY.
          What are you doing?

          MAN.
          We have to keep moving. We have to
          go south to the coast.

          BOY.
          Why?

          MAN.
          It'll be better at the coast.

          BOY.
          Why?

          MAN.
          Because we're going to freeze here.
           He picks up the map pieces carefully. 

          EXT. TURNPIKE - MORNING 

           The MAN and the BOY truck along the blacktop. 
          At the crest of a hill they come to FADED BILLBOARDS
          advertising MOTELS and stop. The BOY notices a sign in the
          distance, which has words painted over a faded advertisement:
          odd, nonsensical, Biblical ramblings about "bones" and "the
          dead." The MAN follows the BOY's gaze and reads: "BEHOLD THE 

          VALLEY OF SLAUGHTER - JEREMIAH 19:6." 

          MAN.
          Do you remember your alphabet?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          Yes.

          MAN.
          Can you read that?

          BOY (SCRUTINISING IT.)
          No.

          MAN.
          Good, let's go. 
          The MAN takes out a large REVOLVER, cocks it in readiness and
          places it on the tarp as they move. The BOY eyes the MAN
          nervously, eyes the gun and they move off. 

          EXT. TURNPIKE, TUNNEL APPROACH - DAY 

          They trudge along the turnpike towards the opening of a deep,
          black tunnel and the BOY suddenly comes to a stop,
          increasingly upset, unable to face the yawning mouth of the
          tunnel.

          BOY. 
          I can't, I just can't... 

          MAN. 
          There's no other way. 

          BOY. 
          We could go over. 

          MAN. 
          We can't take the cart over. 

          BOY. 
          We don't know what's in there. 

          MAN. 
          There's nothing in there. It's just 
          the same as it is out here. Okay? 

          BOY. (BEAT. VERY RELUCTANT.) 
          Okay. 
          The boy sticks close to the MAN's side. The man has the 
          revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped, ready as 
          they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. TUNNEL - DAY

          The MAN has his arm around the boy as they push the cart
          cautiously ahead, acutely aware of all that's around them.
          They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground. Ash
          and litter blowing about and a handful of MUMMIFIED DEAD
          REFUGEES appear along the sides of the tunnel, sitting and
          lying on camp stretchers, their bags and supplies long since
          looted. They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk,
          shoeless, a couple of men, a woman a small child and a DOG.
          The MAN stares at the group. 
          The BOY stares at the small child and then at the mummified 
          DOG, transfixed. The MAN puts out his hand for the BOY to
          take - the BOY takes his hand and the MAN moves him on.

          MAN.
          Just remember that the things you
          put into your head are forever.

          BOY.
          But you forget some things don't
          you?

          MAN.
          You forget what you want to
          remember and you remember what you
          want to forget.

          EXT. TUNNEL EXIT AND TURNPIKE - (CAMP 5) - EARLY MORNING 

           The MAN and the BOY are asleep inside an abandoned car 
           amongst a line of other abandoned vehicles littering the 
          turnpike. 

          INT. ABANDONED CAR - (CAMP 5) - EARLY MORNING 

           Now the BOY's hand rests on the MAN's chest as he sleeps. The 
          MAN breathes stertorously, wheezing a little and the BOY'S
          small hand goes up and down on his chest.
          Suddenly the MAN wakes and rolls onto his side, listening,
          the revolver lying beside him. He slips his hand onto the
          revolver and raises his head slowly. He looks around - 
          nothing but the sound of a distant DIESEL ENGINE. He looks at
          the BOY fast asleep. When he looks back at the tunnel he sees 
          a nightmarish vision:

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         CONTINUED:
          POV MAN - Exiting the tunnel, shuffling through the ash, a
          group of HOODED MEN, some in gas masks and filthy biohazard
          suits, slouching along, coughing, casting their heads from
          side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a ROAD
          GANG. The MAN listens to the sound of a DIESEL TRUCK behind
          the gang.

          MAN.
          Quickly. Quick...
          The BOY jolts awake as the MAN shoves his pistol in his belt,
          grabs the boy by the hand. They slide out of the car and 
          crouch on the ground, the BOY is frozen with fear. 

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          It's all right. It's all right but
          we have to run. Don't look back.
          Come on.
          Their backpacks are still left in the back of the car... 

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Run... run...
          The flat bed truck RUMBLES into view, MEN from the GANG
          standing on the flat bed looking around, some holding rifles.
          The BOY falls and the MAN pulls him to his feet with such
          force he lifts him clean off the ground and has to dangle him
          back down again.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           You okay? It's all right... come
           on...
           They rush down the embankment into the trees alongside the 
          turnpike. 

          EXT. TURNPIKE UNDERPASS - DAY 

           They run through the woods. The truck is heard in the 
           background, the motor missing and SPUTTERING, coils of black 
          diesel smoke coiling through the woods. The motor dies with a
          flapping RATTLE and there's SILENCE. 
          The MAN and the BOY crouch in frozen silence, the Truck now
          on the overpass nearby, dangerously exposed to the view of
          the Gang. They listen to the GANG TALKING and raising the
          hood of the truck
          The MAN puts his arm around the BOY and draws his pistol as 
          they see the truck begin to roll, the GANG pushing it... but 
          it coughs and stalls again.

          16.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN sees one of the GANG MEMBERS coming down the
          embankment, unbuckling his belt. He is emaciated, in dirty 
          blue overalls and a gas company cap, and has a long beard cut
          square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on his neck.
          He doesn't stop, just keeps coming, closer and closer until
          he's just feet away, almost on top of them. He unzips his
          pants and takes a piss. As he stands pissing his eyes roam
          around - at any moment he could look to the side and see them
          crouching there.
          The MAN is wide-eyed, gun ready, eyes darting from the GANG
          MEMBER to the BOY to the GUN. The GANG MEMBER rolls his
          shoulders and exercises his neck... he looks down and studies
          the steam coming off his piss.
          The MAN silently trains his pistol at the head of the GANG
          MEMBER who, as if by instinct, rolls his head around and
          looks right at him.

          MAN.
          Just keep it coming.
           The GANG MEMBER sees the gun and stops pissing, looks back at
          the truck, zips his fly.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          Don't look at them. Look at me. If
          you call out you're dead. Where you
          from?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Does it matter? Where you from?

          MAN.
          What's the truck running on?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Diesel fuel.

          MAN.
          Where d'you get that?

          GANG MEMBER.
          I don't know.

          MAN.
          You don't know, huh?
          The GANG MEMBER just stares, not answering.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You got ammunition for those
          rifles?
          The GANG MEMBER looks back towards the truck.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          I told you not to look back there.
          Where d'you get all that stuff?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Found it.

          MAN.
          What are you eating?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Whatever we can find.

          MAN.
          Whatever you can find, huh?

          GANG MEMBER.
          Yeah...
          Now the GANG MEMBER looks at the BOY, causing the MAN To
          raise the revolver and cock it.
          POV GANG MEMBER - he looks down the barrel at the magazine
          and sees empty space.

          GANG MEMBER. (CONT'D)
          You won't shoot that thing. You
          ain't got but two shells. Maybe
          just one. And they'll hear the
          shot.
          On the over pass the ROAD GANG are looking around, MURMURING
          as they notice one of their number missing.

          MAN.
          Maybe. But you won't. It'll be
          through your skull and inside your
          brain before you can hear it.
          The MAN steps closer and aims the gun at the MAN's forehead,
          hammer back, ready.

                         (CONTINUED)

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          To hear it you'll need a frontal
          lobe and things with names like
          colliculus and temporal gyrus and
          you won't have them anymore because
          they'll just be soup.

          GANG MEMBER.
          Are you a doctor?

          MAN.
          I'm not anything anymore.

          GANG MEMBER.
          We got a hurt man. It'd be worth
          your while.
          The MAN glances in the direction of the ROAD GANG, then back
          at the GANG MEMBER, who is still eyeing the BOY. The BOY is
          sitting with his hands on top of his head, peeking out
          through his arms, terrified as the tension escalates.

          MAN.
          If you look at him again I'll shoot
          you in the head.

          GANG MEMBER.
          I'll bet that boy is hungry. Why
          don't you all just come onto the
          truck. Get something to eat. Ain't
          no need to be such a hard ass.

          MAN.
          You don't have anything to eat.
          Let's go.

          GANG MEMBER.
          I ain't going nowheres.

          MAN.
          You think I won't kill you but
          you're wrong.

          GANG MEMBER.
          You know what I think? I think
          you're chickenshit. You never
          killed a man in your life.
          He drops his belt on the ground with a CLATTER, a canteen and
          army pouch hanging from it. The MAN eyes the army pouch, eyes
          the GANG on the road - and notices for the first time some of
          them are wearing the same army pouches.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         CONTINUED: (4)
          One is banging his stick on the side of the truck to call
          their lost member. The MAN is distracted by this and when he
          looks up the GANG MEMBER has taken two silent steps and is
          standing between him and the BOY, holding a knife.

          MAN.
          What do you think you're going to
          do with that?
          Without a word the GANG MEMBER dives and grabs the BOY, rolls
          and lands on his feet holding the BOY against his chest with
          his knife at his throat. Simultaneously the MAN drops to his
          knees, trains the pistol and fires from six feet away,
          shooting the GANG MEMBER in the forehead. He falls back and
          lies with blood bubbling from the wound, eyes open, the BOY
          lying in his lap in shock, deafened, expressionless, covered
          with gore and mute as a stone.
          The GANG hear the loud SHOT and freeze, they start looking
          around them more urgently now. The MAN grabs the dazed BOY by
          the hand and yells but in his deafness the BOY hears only a
          MUTED soup of words:

          MAN (MUTED.)
          Move! Let's go!
          The MAN shoves the pistol in his belt, hoists the BOY onto
          his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          They crash through the woods, the MAN straining to keep the
          BOY aloft and find a path through the trees - the BOY
          clutching the MAN's head with both hands.
          There's a sickening THUD and the MAN falls, the BOY flying
          off with a cry. The MAN struggles to gather his wits, unsure
          whether he's been felled by another man.

          MAN (MUTED.)
          Come on. Get up, get up quickly!
          The MAN swings the BOY onto his shoulders and runs.

          EXT. WOODS/TURNPIKE - DAY 

          The MAN and BOY stagger through trees and the man drops to
          his knees, letting the BOY down. They are back by the
          turnpike again. They listen and watch, utterly exhausted and 
          out of breath, the MAN is wheezing, the BOY at his side,
          holding his hand, staring, in shock still.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Shh. It's okay now. You're going to
          be OK.
          POV BOY - the BOY can still HEAR nothing, temporarily deaf.
          But he sees the MAN talking and looking around, through 360
          degrees, trying to work out where it's safe to go.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          Come on.
           He grabs the BOY's hand and they take off again.

          EXT. WOODS - EVENING

          The MAN pulls out blankets from his knapsack. The BOY sits
          staring, shocked as the MAN tries to wipe the blood and gore
          from his face but it's thick and congealed now. His hands
          tremble as he tries to pick it from the BOY's hair.

          MAN.
          It's okay... it's okay now...
          Frightened by the BOY's muteness, he wraps him in a blanket,
          unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka.
          The MAN picks up his revolver, checks the chamber, only one
          bullet left. He eyes the flickering shadows in the distance
          and then eyes the BOY, making minute calculations of
          distance, calibrating the space between the ROAD GANG and the
          BOY. He holds the revolver up and cocks it.

          MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I try to look like any common
          traveling killer but my heart is
          hammering. When it comes to the boy
          I have only one question: Can you
          do it? When the time comes?
          There is no moon, but not far away, perhaps 30 yards, a firey 
          TORCH makes its way through the woods. About 50 yards away
          from that another TORCH is being used to search... shadows
          flicker ominously. The sounds of TWIGS snapping underfoot and
          BRANCHES being broken as the ROAD GANG searches wordlessly,
          just BREATHING heavily through their masks and beards. The
          MAN clutches the BOY tighter, and stifles a cough.
          They remain frozen like this, unable to budge.

          FADE OUT.

          EXT. EMBANKMENT - DAWN

          They are by a thin, toxic, rust-red stream, slushy ice at the
          edges and gray froth. The MAN leans down and pushes ice away 
          and scoops up a hand full of gray water. He runs it through
          the boy's hair to wash it and the BOY flinches with cold. He
          rubs more icy water into the BOY's hair, roughly, quickly,
          with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to-wash out
          lumps of flesh and blood. The BOY is weeping silently and
          shivering from the extreme cold as the MAN picks out the
          dried gore and washes the hair clean.

          MAN.
          It's no use crying. You have to
          talk to me.
          He takes the blanket and dries the BOY's hair as he talks.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to let anything
          happen to you... I'm going to take
          care of you... I'm always going to
          try and be here for you... and I'm
          going to kill anybody who touches
          you.
          He smooths the BOY's hair down with shaking fingers, clumsily
          trying to brush it out of his eyes, a fatherly instinct to
          make the BOY neat.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Because that's my job. Do you
          understand?
          When he's through the MAN lifts the BOY's thin arms, puts a
          vest over his head, then a ragged sweater, then he folds the
          BOY into his parka, zips it up to the neck and kisses him on
          the top of the head.
          The MAN grabs his knapsack, tips it upside down, rummages
          inside - it's empty.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          Come on, we need to get the cart
          back.

          EXT. EMBANKMENT BY TUNNEL EXIT - DAY 

          Approaching the embankment, the MAN walks quickly and
          stealthily, wired, listening to the silence, straining to
          hear, sure he's being watched.

          22.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY stumbles along behind, slower, fatigued, makingthe
          MAN anxious. The MAN leaves the boy hiding:

          MAN (WHISPERS.) 
          Wait here.
          He starts to climb the embankment and hears: little running 
          FOOTSTEPS as the BOY comes after him, he turns to face the
          BOY urgently, exasperated.

          MAN (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
          No I need you to wait. I'll hear
          you if you call. I'll just be a
          little ways and I'll be able to
          hear you if you get scared and you
          call me and I'll come right away.
          He walks off but hears... the little BOY's FOOTSTEPS running
          after him again - he turns around.

          MAN.
          I said wait!
          The BOY's face crinkles up and a tear rolls down.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Stop it. I need you to do what I
          say. Take the gun.
          The BOY freezes, refusing to take the gun.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Just take it will you?
          The BOY shakes his head.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          We don't have time for this. We
          need our food. What's left.
          The MAN shoves the gun into the BOY's hand.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           Don't argue.
           He creeps up the embankment. The BOY just stares at the 
          revolver.

          EXT. TURNPIKE ROAD - DAY 

           The MAN searches for the cart. He comes to where they'd left 
           it in between the abandoned cars. 

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Their backpacks lie open on the ground, next to the cart on
          it's side, it's contents spilled out, mostly plundered, just
          a few children's BOOKS and TOYS, old pots and pans, shoes and
          ragged clothing remaining. Nearby are the remains of a large
          campfire in the middle of the turnpike. The man collects up
          the few remaining possessions and puts them into the
          backpacks.
          POV MAN - he sees charred billets of wood, ash and... the
          bones of the shot ROAD GANG MEMBER. Nearby is a pool of his
           blood and guts, still gently STEAMING, the head decapitated 
           and rolled under a car. He nudges the bones with the toe of 
          his shoe. 

          EXT. EMBANKMENT BY THE TURNPIKE - DAY 

          Below, down the embankment the BOY is waiting obediently with
          the gun.
          The MAN heads back to the BOY, trying to think what to say.
          The BOY hands the gun back and takes the MAN's hand and they
          walk away into the woods, the MAN tucking the gun back into 
          his belt. 

          MAN.
          Let's get out of here. The
          freeway's too dangerous. Find the
          back roads.

          BOY. 
          Okay. 

          INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - NIGHT 

           FLASHBACK - Now the house is in considerable disrepair, no
           furniture, the skirting boards falling away, large cracks in
           the walls, cornices and lamp fittings pulling away from the
           ceilings, water marks from rain, the windows covered with 
           corrugated iron sheets. The MAN and the WOMAN are sitting 
          across from each other with a lamp illuminating the dark.
          Between them lies the revolver seen earlier. The WOMAN picks 
          up the gun and swings open the magazine. There are two
          bullets in it, she takes them out and places them on the
          table, one after the other.

          WOMAN. 
          That's all that's left. I should
          have done it when there were more
          bullets in the gun.
          The MAN shuts his eyes, unable to take it. In the corner, the
          BOY is standing in the background, drawing on the walls.

          happen.

          MAN.
          Please.

          WOMAN. 
          Stop it.

          MAN.
          I'll do anything.

          WOMAN. 
          Such as what?
          She picks up the revolver and puts the TWO BULLETS into the
          chamber.

          WOMAN. (CONT'D) 
          I thought about not even telling
          you. Just doing it. I'd empty every
          godamn bullet into my brain and
          leave you with nothing.

          MAN.
          Don't say that. Don't talk this
          way.

          WOMAN. 
          There's nothing left to talk
          about... my heart was ripped out of
          me the night he was born...

          I don't want to survive! I'd take
          him with me if it weren't for you.
          You know I would. Why can't you

                         CRAZY -

          WOMAN. 
          It's not crazy and you know it.
          It's the right thing to do.
          They glance at the BOY. 

          WOMAN. (CONT'D) 
          Other families do it.
          She goes to the BOY, strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a
          reassuring display of being motherly.

          WOMAN. (CONT'D) 
          Time for bed, there's a good boy.
          She picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed.

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          EXT. RAVINE/WATERFALL - DAY

          The THUNDER of a waterfall, the river disappears into space -
          the BOY and the MAN stand staring up at the waterfall, 80 
          feet above, shrouded in gray mist. A color spectrum is 
          visible rising from the waterfall, like a rainbow - the boy
          is transfixed, clutching the MAN's arm for safety.

          BOY.
          What is it?
          The MAN looks at the BOY, surprised he's talking again.

          MAN.
          It's a waterfall.

          BOY.
          Look. Colors.

          26.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          There used to be color everywhere.
          You don't remember. It was before
          you were born. There used to be so
          many thnings... 
          The BOY approaches the water's edge, shallow and clear with 
          gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom. He scoops up some
          water, surprised that it seems clean.

          BOY.
          Look. It's clear.

          MAN.
          Do you want to go in?

          BOY.
          I don't know.

          MAN.
          Sure you do.

          BOY.
          Is it okay?

          MAN.
          Just don't swallow any.
          The MAN unzips his parka and slips it to the ground. The BOY
          eyes the MAN, surprised - then does the same.

          EXT. RIVER/WATERFALL - DAY

          Naked, pale, filthy dirty and shivering with cold, the BOY
          frolics in the spray of the waterfall. The MAN watches him 
          enjoying himself by the waterfall, clutching his shoulders, 
          hopping up and down, he joins him.

          EXT. RAVINE/ROCKFACE - (CAMP 6) - EVENING 

          The MAN has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a
          shelter. He meticulously filters water through a rag into a
          pan. In the background, the waterfall can be heard RUMBLING.
          The BOY has painted his face with CRAYONS, drawing a bizarre
          set of FANGS and dripping blood around his mouth. The MAN
          studies the BOY's painted face a moment.

          MAN.
          Listen. That man back there...
          there's not many good guys left,
          that's all. We have to watch out
          for the bad guys.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          And we have to talk. Always. We
          have to just... you know... keep
          carrying the fire...

          BOY.
          What fire?

          MAN.
          The fire inside you.
          The BOY is thoughtful a minute, and then:

          BOY.
          Are we still the good guys?

          MAN.
          Yes. We're still the good guys.

          BOY.
          And we always will be no matter
          what happens?
          He eyes the BOY uncertainly, unsure if he can promise this.

          MAN.
          Always will be. Yeah.
          The MAN goes back to tying the tarp.

          EXT. THE RIVER/VALLEY - MORNING

          The MAN and the BOY are trudging along, away from the 
          waterfall now.

          MAN.
          We have to keep moving. Other
          people might be attracted to the
          waterfall just like we were. We
          wouldn't hear them coming.
          They stop to look at a lake surrounded by fog down in the

                         VALLEY

          BOY.
          Do you think there could be fish in
          the lake?

          MAN.
          No. There's nothing in the lake.
          They move on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          EXT. BACK ROAD - DAY 

          They come around a bend in the road and immediately hear the 
          ROAR of river rapids. Up ahead they see a bridge with a jack-
          knifed TRUCK on it.

          EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

          They walk out onto the bridge over GREY FROTHING WATER, and
          inspect the truck. The tyres are flat, the cab jammed against
          the railings. The trailer end has swung across the road,
          knocked out the railings and lies with it's last few feet
          hanging over the side of the bridge, blocking the bridge off
          completely.

          EXT. ABANDONED TRUCK - DAY

          The MAN climbs up onto the gas tanks, wipes the glass and
          peers into the cab. He swings the door open and climbs
          inside, pulling the door shut behind.

          INT. TRUCK/CAB - DAY

          He looks around at discarded detritus, old magazines and
          trash. He checks behind the seats where there is a mattress
          on a bunk and calls out.

          MAN.
          Come up here.

          INT. TRUCK/CAB - (CAMP 7) - NIGHT

          SNOW continues to fall on the dusty WINDSCREEN. Outside, all
          around snow falls, silently, covering the truck and the
          bridge, transforming it. They are both still awake, unable to
          sleep, staring at the transformed world, carpeted by snow.

          BOY.
          I'm hungry.

          MAN.
          I know. So am I.

          BOY.
          Can I ask you something?

          MAN.
          Of course.

          BOY.
          Are we going to die?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          No. Sometime. Not now.

          BOY.
          And we're still going south?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          So we'll be warm?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          And there might be food there?

          MAN.
          Everything depends on reaching the
          coast.

          BOY.
          Okay.
          The MAN draws a blanket around him and kisses him goodnight,
          it is now pitch black.

          MAN.
          Go to sleep.

          BOY.
          I wish I was with my mom.
          They are silent a moment, until:

          MAN.
          You mean you wish you were dead.

          BOY.
          Yeah.

          MAN.
          You mustn't say that. It's a bad
          thing to say.

          BOY.
          I can't help it.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

          MAN.
          I know but you have to. You have to
          stop thinking about her. We both
          do.

          BOY.
          How do I do that?
          The MAN is silent, lost in thought.

          EXT. TRUCK/CAB - (CAMP 7) EARLY HOURS

          The man gets down from the cab and walks a few feet in the
          dark and snow. He coughs a bit, takes a few breaths of air,
          and walks away from the truck, vanishing into the mist.

          EXT. CAMP/ROAD - (CAMP 7) - EARLY HOURS 

          The MAN is alone now by the road. He takes out his WALLET and
          sifts through: money, ancient cards, driver's license and a
          picture of HIMSELF and the WOMAN on their WEDDING DAY, which 
          he studies a moment sadly.

          MAN. (V.0.)
          She was gone, and the coldness of
          it was her final gift... she died
          somewhere in the dark... there is
          no other tale to tell.
          He lays everything out on the grey slushy ground, then flings
          the wallet into the river and walks back to camp, leaving the
          PHOTO and cards to blow away.

          EXT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE/YARD - NIGHT

          FLASHBACK - The WOMAN kisses the MAN. 

          MAN.
          Will you tell him goodbye?

          WOMAN. 
          No. I won't. I can't.

          MAN.
          Will you at least wait till
          morning? Stay with me through the
          night.

          WOMAN. 
          No. I have to go now.
          They kiss again, she turns and walks away out of the yard.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          What am I going to tell him? What
          are we going to do without you?

          WOMAN.
          You should move south. You won't
          survive another winter here.
          The MAN follows a few steps and she stops and turns to him.

          MAN.
          Why won't you help me?

          WOMAN. 
          I can't help you. Don't you
          understand? This is how I'm helping
          you.

          MAN.
          Where are you going to go? You
          can't even see.

          WOMAN. 
          I don't need to see.

          MAN.
          I'm begging you.

           WOMAN. 
           Please don't. Please.
           The MAN stares. She goes, vanishing into the darkness. 

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          EXT. CITY LIMITS - DUSK 

           The MAN stares. In the distance, a dead city. 

          EXT. OVERPASS/CITY LIMITS - EVENING

           The MAN and the BOY approach the edge of the city. Up ahead a 
          cluster of three tall buildings, a dozen or so floors of
          concrete and glass, the upper floors of one illuminated by
          the flickering fire glow of candle light inside. The MAN
          stops and stares and the BOY follows his gaze.
          In one of the illuminated windows a SILHOUETTE FIGURE stares
          back at them, somebody in the building. In another window
          another SILHOUETTE FIGURE is staring out, motionless, they
          could be refugees, cannibals or more mummified dead for all
          we know.

          BOY.
          Who are they, Papa?

          MAN.
          I don't know.

          BOY.
          What if it's more bad guys?

          MAN.
          It won't be more bad guys. Don't
          worry. Stay close.
          He takes hold of the gun and they walk in a different
          direction now, giving the high rises a wide berth.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           Keep low. We'll be okay.
           When they get to the end of the block they stop and the MAN
           checks around the corner before they cross the street. In the 
           distance three men appear, emaciated, slow-moving. They step 
           forward, stop and watch the BOY and the MAN. 

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS/CITY - DAY 

           The MAN, now carrying the revolver, and the BOY head off down 
           a railway track that leads away from the city. 

          EXT. COUNTRY RAILWAY LINE - DAY 

          In the country, along the railway, they see past a small road
          to a once grand house on a rise. It is tall and stately with
          white Doric columns across the front and a gravel drive that
          curves up from the road through a field of dead, foot long
          grass. They stand there staring at it, the BOY still holding
          the MAN's hand. The MAN listens - nothing but the WIND in the
          dead bracken, a CREAK of a door or shutter rattling.

          MAN.
          I think we should take a look.

          BOY.
          I'm scared.

          MAN.
          There's nothing to be scared of.

          EXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME 

          The MAN sets off up the drive. He stops and faces the BOY who
          is rooted to the spot.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          You want to stay here?

          BOY.
          No.
          The BOY joins him and they set off slowly up the drive,
          through patches of melting snow. There is a tall dead privet
          fence with a deserted birdsnest in it.

          EXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They climb the steps to the porch, the BOY clutching the
          MAN's hand. They notice a window is slightly open. The MAN
          goes to it, opens the window wide, looks inside.

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They climb through the window onto black and white marble
          tiles and the MAN carefully shuts the window a little so it's
          the same as when he found it. They regard the room, 
          binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair. An 
          elaborate staircase in front of them, William Morris wall
          paper, water stained and sagging, plaster moldings and
          cornices sagging from the ceiling.
          They cross back to the other side where there is a great hall
          of a drawing room, high ceilings, huge fire place with raw
          brick around it where the wood has been stripped, a pile of 
          warm-weather clothing, boots and backpacks on the floor by 
          the hearth. 

           BOY.
          Papa?

           MAN.
          Shh.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They creep in and find blackened pots and pans, a cord with a
          bell for servants, trash piled on the floor and work tops, a
          rusted sink covered in mould, bare cupboards. In the floor is
          a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate. The man examines it
          while the BOY tugs at his arm, frightened.

          BOY.
          Papa, let's go.

          MAN.
          There's a reason this is locked.

          34.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY is now panicky, hopping about, close to tears.

          BOY.
          Don't open it - don't!

          MAN.
          I need something to pry it open.

          BOY.
          No!
          The MAN goes out abruptly and the BOY follows, wringing his
          hands in fear.

          EXT. BACK GARDEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN comes out the back door with his revolver drawn,
          looks around and sees an old station wagon with flat tyres on
          the dead grass. Beside it is a 40 gallon cauldron on the
          blackened remnants of a fire. There is also a wooden SMOKE
          HOUSE with thin wisps of smoke coming off it. The MAN studies
          it nervously, sniffing the air, then goes to the tool shed
          and starts sorting through tools. He finds a long handled
          spade and hefts it in his hands.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch.
          The MAN hacks away, then prizes up the hatch, lock and all,
          revealing a gap of darkness.

          BOY.
          Papa...

          MAN.
          Listen to me. Just stop it. We're
          starving. Do you understand? I have
          to do this. I don't have any
          choice.
          The MAN opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Just wait here.

          BOY.
          I'm going with you.

          MAN.
          Okay. Just stay close to me.
          Nothing's going to happen.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         CONTINUED:
          They descend the rough wooden steps.

          INT. CELLAR/STATELY HOME - DAY

          There is a terrible stench and they have to cover their
          mouths and noses with their parkas. The MAN gets out his
          lighter, lights it and tries to light the way.
          POV MAN - BLACKNESS except the small area illuminated by the
          lighter as the MAN searches: part of a stone wall; then a
          clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains. The glow of the
          flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the MAN steps
          closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to

                         REVEAL:
          Huddled against the wall, all trying to hide, shielding their
          shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN, thin as
          skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps,
          shocked and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by:
          On a mattress on the floor lies a NAKED MAN with his legs
          gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned,
          cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes.

          MAN.
          Jesus...
          The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them and WHISPERS, a low
          indistinct murmur at first.

          MAN ON MATTRESS.
          Help us... please help us...

          MAN.
          Christ... oh Christ...
          The others join in, an eerie chorus of WHISPERING, "Help
          us... please help us..." The MAN turns and grabs the BOY and
          rushes for the steps.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Hurry... go... move!
          The MAN drops the lighter as he tries to push the BOY up the
          steps. Out of nowhere a BEARDED FACE appears at the foot of
          the stairs, blinking.

          BEARDED FACE.
          Please... they're taking us to the
          smoke house.

          36.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BEARDED FACE reaches out and feebly tries to grab the
          MAN's arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the
          BOY up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and
          missing his footing.

          MAN.
          Hurry - hurry!
          They scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as
          the BEARDED FACE reaches out and tries one last time to grab
          at the MAN's feet but he kicks free.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN scrambles out, slams the door shut and drags a solid
          table over the door. He looks around for the BOY.

          MAN.
          Christ. Run!
          The BOY is near the window, dancing up and down in terror,
          pointing out the window to:

          EXT. FIELDS - DAY

          Coming up the path toward the house are four BEARDED MEN and
          two WOMEN, all suspiciously well fed and healthy-looking. One
          of the MEN holds hands with one of the WOMEN, as if they were
          returning from a stroll before dinner.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN stares a moment, frozen with horror, then grabs the
          BOY by the hand and jerks him away.

          MAN.
          Run. Run!

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They tear through to the front door, the MAN fumbles to get
          it open but it has a well-maintained deadlock on it. He
          stares out the window next to the door and sees:
          POV MAN - The WELL-FED PEOPLE are climbing the steps of the
          porch. The MAN Grabs the BOY and they rush through into
          kitchen.

          INT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY

          In the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and
          the table elevating inches. They rush back out again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          As they reach the stairs, a key turns in the lock and the MAN
          picks up the BOY in his arms and they sprint to a door under
          the stairs. As they get through the door the front door
          swings open and the WELL-FED PEOPLE drift inside.

          INT. REST ROOM - DAY

          They are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet
          and a basin. The BOY's face is level with the basin and while
          the MAN is holding the door shut the BOY comes face to face
          with the contents of the basin:
          POV BOY - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and
          tallow in the basin. Around the basin are bloody red hand
          prints on the white porcelain.
          POV MAN - through a thin crack he sees the WELL-FED PEOPLE on
          the far side of the foyer, chatting casually. He is not close
          enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see
          that the MEN's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired
          clothes.

          WELL FED WOMAN.
          I'm going to freshen up.

          BEARDED MAN.
          I need a drink.

          WELL FED WOMAN 2. 
          I'm going up to change.
          He hears one of the WOMEN STOMPING across the old floorboards
          and up the stairs to change while the other WOMAN takes a few
          steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the
          window as the conversation lurches on.

          BEARDED MAN 2.
          Who left this window open?

          WELL FED WOMAN. 
          I leave it open for the smell.

          BEARDED MAN 2.
          What smell?

          WELL FED WOMAN. 
          You don't smell it anymore?

          BEARDED MAN.
          Who wants a drink?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         CONTINUED:
          They hear the sound of the WINDOW BEING CLOSED and LATCHED.
          As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide with fear,
          he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his
          haunches so he's close to the BOY, desperate, unable to
          decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear.
          The BOY is staring from the door to the pistol to the
          bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat.

          BOY. (MUMBLING, TO SELF.)
          Bad guys... bad men...

          MAN.
          Shh, shh...
          There are FOOT STEPS outside the door as the WELL FED PEOPLE
          drift closer and then away again. The man starts to cough but
          he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY's hand in his
          other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can't. Then the
          BOY notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN's mouth,
          stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside:

          WELL FED WOMAN.
          Will you help me with the dirty
          dishes?

          BEARDED MAN 2.
          I'm hungry.
          As the coughing subsides a little the MAN takes the BOY's
          hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it.

          MAN.
          Take it.
          The BOY tries to resist, shaking his head, terrified, mute.

          MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
          Take it.
          The MAN puts his left arm around the BOY's tiny, thin
          shoulders and holds him close.

          MAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D)
          Don't be afraid. If they get hold
          of you, you're going to have to do
          it just like everybody else. Do you
          understand? Shh. No crying. Do you
          hear me?
          The WOMAN turns from the window and one of the BEARDED MEN
          pours whiskey and hands her one.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The BOY is weeping and shaking his head as the MAN shows him
          again what to do with the gun.

          MAN (WHISPERS.)
          Stop crying. You have to be a brave
          boy. You know how to do it.

          BOY (WHISPERS.)
          I think so.

          MAN (WHISPERS.)
          Say "Yes I do Papa."
          He stares down at the little BOY who just holds the gun
          feebly... he realises the BOY won't use it. After a moment of
          torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes the gun
          from the BOY's hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down
          at his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY
          looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol,
          the MAN aiming the large revolver at the BOY's forehead.

          BOY.
          What are you doing?
          The MAN's hand shakes, his thumb trembles on the hammer as he
          cocks it...

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Papa?

          MAN.
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

          BOY.
          Will I see you again? When will I
          see you?
          The MAN's finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly
          squeezes it... At that moment there's a loud THUMP from the
          kitchen and the WELL FED PEOPLE stop and listen, then rush
          through to the kitchen, and immediately there's a commotion
          as they see the state of the hatch with the table over it.

          BEARDED MAN 2(O.O.V.)
          What the fuck do you think you're
          doing? Huh? What the fuck do you
          think you're doing...?

          WELL FED WOMAN (O.O.V.)
          Don't look at me like that. What
          are you doing?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         CONTINUED: ( 3)
          The MAN gathers his wits and opens the door a crack.

          MAN.
          Follow me, take my hand, don't let
          go.

          INT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN bursts out of the rest room with the BOY and they
          make a dash for the open window. He sticks his gun in his
          belt and wrestles with the window, an old colonial style
          frame which sticks.
          From behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled GRUNTS
          and SHOUTS until the MAN wrenches the window open, stuffs the
          BOY through and follows.

          EXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY

          The MAN picks the BOY up and they rush down the steps.

          EXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME - DAY

          They rush down the driveway and the MAN drags the BOY through
          a gap in the dead privet hedge onto the road.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          They hesitate a moment on the road, deciding.

          MAN.
          Come on, keep running!
          They rush across the road to the woods on the other side, the
          BOY ahead as the MAN checks behind them. The MAN looks back
          towards the house and two of the WELL-FED PEOPLE have come
          outside, looking around suspiciously.
          He hits the ground and takes the BOY with him, they lie flat
          at the edge of the woods and the road. They are wildly out of
          breath, chests heaving, the MAN coughing.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Keep your head down.
          POV MAN - the WELL-FED PEOPLE walk a few steps down the drive
          and a BEARDED MAN looks through BINOCULARS at the road and
          the woods, but not directly at the MAN and the BOY hiding.
          The WELL FED PEOPLE start looking around the side of the
          house, walking away. The MAN and the BOY get up, dash through
          the treeline and disappear into the woods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 

          .A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky and the outlines of trees
          as they set off through the woods, sleepy, stumbling like
          drunks now. They hear a hideous SHRIEK in the distance,
          coming from the house. They stop, hearing another SHRIEK and
          a MAN'S SCREAMING. The MAN holds the BOY close and tries to
          cover the BOY's ears as they stare and wait for-it to pass.

          MAN. 
          We'll be safe soon. 

          BOY. 
          They're going to eat those people 
          aren't they, Papa? 
          The MAN does not answer.

          EXT. SEARS DEPARTMENT STORE/SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

          They are back in the city, trudging through the parking lot
          of a huge shopping mall, just outside what used to be SEARS
          department store. A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky
          illuminates the ruined store front as the MAN looks up at the
          mall, thinking. The BOY is just staring into space, still in
          shock.

          INT. SEARS/MALL - (CAMP 8) - NIGHT

          The MAN and the BOY have set up camp in the mall, outside the
          SEARS entrance. The MAN is building a big fire. The BOY
          stares through the glass at the deserted department store.
          Nearby, strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of
          cash in notes and coins... the BOY looks closer and finds
          expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes, LOOTED from
          the store and discarded.

                          
          The BOY sits, he looks like he's given up, and then: 

          BOY. 
          Papa? Papa, we wouldn't ever eat
          anybody would we?

          MAN.
          No. Of course not.

          BOY.
          No matter how hungry we were. Even
          if we were starving?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          We're starving now.

          BOY.
          Because, because we're the good
          guys?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          And we're carrying the fire.

          MAN.
          Yes.
          The MAN takes the BOY in his arms. In a moment the BOY starts
          blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the MAN strokes
          the sleeping BOY's hair and kisses him on the forehead.

          EXT. SUPERMARKET/PARKING LOT - DAY

          They walk through the parking lot until the come to a
          supermarket around the other side. A few old cars in a trash
          strewn parking lot. The MAN heads through the defunct
          automatic doors.

          MAN.
          Come on. There's nobody here.

          INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

          The MAN and the BOY trudge the empty aisles, only litter
          remaining, the once brightly-colored packaging strewn around,
          it's contents long since looted.
          In the empty gun section there is a deer's head mounted on
          the wall. The BOY stops and stares, mesmerised while the MAN
          searches the empty shelves for ammo, finding only empty
          boxes.
          The MAN glimpses a woman's face staring dolefully from an
          aisle - an emaciated, dead beat SCAVENGER watching them,
          vanishing as quickly as she appeared. 
          On their way out they come to a pair of vending machines 
          tipped over, the sodas looted, coins scattered around in the
          ash. The MAN sits beside one and feels inside the gutted
          machine, eventually producing a single unopened can of COCA

          COLA.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY (EXCITED.)
          What is it, papa?

          MAN.
          It's a treat for you. Here. Sit
          down.
          He helps the little BOY off with his knapsack and sits him
          down and opens the can of COKE ceremoniously. The BOY looks
          startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if it's the strangest
          thing he's ever seen in his life.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Go ahead.
          The BOY takes the can.

          BOY.
          It's bubbly.

          MAN.
          Go ahead. Drink it.
          The BOY takes a sip and considers.

          BOY.
          It's really good. You have some,
          papa.

          MAN.
          No. I want you to drink it.

          BOY.
          But I want you to have some.
          The MAN reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip, hands
          it back to the wary BOY.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          It's because I'll never get to
          drink another one, isn't it?
          The MAN doesn't know what to say.

          EXT. MALL/PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

          They head out of the mall now towards the road, lifeless
          traffic lights at the intersection, town houses and apartment
          blocks on the other side of the road. The BOY stops to
          listen, stares around, suddenly energised, bobbing on his
          toes.

          MAN.
          What's wrong with you?

          BOY.
          What was that?

          MAN.
          I didn't hear anything.

          BOY.
          Listen.

          MAN.
          I don't hear anything.
          They listen more until, very faintly we hear a DOG BARK in
          the distance. The BOY turns around 180 degrees to listen,
          alert with anticipation.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          It's a dog.

          BOY. (EXCITED.)
          A dog! Where did it come from?

          MAN.
          I don't know. Come on.
          The MAN walks across the road, past the apartments and the
          BOY follows, bouncing up and down, over-excited now.

          BOY.
          We're not going to kill it are we
          Papa?

          MAN.
          What? No, we're not going to kill
          it. Why did you say that?

          BOY.
          You still got one bullet left.

          MAN.
          We're not going to hurt the dog, I
          promise. We're not going to kill it
          and we're not going to eat it
          either.

          BOY (OVER EXCITED, NOT FRIGHTENED.)
          Maybe it'll eat us!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

          MAN.
          I doubt it very much.

          BOY.
          Can we look for it?

          MAN.
          It's gone, okay?

          EXT. SUBURBS - DAY

          They trudge through the suburbs on the edge of the city, past
          what used to be the local ball park, now barren, dead, a vast
          flat expanse of ash and cracked, scorched earth, forlorn
          stands and bleachers blackened by ash and soot.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          I used to watch the ball games here
          with my father.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

          They walk up a once tree-lined suburban street, barren now,
          ash and dust layer what used to be front lawns, post boxes,
          picket fences, porches, crazy paving. The MAN stops outside a
          typical, suburban clapboard house with a dead, cracked yard
          where the lawn used to be and a bare flag pole. The BOY eyes
          the MAN enquiringly.

          BOY.
          What is this place, Papa?

          MAN.
          It's the house where I grew up.
          They go up to the house - clapboards have been removed for
          firewood leaving studs and insulation exposed. The BOY stops,
          reluctant to go further, and the MAN takes a few more steps
          then turns around to check on him.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You coming?

          BOY.
          I don't want to.

          MAN.
          Don't you want to see where I grew
          up?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          There might be somebody in there.

          MAN.
          There's nobody there now.
          The MAN takes the BOY's hand and they approach a basketball
          hoop by the garage. The MAN is momentarily overcome with
          emotion as he recalls the details, but it doesn't mean much
          to the BOY.
          After a moment the MAN goes up the steps - frightened, but
          horribly compelled at the same time. The BOY follows
          nervously.

          BOY.
          I'm scared.

          MAN.
          We've got to find something to eat.

          BOY.
          I'm not hungry. I'm not!
          The MAN takes his revolver from his belt and approaches the
          front door, warily pushing it open.

          MAN.
          We'll be all right. Come on.
          He goes through the front door - the BOY stays where he is,
          rigid with fear. The BOY notices a stuffed toy dog in the
          window, staring out at the garden and his curiosity takes
          over. The BOY goes inside carefully.

          INT. DINING ROOM/HOME - EVENING

          The pine panelling is stripped from the walls, there is some
          broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood. They
          go over to the fireplace and the MAN examines it. He runs his
          fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin
          still stuck in the wood, nostalgia overcoming his fear.

          MAN.
          This is where we used to have
          Christmas when I was a boy. We'd
          hang our stockings right here.
          The MAN examines the yellow tiled surround. The BOY watches
          the MAN as if he's gone mad.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          My mother scrubbed these every day.
          It's still spotless.
          Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped
          and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes.
          By the fireplace is a small pile of bones - and--in the grid
          are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat. The
          MAN takes it all in sadly but the BOY is unmoved.

          BOY.
          Papa? I don't think we should do
          this.

          MAN.
          You want to wait outside?
          The BOY nods vigorously.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          All right.
          He takes the BOY's hand and leads him out.

          EXT. PORCH/HOME - DAY

          The come out onto the porch.

          MAN.
          Sit here on the stoop and don't go
          away.
          The BOY sits quietly and the MAN goes back inside. After a
          moment he starts going through his knapsack, less afraid now.

          INT. OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The floorboards CREAK horribly, swollen from rain or ripped
          up, as he creeps into the living room. The timber cladding is
          stripped from the walls, the ceiling plaster is collapsed,
          beams exposed. The MAN pads through to the kitchen.

          INT. KITCHEN/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The kitchen is similarly dilapidated, the cupboards stripped
          bare. On a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit,
          preserved. He grabs a jar, prizes open the lid and finds a an
          oily slick of black mucus floating in the top, like rotted
          mushroom spores. He sniffs it suspiciously, holds it up to
          the light.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CONTINUED:
          In the light small black fish hook-shaped spores drift from
          the top of the jar to the bottom. He replaces the lid,
          appalled.

          EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The BOY is sitting on the steps of the porch drawing with
          crayons on a pad taken from his knapsack. Across the road is
          another big old house, much of the clapboard missing, swathed
          in dead brambles - the BOY suddenly looks up and stares at
          it, distracted.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The MAN comes outside and regards the deadened yard, old
          garden hoe and spade, gardening equipment and several dead
          apple trees. He goes over and examines the ashen ground and
          digs about to unearth several small, dark brown, shrivelled 
          spheres spaced several feet apart - apples. He bends down and
          picks one up, examines, sniffs. He gathers up the strange
          apples and stuffs them in his pockets.

          EXT. PORCH/OLD HOUSE - DAY

          The BOY is still staring at the house across the road when he
          notices A GHOSTLY FACE, completely still, in a window. The
          BOY drops the pad and crayon and stands, surprised, not
          believing his eyes - it is the face of a SMALL BOY roughly
          his age, which disappears almost immediately, receding back
          into the gloom like a ghost.

          INT. PANTRY/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

           The MAN is in the looted pantry. He finds some shrivelled 
           raisins that haves spilt and hidden in the back of the shelf. 
           He puts them into a handkerchief, folds it and pockets it. He 

                         HEARS:

          BOY. (O.O.V.)
          Stop - stop!
          The MAN freezes, then charges out.

          EXT. PORCH/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN rushes out and stares about frantically for the BOY -
          he's gone.

          EXT. HOUSE OPPOSITE - DAY

          The BOY has run across the road to another house.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         CONTINUED:
          POV BOY - peeping around the side of the house is the other
          SMALL BOY, the same age, similarly grimy and thin, wearing an
          outsize woollen coat. The other SMALL BOY disappears down the
          side and the BOY runs after him.

          BOY.
          Wait! Come back! I won't hurt you!

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          The BOY runs to the bottom of the yard where there is various
          suburban garden detritus, a dusty lawn mower, a clothes line,
          a shed, bikes with no tyres.

          BOY.
          Where are you?!
          The MAN comes sprinting up the side of the house and seizes
          him by the arm.

          MAN.
          What are you doing? What the hell
          are you doing?

          BOY.
          There's a little boy, Papa, I saw a
          little boy.

          MAN.
          There's no little boy. What's the
          matter with you?

          BOY.
          Yes there is! I saw him! A boy just
          like me.
          The MAN takes the BOY by the arm and drags him back through
          the yard, up the side of the house, the BOY resisting, crying
          and looking back all the way.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Why? Why can't I go and see him?

          EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          Out the front of the house the BOY digs his heels in and the
          MAN has to drag him, his feet slithering through the dirt.

          BOY.
          I need to see him! I need to!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Why?

          BOY.
          I just do!
          The BOY has gone limp, weeping bitterly, resisting being
          moved. The MAN gives up and squats beside the sobbing BOY.

          MAN.
          Okay, I'm sorry. I understand.
          He holds him, wipes his tears from his cheeks.

          EXT. TOWN STREET/OVERPASS - EVENING

          In the failing light they come across a late model Chevy
          abandoned under an overpass.

          BOY.
          Papa? Will there be other boys like
          me at the coast?

          MAN.
          I hope so.
          The MAN goes to the car, wipes thick dust from the windscreen
          and peers in - it's empty.

          INT. CHEVY - (CAMP 9) - NIGHT 

          They try to get comfortable in the leather seats, the MAN
          spreading the blankets over them and tucking the BOY in. They
          are quiet a moment as they watch darkness start to fall.

                         THEN:

          MAN.
          I got you something
          The MAN produces from his pocket one of the tiny hard brown
          apples and holds it up to the remaining light.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          It's an apple.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         CONTINUED:
          He hands it to the boy who examines it curiously. The MAN
          takes out a pocket knife, takes the apple back, cuts the
          apple in half to reveal a woody brown interior. They regard
          the mahogany apple uncertainly, the MAN is the first to take
          a bite, with some difficulty. The BOY bites his half and
          makes a face.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Suck it a while and it'll soften.
          They sit sucking and chewing the ancient apple.

          BOY.
          Did you ever have any friends?
          The MAN eyes the BOY - curious at the sudden question.

          MAN.
          Yes. I did.

          BOY.
          Lots of them?

          MAN.
          Yes...

          BOY.
          Do you remember them?

          MAN.
          Yes. I remember all of them...

          BOY.
          What happened to them?

          MAN.
          They died.

          BOY.
          All of them?

          MAN.
          Yes. All of them.

          EXT. URBAN ENVIRONS (MONTAGE) DAY

          there will be other children
          there... .When I have nothing else,
          I try to dream the dreams of a
          child's imaginings...

          EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY 

          The MAN and BOY walk along a desolate road in what was once 
          farmland, grain silos loom ominously, still standing. 

          BOY.
          Do you know where we are Papa?

          MAN.
          I think we're about two hundred
          miles from the coast. As the crow
          flies.

          BOY. 
          "As the crow flies?"

          MAN.
          It means, going in a straight line. 
          POV MAN - In the background, something catches his eye and he 

                         FOCUSES ON:
          A frieze of HUMAN HEADS, dried with taut grins and shrunken
          eyes, perched on wooden poles. Some are tattooed with targets 
          and runic slogans. Some are skinless, with signs and words
          inked onto them. One has suture marks etched on it, like a
          blue print for assembly.

          BOY.
          There aren't any crows are there?
          Just in books.

          MAN.
          Yeah, just in books...
          The MAN stares at the heads as the BOY continues his
          conversation, distracted and not seeing the heads. 

          BOY.
          Do you think there might be crows
          somewhere?

          But what do you think?

          MAN.
          I think it's unlikely...
          They keep walking and talking, the MAN grim-faced but the BOY
          intent on what's ahead.

          BOY.
          Could they fly to Mars or some
          place?

          MAN.
          No, they couldn't fly to Mars...

          Because it's too far?

          MAN.
          Yes.
          The MAN discretely hurries the BOY on with a guiding hand
          towards the woods and off the road.

          BOY.
          What if they tried and-and-and they
          just got halfway or something and
          then they were too tired? Would
          they fall back down...?

          EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 

          On the edge of the wood the MAN and the BOY stop to examine 
          footprints in the snow. 
          The MAN listens and hears: the low THUDDING of BULL DRUMS in 
          the distance. He looks at the exhausted BOY a moment.

          MAN.
          We can't go back on the road.

          BOY.
          Why, Papa?

          MAN.
          I think someone's coming.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY stares at the tracks. The MAN stares in both
          directions, examining the road in the distance. He moves a
          few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red
          neckerchief. He takes a few steps and through a gap in the
          trees sees a clearing - snow and a mass of BLOOD RED
          FOOTPRINTS, the icy snow stained blood red like a sorbet. A
          killing floor.

          BOY.
          Will they see our tracks?

          MAN.
          We'll cover them.
          The MAN moves the BOY away and kicks snow over their tracks -
          then lays fresh ones going in several different directions.
          The BOY copies him, leaving his own maze of tracks. They run 
          off keeping parallel with the road but staying off it. 
          POV MAN - in the distance TWO FIGURES appear on the road.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Here they come.
          The MAN now looks over his shoulder for a good look, then
          grabs the BOY's hand and takes off.

          EXT. HIGH GROUND - EVENING

          TWO MEN come prowling on the ROAD, they are MILITANTS from
          some sort of ARMY, wearing the same red neckerchiefs and
          carrying weapons, searching, predatory.
          WIDER - we see that only 30 feet away, concealed amongst the
          trees, the MAN and BOY are crouched in blankets, watching.
          The two MILITANTS stop and look around, as if they sense the
          BOY and the MAN - who freeze, frightened to breathe. The
          MILITANTS sniff the air menacingly.
          One of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road,
          leans down and starts sharpening his lance, made from a the
          straightened coil spring of a car. The MAN and the BOY watch -
          wide-eyed. Eventually the MILITANTS walk off up the road.

          BOY.
          What are we going to do?
          No answer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

          EXT. DEEP IN THE WOODS - (CAMP 10) - EVENING 

          There is a thick carpet of gray snow. The man lays out a tarp
          on the ground and blankets on top. Out of the murky sky more
          gray snow is falling. The MAN is distracted by a sudden
          noise, the LOUD CRACK of sheering wood - this time very
          close. He looks around just as:
          Out of nowhere a tree branch sails down, barely missing them, 
          landing with a heavy WHUMP just feet away. 

          MAN. 
          Move! Quickly! 
          He tries to get the BOY to his feet but he is limp, staring 
          around blearily, exhausted.
          They hear another loud WHUMP. Then the GROAN of timber and
          another WHUMP as trees start to keel over around them. The
          MAN grabs the BOY and runs as best he can through the snow
          and falling trees. They have abandoned their blankets, tarp
          and backpacks.

          BOY. 
          What's happening? 

          MAN. 
          Just keep moving, run! 
          They rush through the woods as more and more trees fall one
          after the other, WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP, great loads of snow
          falling from limbs to the ground with a BOOM, setting the
          woods shuddering. The BOY is getting bogged in the snow and
          the MAN stoops and scoops up the BOY and they cram themselves
          under a fat fallen tree to shield themselves.

           EXT. SEWER PIPE/EMBANKMENT, SNOWDRIFT - (CAMP 11) - NIGHT 

           They are huddled inside a huge SEWER PIPE, sheltering. 
           The BOY is wrapped up inside the man's coat, wet and 
           shivering, wide awake, nerves shredded, too anxious to lie 
          down and sleep now. 
          The MAN boils water in a car hubcab.
          He takes from his pocket the handkerchief filled with 
          raisins, offers them.

          BOY.
          That's all there is, isn't it?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         56

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          There's nothing left anywhere.

          MAN.
          No.
          They sit eating raisins, saying nothing until they're
          finished.

          BOY.
          Can I ask you something?

          MAN.
          Sure.

          BOY.
          Are we going to die now?
          The MAN just looks at the BOY, then looks away.

          MAN.
          What do you think is going to
          happen? We're just going to
          suddenly keel over and die? It
          takes a long time to die of
          starvation. The important thing is
          water to stop you dehydrating.
          We've got water. We'll be all
          right.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - MORNING 

          Snowed in farmland, in the background a rowoffallen and
          crumpled high tension electrical towers. Atownin the far
          distance ahead of the BOY and the MAN. TheBOYis hunched
          over with a hunger cramp. They are both wetandshivering.
          The MAN eyes the BOY anxiously.

          EXT. PATIO/TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

           The MAN stands on the back patio of a house on the edge of 
          town, the BOY at his side, fields stretching out before them,
          the land flattened and dead, ravaged fences running the
          perimeter. In the yard are a few dead trees, a fence, a metal
          tool shed, an old barbecue on the patio made from a 44 gallon
          drum. The MAN slides the patio door open and peers inside
          gingerly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          INT. BEDROOM/TOWN HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN is in the bedroom looking around for useful things -
          it has been stripped, the wooden frame gone from the window,
          the bureau ransacked and chopped up - only a summer dress on
          a wire hanger on the back of the door remains. He glances at
          empty drawers on the floor and a cupboard before turning his
          attention to the bed.
          He blinks and sways a moment, trying to focus on:
          POV MAN - underneath the filthy, dusty blankets a thin, dried
          head pokes out, the blankets pulled up to the chin. On the
          pillow are long hunks of rotted hair.

          MAN. (V.0.)
          Every day is a lie. But I am slowly
          dying. That is not a lie .I am
          trying to prepare him for the day
          when I am gone.
          He takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off
          the bed, revealing a desiccated corpse. He ignores it,
          shaking the blanket out and folding it under his arm. He
          notices the BOY at his side, watching wide-eyed.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Nothing you haven't seen before.
          They go out.

          INT. KITCHEN/TOWN HOUSE - DAY

          The MAN opens and shuts empty cupboards, slamming the doors,
          increasingly desperate, close to tears of frustration now.
          Eventually he feels dizzy and has to sit on the floor. He
          just sits there, alone on the kitchen floor, clenching and
          unclenching his fists, his head in his hands, when he hears:

          BOY. (O.O.V.)
          Papa!
          The MAN draws his pistol and goes out, alert again.

          INT. TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

          The BOY is staring at himself in a dusty, flyblown full
          length mirror. As the MAN comes in he sees the BOY's
          reflection and his own and jumps.

          BOY.
          It's us.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY stares at his reflection - he looks like an alien,
          skinny with giant staring eyes on shaky legs.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          We look skinny.

          MAN.
          We are skinny.
          The MAN puts the blanket around the BOY's shoulders. He
          notices an old upright piano, covered in ash and dust. The
          BOY stares as he goes to it, lifts the lid and plays a chord.
          The BOY's eyes light up and he is magnetized, instantly
          coming over and waiting for the next note. The MAN plays
          another chord.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          It's a piano.

          BOY.
          What's it for?

          MAN.
          For making music. This... (HE
          PLAYS.) is music. Your mother
          played very well.

          BOY.
          I don't remember. 

          MAN.
          Before you were born. We had one 
          just like it. It was beautiful. 

          BOY.
          What happened to it?

          MAN.
          Chopped it up for firewood.
          He stares into space, slumps suddenly, overcome with emotion 
          as he remembers: 

          INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 

          FLASHBACK - Just the MAN and the pregnant WOMAN alone in the
          house, just before the BOY was born. Some of the furniture
          has been broken up for firewood - there are broken pieces by
          the fire and a huge axe propped on the hearth.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CONTINUED:
          The WOMAN stands at the piano and tries to play. She plays
          for a moment and the MAN cracks a rare smile - the piano is
          out of tune and she stops. She plays a bit more but soon
          starts to bang the keys atonally in frustration. The MAN just
          lets her get on with it until she's spent.

          WOMAN.
          I used to worry what would happen
          if there was a fire. What would I
          save? What could I bear to lose?
          There used to be so many things, so
          many beautiful things. Things
          people made. Things nature made.
          Who knew we would lose it all?

          MAN. 
          I'll strip the floorboards. 

          WOMAN. 
          You can't live without a floor. 

          MAN. 
          You can't live without a piano. 
          She starts to dismantle the piano, opening the lid, taking it 
          off it's hinges, it's heavy, she hands him the heavy lid and 
          he reluctantly dumps it on the floor. 

          WOMAN. 
          It's my piano. 

          MAN. 
          I bought it for you. 

          WOMAN. 
          It needs tuning. Who's going to 
          tune it? Can you tune it? 
          They look at each other sadly. They take the front piece away 
          and dump that. The WOMAN picks up the axe and hands it to the 
          MAN. He swings it at the frame. 

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          EXT. YARD - DAY

          The MAN walks toward a tin shed and crosses the dead grass.
          He stops suddenly. He stamps about a bit, listening. He
          continues on into the shed. Beside the shed sits an
          INDUSTRIAL GARDEN TROLLEY. The man reappears, spade in hand.
          He digs the spade into the dead grass and hear's it CHOMP
          into wood. He digs more urgently, increasingly exhausted,
          until a door is revealed in the dirt.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         CONTINUED:
          He is so engrossed he hasn't noticed the BOY standing a few
          feet away, watching with saucer eyes, scared.

          BOY.
          Don't open it, Papa.

          MAN.
          It'll be okay.

          BOY.
          Please, Papa, please.

          MAN.
          It's okay.

          BOY.
          No it's not! What if there's people
          hiding down there?
          The MAN ignores him, focussed as he chops the plywood around
          the lock, gets the spade under a corner and levers the door
          open. The BOY has his fists bunched up to his chest, bobbing
          up and down with fear.
          The MAN starts to descend a hand made wooden stair case in
          the bunker. He takes another disposable lighter from his
          pocket, gives the child a kiss on the forehead and then 
          disappears into the bunker, leaving the worried BOY staring
          after him. The BOY looks around at the deserted yard as the
          evening draws in, now even more frightened.

          MAN. (O.O.V.)
          Oh my God... oh my God!

          BOY.
          What is it, Papa?

          MAN (O.O.V.)
          Come down. Oh my God come down.
          The BOY is in the hole and down the steps like lightning.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - EVENING

           The little BOY CLATTERS down the steps. The MAN is busy 
          lighting up candles. 

          BOY.
          Papa? What did you find?

          MAN.
          Everything. I found everything.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         CONTINUED:
          Stored in the bunker are crate upon crate of canned goods:
          tomatoes, peaches, beans, apricots, canned ham, corned beef,
          hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes paper
          towels, toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets.
          The MAN takes the BOY's hand and helps him down, then goes
          back up the steps and draws the door shut and jams a pair of
          metal pliers through the heavy inside hasp to stop the door
          being opened. He goes back down the steps to the BOY and
          holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Can you see?

          BOY.
          What is all this stuff?

          MAN.
          It's food! Can you read the labels?
          The BOY stares at the brightly colored packaging, he's never
          seen anything like it before. The MAN hands the BOY a tin.

          BOY.
          "Pears." It says "pears."

          MAN.
          Yes! It does! Oh yes it does!
          Pears!
          They inspect the shelves: chilli, corn, stew, soup, spaghetti
          sauce, the BOY's eyes are like saucers.

          BOY.
          Is it real?

          MAN.
          Oh yes, it's real all right.
          The MAN pulls a box of butane lighters from the shelf and
          tests one, it doesn't work. He tests another which works, it
          has a large flame - he uses it to read the labels.

          BOY.
          Why is it here?

          MAN.
          Because someone thought it might be
          needed.

          BOY.
          But they died.

          Yes. What would you like for
          breakfast?

          BOY. (THINKS.)
          Pears.

          MAN.
          Pears it is.
          The MAN claws open a box and pulls out a tin of pears. He
          gets paper bowls from a stack, plastic forks and spoons, lays
          them out. He finds a camping lamp. He puts a butane cannister
          in and lights up the lamp. He finds a can opener and opens 
          the pears while the BOY watches silently, wrapping a blanket
          around himself and sitting on the soft bunk bed.

          BOY.
          Is it okay for us to take it?

          MAN.
          They'd want us to.
          The MAN dishes up two bowls of pears and they sit side by
          side on the bunk with spoons and pears.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          These will be the best pears you
          ever tasted. The best. You just
          wait.
          They eat in silence. They lick the spoons and drink the syrup
          from the bowls. The MAN feels inside his mouth with his
          fingers - the sugar irritating a sore tooth.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
           Too sweet.
           The BOY smiles, amused, and the MAN opens another tin. 

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12)- EVENING 

           Ham and powdered eggs frying in a pan on the camping stove. 
           The kettle is boiling on another ring of the gas stove. The 
          BOY just stares at the bubbling food as the MAN cooks.
          Nearby a breakfast table is set out on a stack of boxes
          acting as a breakfast bar: biscuits, a plate of butter,
          condensed milk, salt and pepper plates and utensils.

          63.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN brings the pan over and forks over chunks of ham onto
          the pates, then spoonsfull of scrambled eggs from a second
          pan, then baked beans from a small pot. The BOY just stares,
          as if drugged, uncomprehending, the food alien to him.

          MAN.
          Go ahead. Don't let it get cold.

          BOY.
          What do I eat first?

          MAN.
          Whatever you like.
          The BOY eats a hunk of ham as the MAN pours coffee.

          BOY.
          Is this coffee?

          MAN.
          That's right. Careful it's hot.
          He hands him coffee.

          BOY.
          We did good, didn't we Papa?

          MAN.
          Yeah, we did good.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12)- NIGHT 

          The MAN puts the BOY to bed in a bunk and smooths his filthy
          hair tenderly, smiling with relief, until the BOY shuts his
          eyes and nods off. He covers the BOY with a blanket and
          kisses him. He just sits watching the BOY sleep, suddenly on
          the verge of tears.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - NIGHT 

           The MAN folds the BOY's tiny clothes, noticing the bulging 
           pockets of his pants. He empties them, creating a small pile
           of collected artefacts: a smooth stone, a marble, an old
           house key, bottle tops, a smooth, hand made Indian arrow 
           head, fashioned from stone, lastly a broken piece of a 
           woman's mother of pearl hair comb. 
           By the BOY's bunk he unfolds the crayon drawing he's been 
          working on and examines it, deeply moved:

          64.

                         CONTINUED:
          POV MAN - an eccentric, childlike drawing of the WOMAN,
          skinny like a stick figure but, inexplicably, with a brightly
          smiling face and big laughing eyes, labelled simply "mom" in
          spidery scrawl.
          Stirring classical music fades up and into:

          INT. THEATRE - EVENING

          FLASHBACK - Close in on a pair of LEGS in stockings, a summer
          dress, a WOMAN's hands holding a MAN's hand in her lap. The
          MAN feels the tops of the stockings with his fingers.
          WIDER - the MAN is with the WOMAN in a concert theatre, at a
          recital. The WOMAN wears the mother of pearl hair comb. The 
          seats are velvet, gold scrollwork adorns the boxes, an
          illustrious, fortunate world.

          END OF FLASHBACK.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING 

          The BOY wakes blearily and immediately notices his collection
          of artefacts turfed out by the bed.
          Nearby the MAN is dressing as the BOY starts gathering up his
          collection crossly, especially protective of the arrow ahead -
          or just embarrassed. They look at each other.

          MAN.
          What?

          BOY. (TEASING BUT INDIGNANT.) 
          Don't touch my stuff. 

          EXT. LAWN - DAWN

          The hatch opens and the MAN's face appears, as he looks
          around. He opens the hatch more and clambers out with a
          couple of jerry cans of water, the yard is quiet. Next, the
          BOY's face pops up and peers around. He clambers out carrying
          a big pot with a camping stove in it.

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAWN 

           They empty the jerry cans into the huge pot, light the stove
           and put the pot on the stove to heat the water. 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAWN 

           The BOY is in the bath, filthy and scrawny, as the MAN bathes 
          him, rubbing him with soap, scrubbing an oily film of scum
          from his dirty neck to reveal clean pale skin underneath.

          MAN.
          What do you think?

          BOY.
          Nice and warm.
          He washes the BOY's hair, lathing water over him with the
          pot. He has a sudden thought:

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

          FLASHBACK - the MAN watches unseen from the doorway as the
          WOMAN tenderly washes the BOY's hair - he is perhaps a year
          younger than at the start of the film - she appears lost in
          the task, enjoying it, chatting away to the BOY, momentarily
          unburdened. She sticks a finger in the BOY's ears, giving
          them a good soaping, which he likes.

          WOMAN.
          You could grow potatoes in these
          ears... 

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

           END FLASHBACK - now the MAN is in the tub, also scrawny and 
          filthy, lost in thought as he soaps up - the BOY helps. 

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY 

          The MAN trims his beard off with scissors in a mirror. He
          lathers up with shaving cream and starts to shave with a
          plastic safety razor. When the MAN is done he turns to the
          BOY, wiping away the foam.

          MAN.
          How do I look?

          BOY.
          Weird. Won't you be cold? 

          INT. BATHROOM, TOWN HOUSE - DAY

          Now the MAN is cutting the BOY's hair with kitchen scissors
          and a plastic comb.

          66.

                         CONTINUED:
          The BOY has a towel around his shoulders and long locks of
          hair decorate it. The MAN finishes, takes the towel off,
          wipes the BOY's neck and face with a flannel, holds up a
          mirror for the BOY to see.

          BOY.
          I look funny.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING

          They sit on the bunk bed with a checkerboard between them
          sipping thick hot chocolate made with condensed milk from
          plastic mugs and concentrating on the board, their worn out,
          wet blue jeans drying on a drying rack in the back ground.
          They are both wearing new sweaters too big for them,
          plundered from the stores. The MAN watches the BOY fondly,
          absorbed in checkers.

          EXT. LAWN - NIGHT

          Heavy rain slashes down on the lawn, already pools of water
          are flooding the lawn.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - NIGHT

          A shiny new quart of whiskey is slipped from its paper liquor
          store bag and opened with a soft CRACK. The whiskey is poured
          into a glass with a satisfying GLUG.
          WIDER - another feast is laid out, ham and powdered mash
          potato and biscuits and gravy. The BOY is eating while the
          MAN pours a whiskey. The BOY stops eating to watch the MAN
          drink the whiskey. The MAN's eyes glaze as he sips the strong
          liquor, dizzy already. 

          BOY.
          Can I try some?

          MAN.
          No. You won't like it. Makes you
          feel funny.
          The BOY stares, curious, wanting it.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You think I come from another
          world, don't you? Filled with all
          these strange things you've never
          seen.

          BOY.
          Sort of.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          Well, I do I guess.

          EXT. LAWN - EVENING

          The MAN just stands in the middle of the lawn COUGHING his
          guts up in the dark rain - again the phlemy wet cough. He
          bends over, sweating, listening, knowing it's the sound of
          fluid on the lungs.
          As he listens he hears something above the rain - he keeps
          shifting position, as if hearing different sounds from
          different directions. Nevertheless he anxiously looks around,
          then goes to the porch and drags an old mattress over, across
          the dead grass to the hatch.
          He lays it half across the hatch, crawls through the
          remaining gap and hauls the mattress the rest of the way over
          the hatch, then pulls the hatch closed with the old mattress
          lying on top. It just looks like an old mattress lying on a
          lawn in the rain.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - DAWN

          The MAN listens to the PATTER of rain and hears another
          sound... something or someone RUSTLING around the mattress
          above. He hears the sound of the MATTRESS being DRAGGED off
          of the door. He hears SCRABBLING and SCRATCHING on the door
          and freezes, staring at the lock, waiting for the
          inevitable... He quietly picks up the revolver. He looks
          across and sees the BOY is now wide awake too, staring, wide-
          eyed.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          Shh.

          BOY (WHISPERS.)
          Maybe it's a dog.

          MAN (WHISPERS.)
          It's not a dog.

          BOY. (BARELY MANAGING TO WHISPER.)
          It is! It's a dog! A dog!
          The MAN listens anxiously as the pawing and scratching
          continues, the wood over the bunker amplifying the noise. He
          cocks the revolver and positions himself under the hatch,
          ready.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          If it's a dog it'll be with
          someone.

          BOY.
          Who?

          MAN.
          I don't know.
          After a torturous moment the sounds die away.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          I'm not waiting to find out. Come
          on. Let's get out of here.

          BOY.
          I don't want to go.

          MAN.
          I know but it's not safe anymore.
          The MAN grabs his gun and cocks it, rushes about turning out
          all the lamps, and they sit anxiously in the darkness. 

          EXT. LAWN - MORNING 

          LATER - it's now lighter outside, the mattress lifts as the
          MAN opens the trap door and very carefully peeps out. He
          looks around, all angles, checking the coast is clear, then
          shuts the hatch again.

          INT. BUNKER - (CAMP 12) - MORNING 

           The MAN starts loading cans and packets into a carton. He 
           gathers a couple of large jerry cans of water. The BOY helps. 

          BOY.
          What are we going to do with all
          this stuff?

          MAN.
          We'll just have to take what we
          can.

          BOY.
          I wish we could live here. And we
          could keep the dog and the dog
          could catch food for us.

          MAN.
          Look, there is no dog, okay? I'm
          sorry but there just isn't.

          BOY.
          Well what is it!

          MAN.
          I don't know what it is!

          BOY.
          Please Papa.

          MAN.
          No.

          BOY.
          Just say it's going to be all
          right, Papa. Say it. Just say it,
          please.
          The MAN doesn't know what to say, losing patience.

          MAN.
          Listen, trouble comes when you
          least expect it. So maybe the thing
          to do is to just always expect it.

          BOY.
          Do you always expect it? Papa?

          MAN.
          I do, yes.

          BOY.
          You always think bad things are
          going to happen but we found this
          place. Maybe we'll find another
          place like this at the coast.

          MAN.
          Maybe.
          The MAN dumps the carton of food on the floor and packs
          another, organising jerry cans of water.

          EXT. LAWN - MORNING

          The INDUSTRIAL TROLLEY is loaded up and tied with a grey
          tarp.

          What are you doing?

          MAN.
          We'll have to cover our tracks from 
          now on.
          The MAN drags the old mattress back over the entrance to the 
          bunker. He carefully covers the surrounding area with debris. 

          EXT. RIVER - DAY

          The MAN pulls the new trolley across a bridge, stagnant black
          water underneath, the trolley is now laden with jerry cans of
          fresh water and cartons containing as many tins of food and
          supplies as they could manage. The BOY trails along behind.
          They are a strange sight, clean clothed, clean shaven, short
          haired, in their new jumpers - and now both wearing new
          surgical masks which they raise off their faces to speak.
          The MAN keeps checking behind him. 
          POV MAN - he sees the glint of glass, perhaps a pair of 
          BINOCULARS watching them.
          The BOY watches anxiously as the MAN gets out his own
          BINOCULARS and looks through them.
          POV MAN - a mysterious winking glint of light which quickly
          disappears.
          POV - through a different pair of binoculars, a completely
          different POV, we see the MAN looking through his binoculars
          at us.

          MAN.
          I think they're following us.

          BOY.
          Who?

          MAN.
          I don't know.

          BOY.
          You think it's bad guys?

          MAN.
          Probably.

          BOY.
          What if it's good guys?

          MAN.
          I don't think we're likely to meet
          any good guys for a while. We have
          to be careful now. We've got food.

          EXT. BEND/THE ROAD - DAY

          As they round a bend in the road they see a hunched figure
          walking ahead of them. The MAN stops abruptly, gets out the
          binoculars and watches:
          POV MAN - a distant, hunched figure hobbling away from them.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          They come up behind an OLD MAN, hunched over, withered,
          silent as he hobbles ahead. He wears layers of torn clothing
          and his feet are wrapped in rags and cardboard tied with
          green twine. They slowly approach and the man stops, turns
          and watches them suspiciously as they draw level.

          OLD MAN.
          I don't have anything for you. You
          can look if you want. I got
          nothing.

          MAN.
          We're not robbers.
          The OLD MAN leans an ear forward, deaf.

          OLD MAN.
          What?

          MAN.
          I said we're not robbers.

          OLD MAN.
          What are you?

          MAN.
          We're just like you.

          OLD MAN.
          What are you following me for?

          MAN.
          We're not following you.

          BOY.
          We've got food we could give him.

          MAN.
          He's not getting any food.
          The OLD MAN looks away, avoiding their eyes.

          BOY.
          He's scared, Papa.

          MAN.
          Everybody's scared.

          BOY.
          Please Papa.

          MAN.

                         ALL RIGHT1
          The MAN eyes the road to the left and right, then draws his
          revolver.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          If this is an ambush, he goes
          first.
          He goes out to the trolley and rummages in it while the BOY
          and the OLD MAN stare at each other. The MAN comes back with
          a tin of fruit cocktail and a tin opener and opens it and
          hands it to the BOY. The BOY places the tin of fruit on the
          road in front of the OLD MAN.

          BOY.
          Take it. Here.
          The OLD MAN doesn't move.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          What about a spoon?

          MAN.
          He's not getting a spoon.
          The BOY urges him on, miming with his hands, as if feeding a
          raccoon.

          BOY.
          Eat it. It's good.
          The OLD MAN picks up the tin and his filthy long nails
          CLATTER on the tin as he tips it to his mouth, the juice
          running down his chin, his head jerking as he swallows.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Look, Papa. He's hungry.

          MAN.
          I see it. And I know what you're
          going to ask me. And the answer is
          No.

          BOY.
          What's the question?

          MAN.
          We can't keep him.
          They watch him eating painfully slowly. The OLD MAN finishes
          and sits down in the road holding the tin, staring at it, as
          if it might refill.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          When did you last eat?
          The OLD MAN just stares.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Do you want to eat with us?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't know. What do I have to do?

          MAN.
          Tell us where the world went.

          OLD MAN.
          What?

          MAN.
          You don't have to do anything. Can
          you walk okay?
          They help the OLD MAN off the road and hand him his cane but
          he pushes it away.

          OLD MAN.
          I can walk.
           They walk off the road towards the dead, blackened woods.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          As they leave the road the OLD MAN studies the BOY. The BOY
          goes to take his hand:

          BOY.
          He can't see.

          MAN.
          Don't.
          The trio walk into the woods.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          How old are you?

          OLD MAN.
          I'm ninety.

          MAN.
          Ninety my ass! Is that what you
          tell people? So they don't hurt
          you?

          OLD MAN.
          Uh-huh.

          MAN.
          Does it work?

          OLD MAN.
          Nope.

          MAN.
          What's your name?

          OLD MAN.
          Ely.

          MAN.
          Just "Ely?"

          OLD MAN.
          What's wrong with "Ely?"

          EXT. CLEARING/WOODS - (CAMP 14) - EVENING 

           There's a camp fire now. The OLD MAN sits wrapped in a quilt,
           eating with a spoon and-licking his plate clean. In the far 
           distance, the faint glow of fires. The orange light bounces 
          into the night sky eerily.

          MAN.
          How come you're still alive? What
          do you eat?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't know. People give you
          things.

          MAN.
          No they don't.

          OLD MAN.
          You did.

          MAN.
          I didn't. He did.
          The OLD MAN eyes the BOY, closely, half blind.

          OLD MAN.
          Are you a little boy?

          MAN.
          What does he look like?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't know. I can't see real
          good.

          MAN.
          Is that right? Can you see me?

          OLD MAN.
          No. But I can tell somebody's
          there.

          MAN (TO BOY.)
          Okay. You need to sleep. Come on.
          He gathers up the BOY and takes him a few feet away, settles
          him down in blankets while the OLD MAN stares into the fire.

          OLD MAN. 
          I had a little boy once. Gone... 
          all gone...

          that... leastways not with you I
          can't.
          When the MAN returns he has his gun which he surreptitiously
          places on the ground in full view of the OLD MAN.

          MAN.
          You can see that, right? Okay. Tell
          me now. You're not a shill for a
          pack of road agents?

          OLD MAN.
          I'm not anything. I'll go if you
          want me to. I can find the road.
          The MAN stares at the OLD MAN cynically but the OLD MAN just
          stares back blankly.

          OLD MAN. (CONT'D)
          I live like an animal. You don't
          want to know the things I've had to
          eat. When I saw that boy I thought
          I'd died and he was an angel. I
          never thought I'd see a child
          again. I never thought that would
          happen to me.

          MAN.
          He is an angel. To me he's a God.

          OLD MAN.
          Well I hope that's not true. To be
          on the road with the last surviving
          God would be a pretty frightening
          experience.

          MAN.
          Why do you say that?

          OLD MAN.
          Where men can't live, Gods can't
          either. The road gangs would tear
          you limb from limb, both of you.
          The low RUMBLE in the earth is heard again, an earthquake,
          this time in the distance. They listen a moment.

          OLD MAN. (CONT'D)
          I knew this was coming. This or
          something like it.

          There were warnings. People thought
          it was a con - I always believed in
          it.

          MAN.
          Did you try to get ready for it?

          OLD MAN.
          No. What would you do? Even if you
          knew what to do you wouldn't know
          what to do. Suppose you were the
          last man left alive?

          MAN.
          How would you know if you were the
          last man alive?

          OLD MAN.
          I don't guess you would know it.
          You'd just be it.

          MAN.
          Maybe God would know.

          OLD MAN.
          If there is a God up there he would
          have turned his back on us by now.
          Whoever made humanity will find no
          humanity here.
          The MAN pours hot water into mugs to make coffee, hands one
          to the OLD MAN. They drink.

          MAN.
          Do you ever wish you would die?

          OLD MAN.
          No. It's foolish to ask for
          luxuries in times like these.

          EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - (CAMP 14) - MORNING 

           The BOY and the OLD MAN are standing by the trolley. The MAN 
          is watching from further away. The OLD MAN is fitting another
          can of peaches the BOY has given him into his knapsack.

                         M
          You should thank him you know. I

          Maybe I should and maybe I

          you anything.
          The OLD MAN looks around, orientating himself, and goes,
          tapping his cane, without a glance back at the BOY or the
          MAN. The MAN gives the BOY a reproachful look and the BOY
          looks defiant for the first time, a new distance between
          them.

          BOY.
          He's going to die and you don't
          care.

          MAN.
          I care enough. Maybe when we're out
          of food you'll have more time to
          think about it.

          BOY.
          You always say watch out for bad
          guys but that old man wasn't a bad
          guy and you can't even tell
          anymore.

          INT. CHURCH - (CAMP 13) - DAWN 

          The MAN and the BOY are camped inside an old church, dusty,
          faded stained glass is the only colour, startling after all
          the monochrome. The MAN and BOY are wrapped up in blankets, a
          small fire going. The BOY is asleep but the MAN is awake,
          coughing. He sits up, still coughing. He gets up and walks
          outside, trying to stifle the coughing.

          INT. CHURCH - (CAMP 13) - DAWN

           He wanders into an antechamber, coughing uncontrollably, 
           falls to his knees in a shroud of morning mist flooding the 
           church - and coughs up a gob of something dark and nasty, 
           spits it into the misty ground. 
           POV MAN - the mist before him clears to reveal a spattering 
           of dark blood on the pale ash. He stares, shocked, knowing 
          what it signifies. 

          INT. CHURCH - (CAMP 13) - DAWN 

           The BOY opens his eyes, he hasn't been asleep, listening to 
           the MAN cough, worried. The MAN returns and eyes the worried

          What happened to me? 
          The BOY's face crinkles up, he starts to sob.
           The MAN coughs again and the BOY shoots out a hand, puts it 
          over the MAN's mouth to staunch the coughing. 

          MAN. (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          I tell him: When you dream about
          bad things happening it shows
          you're still fighting. You're still
          alive. It's when you start to dream
          about good things you should start
          to worry.

          They are trudging along the blacktop adjacent to a railway
          line. There is a SHOTGUN blast in the distance and the MAN 
          and the BOY stop and look around. The MAN checks behind him 
          instinctively.
          POV MAN - a thin spike of smoke from a campfire rising up in
          the woods behind. The BOY notices and looks behind.

          BOY.
          Do you think they're still
          following us?

          MAN.
          I think they've been following us
          for a long time.

          The MAN and the BOY are swaddled in blankets up amongst the
          rocks with a birds eye view of the road and a railway bridge
          they can see along the road and the dead trees for half a
          mile. The BOY is nodding off, his head lolling as the MAN
          keeps watch, increasingly paranoid. 

          EXT. BLUFFS, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE (CAMP 16) MORNING 

          As they come down from the bluffs, the MAN is staring into
          the dead woods where another thin stem of SMOKE is rising.

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          More smoke. I think we should take
          a look.

          I don't want to. Let's just keep
          going.

          and the BOY look around, disappointed. 

          EXT. DUNES/COAST ROAD, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAY 

          Open country now, completely blackened landscape under heavy 
          ash. They are stopped. The BOY unfolds the threadbare map on 
          the ground, a crayon in his hand.

          MAN.
          You know where we are?

          BOY.
          No.

          MAN.
          Where do you think?
          The BOY points to a place on the map.

           MAN. (CONT'D)
          More.

           BOY.
          Here?

          MAN.
          No. We're closer than you think.
          He takes the crayon and points on the map.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          This is us. This is all sea.

          BOY.
          Is it blue?

          MAN-.
          The sea? I don't know. It used to
          be.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN picks up a desiccated pine cone from the ground, and
          stares at it, hollow-eyed, hungry. He squeezes it and it
          crumbles to dust. He takes a few steps, sniffing the air.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Can you smell that?

          BOY.
          It smells different.

          MAN.
          Everything is going to be
          different.

          EXT. DUNES - DAY

          The landscape has changed, dead salt bush and sand at the
          side of the road and finally, as they come around a bend in
          the road: dead sea grass sloping up to sand dunes up ahead.
          They look at each other and head for the dunes excitedly. The
          MAN hides the trolley discretely, so the BOY doesn't see his
          concern, he takes their bags, tarps and blankets with them as
          they head off for the dunes.

          EXT. TOP OF SAND DUNE - DAY 

          POV BOY - Gray beach, lead gray sea and waves rolling in
          slowly with a distant ROAR. On the beach a tide mark of wet
          gray ashy sludge and a skirt of glistening bones, fish
          skeletons bleached white on the sand.
          They take their parka hoods down and just stand there staring
          at the beach, the wind HOWLING around them, dozens of 
          bleached WHALE and FISH BONES and SKELETONS OF HUMANS who 
          have made it this far only to die. The MAN looks at the BOY
          and sees the intense disappointment.

          MAN.
          I'm sorry it's not blue.

          EXT. DUNES/BEACH - DAY

           They sit on the beach wrapped in blankets staring at a 
          surreal wall of impenetrable smog not far beyond where the
          waves are breaking. The MAN eyes the silent BOY, buffeted by
          wind, wrapped in a blanket, staring at the empty ocean...
          there is nothing and nobody there. They keep staring out to
          sea, filled with disappointment. The BOY impassively surveys
          the wall of smog which is like an iron curtain.

          BOY.
          What's on the other side?

          MAN.
          Nothing.

          BOY.
          There must be something.

          MAN.
          Maybe there's a father and his
          little boy and they're sitting on
          the beach too.

          BOY.
          And they could be carrying the fire
          too?

          MAN.
          They could be, yes.
          The MAN sees the BOY's hopefulness reappearing and strokes
          his head, his heart breaking for him.

          EXT. WATER'S EDGE - DAY

          The MAN and the BOY stand with their shoes off, the black sea
          washes up the sand at their filthy, blistered feet.

          BOY.
          What are our long term goals?

          MAN.
          "What are our long term goals?"
          Where did you hear that?

          BOY.
          I don't know. You said it.

          MAN.
          When?

          BOY.
          A long time ago.

          MAN.
          When your mother was here?

          BOY.
          I guess.

          MAN.
          And what was the answer?

          BOY.
          I don't know.

          MAN.
          Well, I don't either.
          They stare at the water - charred, quotidian household
          objects rolling back and forth in the surf. 

          BOY.
          Can I go swimming?

          MAN.
          Swimming? You'll freeze your nuts
          off.

          BOY.
          I know.

          MAN.
          I don't want to have to come in
          after you.
          The BOY lets the blanket fall and strips out of his parka and
          clothes. He runs along the beach naked, skinny and white,
          leaping SCREAMING into the icy surf.
          The MAN watches until the BOY comes out of the water, gasping
          with cold, shuddering. He wraps the BOY in the blanket and
          dries him off.

          EXT. BEACH - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

          The BOY is wrapped in blankets by the fire as LIGHTNING
          flickers in the distance, illuminating the empty beach. The
          MAN drapes another blanket over them. He puts his arms around
          the BOY who is shivering and sweating, looking a little wild
          eyed, babbling a little.

          BOY.
          How many people do you think are
          still alive?

          MAN.
          In the world? I don't know. Not
          very many.

          BOY.
          There could be people alive
          someplace else. Besides on earth?

                         CONTINUED:

          MAN.
          I don't think so. They couldn't
          live any place else.

          BOY.
          Not even if they could get there?
          If they had a-a-a spaceship?

          MAN.
          No. It's unlikely.
          The BOY stares, shivering, thinking.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Are you all right? What is it?
          He cups his hand to the babbling BOY's forehead.

          BOY.
          I don't feel so good.
          The BOY bends away and vomits and the MAN helps, rubbing his
          back and wiping the BOY's mouth when he's done.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

          MAN.
          That's okay, you didn't do anything
          wrong.
          The MAN is very worried now.

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - LATER 

           The MAN covers the BOY in more blankets and constructs a 
           makeshift tent with the tarp as the rain falls all around. 

          MAN.
          It's okay. You're going to be okay.
          It'll pass.

          BOY.
          Don't leave me here, don't go away
          Papa. Not even for a minute.

          MAN.
          I won't go away. I'm right here.
          He sits holding the BOY tightly. He feels for the BOY's
          heart.

                         CONTINUED:
          He drops droplets of sugar water from a bowl into the BOY's
          mouth. As the BOY shuts his eyes and dozes he checks the
          pulse at his neck and wipes his mouth with the blanket.

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - NIGHT

          The BOY is sleeping fitfully across the MAN's lap - he is
          still awake, staring in horror as the BOY sweats and shakes
          in his sleep. He wipes the BOY's brow, looks up-to the

                         HEAVENS:

          MAN.
          Oh no. No no. Not this. Jesus
          Christ what have you done to us?
          What have you done?

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - MORNING 

          The BOY is fast asleep, motionless but for stertorous
          breathing through his mouth. The MAN lies beside him, just
          staring at him, watching him sleep. The BOY opens his eyes
          and focuses weakly.

          BOY.
          Hi Papa.

          MAN.
          I'm right here.

          BOY.
          I know.
          The BOY shuts his eyes and goes back to sleep. The MAN
          strokes the BOY's hair tenderly, takes the pistol from his
          belt and carefully hides the pistol under the blanket by the 
          boy's side. He stands, takes one last look and walks away... 

          EXT. SPIT/WATER - DAWN

          The MAN is alone now, staring at the hull of a wrecked boat
          keeled over in ten feet of gray water a few yards out from
          the spit - a sixty footer, twin masts. Closer to shore, in
          the shallows between the boat and the sand is a grey,
          lifeless form. The man steps closer and sees:
          POV MAN - bobbing about in the tide, the bloated, rotting
          cadaver of a giant squid, eyes like dinner plates,
          translucent grey skin like an old light bulb.
          The MAN eyes it uneasily, then starts stripping off his
          clothes. He stares anxiously into the darkly roiling water
          near the boat.

          He looks back along the beach to the distant figure of the
          BOY, sitting up wrapped in his blankets, looking around,
          confused and scared, enough to make the MAN wince. He
          collects himself and wades cautiously into the gray soupy
          water. He takes a breath and starts swimming to the boat.

          EXT. SAND DUNE - (CAMP 16) - DAY

           The BOY is confused as he watches:
           POV BOY - the MAN swimming away.

           MYSTERY POV - over the shoulder of a mystery third person, 
           camera pushes in slightly on the BOY sleeping. 

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

           A FIGURE's feet enters the scene behind the boy, carefully 
           walks in close around the boy. The FIGURE's long KNIFE drops 
           into the scene, held at the figure's side. 
           The BOY senses the FIGURE and wakes up to see: 
           POV BOY - a dark, hunched FIGURE standing over him. 
           The BOY looks up at the FACE and, whatever it is, he's 
          terrified. 
           The BOY SHRIEKS, terrified, scrambling away, tripping over 
           pots and pans by the fire, he gets to his feet and runs. 

          EXT. SHORELINE - EVENING 

           The MAN struggles from the water and scans the beach, no sign 
           of the BOY. He dumps a medical kit and flare pistol he's 
           found on the boat and heads for the sand dunes. 

          EXT. SAND DUNES - (CAMP 16) - EVENING 

           The MAN runs over the sand and reaches the spot where he left 
           the BOY, the blue tarp blowing away across the beach, the 
           campsite and campfire disturbed. He runs up the dunes. 

          EXT. BEACH - EVENING 

           POV BOY - as he looks back he glimpses ragged FEET rushing 
           through the sand after him, a pair of hands reaching out...

          POV MAN - he catches up with the BOY, grabs his shoulder with
          one hand and the gun with the other.
           REVERSE ANGLE - the BOY sees it's the MAN and stops, stares, 
           still frightened, feverish, wild-eyed, confused. 

           MAN. 
           It's okay - 

           BOY. 
           A man! There was a man! I saw a

          in despair.

           What's wrong? 

           BOY.

           and we'll find them. You'll see.
           The BOY just shuts his eyes and slumps onto the sand in 
           despair. The MAN eyes him anxiously. 

           MAN. (CONT'D) 
           Please. Listen to me. Don't lose 
           heart. 
           The MAN seizes the FLARE GUN, takes it from its case 
           hurriedly, loads it with shells - the BOY now watches, wide- 
          eyed. 
          The MAN rushes a few paces up the DUNE and looks over to
          where the trolley was hidden - he fires a FLARE into the air.
          The FLARE arcs up into the murk with a long WHOOSH and breaks
          in a cloud of light, hanging there, hot tendrils of magnesium
          drifting down to the sand. The BOY watches, curious despite
          his despair.
          The MAN strains his eyes to see: the dunes bathed in pink
          light from the flare and the sand pock-marked with the
          footprints of the STRANGE MAN in a trail leading to the spot
          where the trolley. The trolley marks trail off into the
          distance.

           MAN and BOY bathed in the light of the flare. 
           CAMERA pushes in on the FACE watching them - bearded and 
           scarred with a wandering eye and a crushed cheekbone, a 
          veteran of many skirmishes.

          On the road in the middle of a desolate landscape, the light
          is dying, the strange lattice of lightning flickering across
          the sky, the MAN and the BOY are barefoot on the tarmac.
          POV MAN - way up ahead is the hunched FIGURE seen earlier -
          the THIEF, his back to us, trundling the loaded trolley along
          the road.

          MAN.
          Come on.
          They take off after the thief, bare feet thudding on the
          tarmac, the MAN in front, the BOY trailing, trying to catch
          up. The THIEF looks back at them and speeds up, head bent
          down over the handle running for his life. When he looks back
          again the MAN has drawn his pistol and is aiming it directly
          at him.
          The THIEF stops the trolley, pulls a carving knife from his
          belt, and turns to face them, standing behind the trolley.
          His face is emaciated and twitchy, a mouth like a bombed
          grave yard - not the FACE of the man watching them in the
          sand dunes. The MAN trains his gun on him, stock still,
          holding the BOY's hand.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Get away from the cart and put the
          knife down.
          The MAN spits and brandishes the knife desperately, he's
          scrawny, sullen, bearded and filthy.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          If you don't put down the carving
          knife and get away from the godamn
          cart I'm going to blow your brains
          out.

          BOY.
          Papa?

          MAN.
          Be quiet.
          The MAN cocks the pistol and there's two loud CLICKS. 

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          God damn you.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         CONTINUED:

          BOY.
          Papa please don't kill the man.

          THIEF.
          Come on man, I done what you said,
          listen to the boy.
          The BOY starts crying - the THIEF looks at the BOY and then
          the angry MAN, this seems to be sobering. He puts the knife
          in the trolley and steps away, hands in the air, his thumbs
          are missing.

          MAN.
          How long have you been following
          us?

          THIEF.
          I wasn't following you. I saw the
          cart on the sand an' I just took
          it.

          BOY.
          Please Papa.

          MAN.
          Take your clothes off. Take them
          off, every godamn stitch.

          THIEF.
          Come on man, don't do this.

          MAN.
          I'll kill you where you stand.

          THIEF.
          Don't do this, man.

          MAN.
          I won't tell you again.

          THIEF.
          All right, all right, just take it
          easy.
          The THIEF looks at the BOY who is now covering his ears and
          the MAN takes an intimidating step closer with the gun.
          The THIEF starts stripping and piling his rags in the road.

          MAN.

          MAN.
          The shoes.
          He sits naked in the road and unlaces the rotting shoes.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Put them in the cart.
          The THIEF stands and drops the shoes in the trolley.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Put the clothes in.
          The MAN drops the clothes in and stands there covering
          himself, shivering.

          THIEF.
          Don't do me like this, man. You 
          don't need to do me like this. 

          MAN.
          You didn't mind doing it to us.

          THIEF.
          I'm begging you.

          BOY.
          Papa.

          THIEF.
          Come on, listen to the kid.

          MAN.
          You tried to kill us.

          THIEF.
          I'm starving man. You'd have done
          the same.

          MAN.
          You took everything.

          THIEF.
          I'll die out here.

          MAN.
          I'm going to leave you the way you
          left us.

          The MAN grabs the trolley by the handle, pulls it around,
          puts the pistol on top and holds his hand out for the BOY.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Let's go.
          The BOY doesn't take his hand but they set off along the
          blacktop, the BOY snivelling and crying, leaving the THIEF
          shivering and whimpering.

          BOY.
          Oh papa.

          MAN.
          Stop it.

          BOY.
          I can't stop it.

          MAN.
          What do you think would have
          happened to him if we hadn't caught
          him? You've got to learn.

          BOY.
          I don't want to learn!

          MAN.
          I won't be here forever. Sooner or
          later you'll have to look after
          yourself.
          The BOY just looks at him - and keeps crying.

          EXT. ROAD/COAST, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - EVENING 

          Some distance away the BOY looks back at the THIEF, still
          crying.

          MAN.
          You have to stop crying.

          BOY.
          I can't.
          The BOY looks back one last time as the THIEF disappears from
          view - still just standing there, utterly lost.
          The MAN stops and puts his shoes on. He walks back up the
          road to the bend but the THIEF has gone.

          He's gone. Come on.

          BOY.
          He's not gone. He's not.
          The MAN looks helplessly at the tearful BOY as he fits his
          shoes on for him, the tears streaking the soot on his face.

          MAN.
          What do you want to do?

          BOY.
          Just help him, Papa. Just help him.
          The MAN looks back down the road, weighing it up.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          He was just hungry Papa. He's going
          to die.

          MAN.
          He's going to die anyway.

          BOY.
          He's so scared.

          MAN.
          I'm scared. Do you understand? I'm
          scared.
          The MAN tries to look the BOY in the eye but he keeps his
          head bowed, sobbing.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You're not the one who has to worry
          about everything.
          The BOY mumbles, tearful and snotty.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          What? What did you say?

          BOY.
          Yes I am. I am the one.
          The MAN stops and faces-the innocent BOY angrily, stares,
          then relenting, summons all his strength, turns the trolley
          around and they start wheeling it back the way they came.

          MAN.
          All right. Help me.

          The MAN takes the BOY's hand and puts it on the trolley
          handle. 

          EXT. ROAD/COAST, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 

          As the light fades to darkness they look for the THIEF to 
          give him his clothes back and call out "Hallo!" Etc. After a
          moment they stop.

          BOY.
          He's afraid to answer.

          MAN.
          Is this where we stopped?

          BOY.
          I don't know. I think so.
          They keep walking, hands cupped to mouths, hallooing
          mindlessly. The MAN stops to rest and watches the BOY a
          moment, he has stopped crying as he calls out for the thief.
          Finally the MAN piles the THIEF's shoes and clothes in the
          road. He puts a rock on top of them.

          MAN.
          Come on. We have to go.
          The BOY eyes the clothes sadly, silent now.

          EXT. ROADSIDE DUNES, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 

          They find a spot to stop and sit, exhausted. The MAN opens
          the first aid kit he took from the boat, selects various
          pills, crushes them up, pours a cup of water from a ferry can
          in the trolley, and hands them to the BOY.

          BOY. 
          I don't want it. 

          MAN. 
          I have to get your temperature 
          down. 
          The BOY swallows the pills and the water, shivering. 

          BOY-. 
          Can I ask you something? 

          MAN. 
          Of course you can.

          BOY. 
          What would you do if I died? 

          MAN. 
          If you died I'd want to die too. 

          BOY. 
          So you could be with me? 

          MAN. 
          So I could be with you, yes. But 
          that's not going to happen. 
          They look at each other a moment, unsure, the BOY shivering
          and sick-looking. The BOY lies down and shuts his eyes. The
          MAN puts a blanket over him. The MAN walks away a few paces
          and coughs endlessly, a nagging cough that won't go.

          EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

          THE MAN'S DREAM - a dream and a memory of an early summer
          day, the MAN and the WOMAN are in an orchard, lying in the 
          sun on a picnic blanket, an array of food, bread, fruit and
          wine beside them. The MAN lies back and the WOMAN cradles his 
          head in her lap, stroking his brow. She brings her face down
          and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids, then
          on each of his lips.
          POV MAN - the WOMAN's face, smiling a dazzling, radiant 
          smile, framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves
          and blossom and petals against the sky - to him she is
          angelic. Then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too -
          their ritual caress.

          END OF DREAM SEQUENCE.

          EXT. ROADSIDE DUNES, BLACKENED LANDSCAPE - DAWN 

          The MAN awakes distressed, he wipes a tear, blinks in
          confusion. 
          POV MAN - the BOY is kneeling beside him, watching him 
          calmly, no longer sweating and shivering, recovered. 

          BOY. 
          Papa? 
          The MAN rouses himself, sits up and just stares at the BOY, 
          amazed, as if he has arisen from the grave 

          MAN.
          How are you feeling?

           Are you hungry? 

           BOY. 
           Just thirsty. 
           The MAN gets up and fetches water from a ferry can in the 
           trolley, pours a cup, hands it to the BOY who drinks 
           thirstily. The MAN reaches out and strokes the BOY's hair as 
          he drinks. 

          EXT. RESORT TOWN, OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           The MAN and the BOY head towards a seaside town off in the 
          distance. 

          EXT. RESORT TOWN - DAY

          They enter a small beach resort with a faded "Welcome" sign 
          across the road, the BOY holding the MAN's hand now.

          EXT. RESORT TOWN/WATER'S EDGE - DAY

          They are down by the water. Small pleasure boats are half
          sunken in the grey water. Faded colored bunting and painted
          signs advertise ICE CREAMS, FOOD and a FUN FAIR. The BOY
          helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they 
          can go no further, they stop and drop onto the sand,
          exhausted.

          BOY.
          Can I tell you something?

          MAN.
          Yes.

          BOY.
          You tell me I shouldn't cry but
          I've heard you crying. I hear you
          coughing and crying to yourself in
          the night when you think I'm
          asleep.

          MAN.
          What of it?

          BOY.
          So if I shouldn't cry you shouldn't
          cry either.

          They look at each other.

          EXT. PORT - LATE AFTERNOON

          On the port side of town the MAN wheels the trolley through
          the deserted docks past rotten piers, a row of empty wooden
          warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed up. He is COUGHING
          and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls. The BOY is
          trailing a few paces behind, they're not speaking now.

          EXT. BACK STREET - EVENING

          As they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the MAN
          slows down to let the BOY catch up. But the BOY is now
          studying the ground intently. He bends down and picks up:
          POV BOY - an old cardboard match box, it's decals faded. He
          pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved
          Beetle. 

          BOY.
          What is it?

          MAN.
          It's a Beetle. 
          Suddenly the beetle twitches, then activates its wings and
          flies out of the box with a BUZZ and upwards into the sky...
          The BOY and the MAN stare up at the flying creature, amazed

                         AND:
          Without warning something WHISTLES over their heads very
          close and hits the wall beside them with a loud CLATTER. The
          MAN lunges at the BOY, landing on top of him to cover him and
          tries to grab the trolley which tips over, spilling 
          everything out.
          The MAN desperately tries to take cover while he looks over
          his shoulder and sees:
          POV MAN - in the upper window of a warehouse a man is drawing
          a bow and arrow aimed right at them.
          In desperation the MAN covers the BOY and tries to scrabble
          away but there's a DULL TWANG of bowstring and an arrow THUDS
          into his leg.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          Oh you bastard! You bastard!

                         CONTINUED:
          The MAN claws the blankets from the upturned trolley aside 
          and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has fallen from
          his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of reach. He
          spots the flare gun and seizes it, resting it on the trolley 
          and aiming carefully at the empty window. When the lone
          ARCHER appears again he squeezes off a shot and the flare
          goes rocketing up towards the window in a firey arc, ablaze
          with color, clean through the window. They can hear the
          ARCHER SCREAMING inside and see the colored light still
          flaring from the window.

          BOY.
          Oh Papa!

          MAN.
          Stay just like you are.
          He gets up and runs limping across the street, the arrow 
          still embedded in his leg.

          INT. WOODEN STAIRS - EVENING

          He limps up the stairs of the old warehouse as quickly as he
          can, flare gun at the ready, arrow in his leg.

          INT. WAREHOUSE FLOOR - EVENING

          He bursts into the main room and trains the gun. At the far
          end a WOMAN is sitting with the prone form of the ARCHER. The
          floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still
          in flames.

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          You son of a bitch! 

          MAN.
          Who else is up here?

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          You fucking asshole! 
          The MAN looks down, his leg is bleeding heavily now and the
          arrow is still sticking out.

          MAN.
          Where's the bow?

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          I don't have it.

          MAN.
          Why are you following us?

          ARCHER'S WOMAN.
          We're not following anybody. You
          were following us!
          The MAN stares at the WOMAN, looking her up and down, she
          looks sick and thin and desperate. He looks at the ARCHER,
          lying there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt,
          still smoking. The WOMAN covers his face with the blanket and
          the MAN doesn't know what to say, ashamed. He goes.

          EXT. CAFE - DAY 

           POV - again from a distance, as if a third party is watching,
           we watch the BOY and the MAN hobble into a CAFE. 

          INT. CAFE - DAY 

          One wall of the CAFE is merely a pile of rubble, opening out
          to the sea. The opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush
          green woods. The MAN tries to pull the arrow out but just
          pulls the wooden stem out. He takes off his bloodied trousers
          and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the
          arrow head, made from a SPOON, buried inside.

          MAN.
          See if you can find the medical kit
          from the boat. Quickly.
          The BOY rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands it
          over. He stares as the MAN slowly extracts the spoon, wincing
          in agony. The MAN dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit
          and searches through the kit for a needle. He finds a suture
          needle in a sterile envelope, rips it open with his teeth
          and, using the light coming in through the parlour windows he
          threads some silk thread into the needle. He starts to suture
          up the wound, grimacing in pain as the BOY watches in
          silence, until eventually offering:

                         BOY
          Does it hurt?
          The MAN just looks at him in disbelief - beat.

          MAN. 
          Yes! It hurts!

          BOY.
          What does it feel like?
          The MAN eyes the BOY, amazed at this inopportune chat. 

                         (CONTINUED)

          MAN.
          At least you're talking to me now.

          INT./EXT. CAFE - (CAMP 17) - NIGHT 

           They have a campfire in the cafe by the jetty and sit 
           overlooking the bay, through the missing wall, silent until: 

          MAN.
          Do you want me to tell you a story?

          BOY.
          No.

          MAN.
          Why not?

          BOY.
          Your stories aren't true.

          MAN.
          They don't have to be true. They're
          stories.

          BOY.
          In the stories we're always helping
          people. But we don't help people.
          We just shoot people. And in the
          stories good things happen but we
          just get sick.
          The MAN thinks about it - stuck for an answer. 

          MAN.
          We're still here aren't we? Doesn't
          that mean anything?

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH - DAY 

          The MAN pulls the trolley slowly, finding it a great effort.
          The BOY helps pull, eying the MAN with concern. The MAN stops
          and rests on the trolley and the BOY pulls on a few more feet
          then stops and looks back as the MAN COUGHS for a long
          painful moment. He takes the bloodstained surgical mask from
          his face, his breath foggy in the cold, he wrings out the
          blood and saliva, puts his head between his knees and coughs
          until he can cough no more, gasping for breathe, bloody drool
          unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine
          while the BOY watches, weeping silently.

          MAN.
          We have to leave the cart. I can't
          push it anymore.

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH - DAY

          They are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach
          road, the beach below, the BOY carrying a small-suitcase now,
          the MAN carrying sacks and bags. They stop and the MAN leans,
          impossibly breathless, his lungs packing up. They stop at the
          water edge, where the road reaches the sea.
          The BOY takes his hand gently.

          BOY.
          What are we going to do Papa?
          The MAN can't answer for breathlessness.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Well, what are we?
          The MAN sits heavily on the ground, totters as the BOY stands 
          watching him, eyes welling with tears.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          Oh no, Papa.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES -(CAMP 18) - DAY 

          The MAN is drifting in and out of consciousness in the sand.
          The BOY comes over with a cup of water and holds it to the
          MAN's lips, he drinks. The BOY has also lit a fire. He
          spreads out blankets.

          MAN.
          Don't get comfortable. You need to
          keep going. You don't know what
          might be down the road.

          BOY.
          No.

          MAN.
          We were always lucky. You'll be
          lucky again. You'll see. Just go.

          BOY.
          No. I can't.

          It's all right. This has been a
          long time coming. Just keep going
          south. Do everything the way we did
          it.

          BOY.
          No. You're going to be okay Papa.
          You have to.

          MAN.
          Keep the gun with you at all times.
          Don't let anyone take it from you.
          You need to find the good guys but
          you can't take any chances. Do you
          hear me?

          BOY.
          I want to be with you.

          MAN.
          I want to be with you too but I
          can't.

          BOY.
          Please.

          MAN.
          You have to go off on your own now.
          You have to carry the fire.

          BOY.
          I don't know how to.

          MAN.
          Yes you do. You know everything

          It's inside you. It was always

          The BOY stares at him, not sure what to believe.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          You have to let me go.

          BOY.
          Just take me with you please.
          Please, Papa! What should I do?

          MAN.
          Just hold my hand.
          The BOY grips the MAN's hand, bouncing up and down, agitated.

          BOY.
          You said you wouldn't ever leave
          me.

          MAN.
          I know. I'm sorry.
          The BOY falls on the MAN, hugging him tight, face pressed to
          his chest, sobbing.

          MAN. (CONT'D)
          My boy. You have my whole heart.
          You always did. You're the best

          The MAN closes his eyes and takes deep, rattling breaths.

          BOY.
          It's okay Papa. You don't have to
          talk anymore.
          Camera pulls back and the BOY is sitting with the MAN saying
          nothing. It's starting to grow dark. The BOY crouches down on
          the MAN's chest and goes to sleep there, rising and falling
          with his father's breathing.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES (CAMP 18) - NIGHT

          Darkness all around, the BOY is lying across the MAN, his
          hand rising and falling on the MAN's chest slowly,
          irregularly as the MAN's breath rattles in his lungs.

          EXT. CAR/BEACH - DAWN 

          FLASHBACK - or the MAN'S last ever dream: The MAN and the
          WOMAN snooze in the car - an ordinary young couple nestled
          together in the early morning sun light. The MAN wakes and
          looks at his sleeping wife, smooths her hair tenderly, very
          much in love, as she sleeps.
           His hand on her wakes her, she looks at him surprised and 
          pleased, smiles. 

           WOMAN.
           Hello...
           She kisses him and they look at the blue ocean and the white 
           sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm around him. 

           MAN. (V.O.)
           If I were God I would have made the
           world just so and no different...
           And so I have you. .I have you.

          END OF FLASHBACK. 

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) MORNING 

          The BOY is awake but doesn't move, his hand still on the
          MAN's chest, now motionless. He looks at the MAN who is cold
          and stiff now, long dead. The BOY gets up and holds the MAN's
          cold stiff hand. Tears course down his face silently.

          BOY.
          Oh Papa. Papa. Papa...

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) NIGHT

          The BOY is building a campfire. He lights it and sits there
          watching the MAN's motionless body.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES -(CAMP 19) MORNING 

          The BOY has slept beside the MAN, he wakes, blinks,
          bewildered.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) - DAY 

          The BOY is zipping up the MAN's parka carefully and heaping
          blankets on top, talking all the while.

          BOY.
          Can I tell you something? I had a
          bad dream. I had this penguin that
          you wound up and it would waddle
          and flap its flippers. And we were
          in that house we used to live in
          and it came around the corner but
          nobody had wound it up and it was
          really scary because-because-
          because...
          He goes quiet as he finishes tending to the body and puts his
          own parka on, zips it up.

          BOY. (CONT'D)
          The winder wasn't turning.
           He takes the gun, checks the magazine, shuts it and stands, 
          shoving the pistol in his belt.

          EXT. WATER'S EDGE, BOAT LAUNCH - DAY 

          The BOY is standing at the water's edge looking out at the
          smog and the emptiness. Out of nowhere a man in a gray and
          red ski parka with the hood up appears carrying a shotgun
          over his shoulder and a belt of shells.
          He goes over to the BOY, he is the same bearded and scarred 
          man seen earlier, watching them in the sand dunes. The BOY 
          doesn't flinch, but his hand goes to the gun at his side.
          When the man speaks he has some sort of speech defect,
          possibly caused by missing teeth.

          VETERAN.
          Where's the man you were with? (NO
          REPLY.) Was he your father?

          I'm sorry.

          BOY.
          I don't know what to do.

          VETERAN.
          Well, I think maybe you should come
          with me.
          The BOY's finger tightens on the trigger of the GUN.

          BOY.
          Are you one of the good guys?

          VETERAN.
          Yeah. I'm one of the good guys. Why
          don't you put that pistol away?

          BOY.
          I'm not supposed to let anybody
          take the pistol. No matter what.

          VETERAN.
          I don't want your pistol. I just
          didn't want you pointing it at me.
          The BOY lowers the gun to his side and the VETERAN comes a
          few steps closer, causing the BOY to back up a step.

          VETERAN. (CONT'D)
          Where's your stuff?

          BOY.
          I don't have much stuff.

          VETERAN.
          What have you got? Blankets?

          BOY.
          My Papa's wrapped in them.

          MAN.
          Show me.
          The BOY doesn't move. The MAN holds out his hand for the BOY
          to take, the BOY sees he has a THUMB MISSING and hesitates,
          wary. The MAN squats, leaning on his shotgun.

          Look. You got two choices here. You

          can go with me. If you stay you
          need to keep off the road.

          BOY.
          How do I know you're one of the
          good guys?

          VETERAN.
          You don't. You'll have to take a
          shot.
          The BOY weighs it up, eyeing the VETERAN.

          BOY.
          Do you have any kids?

          VETERAN.
          Yes we do.

          BOY.
          Do you have a little boy?

          VETERAN.
          We have a little boy and a little

          BOY.
          How old is he?

          He's about your age. Maybe a little
          older.

          VETERAN.
          Am I what?

          BOY.
          Carrying the fire.

          VETERAN.
          You're kind of weirded out, aren't
          you, kid?

          BOY.
          Well, are you?

          VETERAN.
          Yeah. I am. I'm carrying the fire.

          BOY.
          And I can go with you?

          VETERAN.
          Yes, you can.
          The BOY hesitates.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - DAY

          They go over to where the MAN lies dead and the VETERAN
          squats and lifts a blanket to take a look.

          VETERAN.
          Are these all the blankets you
          have?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          VETERAN.
          Is that your suitcase?

          BOY.
          Yes.
          The VETERAN stands and studies the BOY.

          VETERAN.
          Why don't you go up onto the road
          and wait for me. I'll bring the
          blankets.

          BOY.
          What about my Papa?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         CONTINUED:

          VETERAN.
          What about him?

          BOY.
          We can't just leave him here.

          VETERAN.
          Yes we can.

          BOY.
          I don't want people to see him.

          VETERAN.
          There's nobody to see him.

          BOY.
          Can I cover him in leaves?

          VETERAN.
          The wind will blow them away.

          BOY.
          Could we cover him with one of the
          blankets?

          VETERAN.
          Okay. I'll do it. Go on now.

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH, ROAD - DAY

          The BOY waits and in a moment the VETERAN emerges from the
          dunes carrying the suitcase with the blankets slung over his
          shoulder. He sorts through them and hands one to the BOY.

          VETERAN.
          Here. Wrap this around you. You're
          cold.
          The BOY eye the blanket uncertainly, holds out the pistol for
          the VETERAN to hold.

          VETERAN. (CONT'D)
          You hold onto that.

          BOY.
          Okay.

          VETERAN.
          Do you know how to shoot it?

          BOY.
          Yes.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         CONTINUED:

          VETERAN.
          Okay.

          BOY.
          What about my papa?

          VETERAN.
          There's nothing else to be done.

          BOY.
          I think I want to say goodbye to
          him.

          VETERAN.
          Will you be all right?

          BOY.
          Yes.

          VETERAN.
          Go ahead. I'll wait here for you.
          The BOY turns around and heads down to the beach.

          EXT. BEACH/DUNES - (CAMP 18) - DAY

          The BOY trudges through the sand over to the corpse of the
          MAN which is now neatly wrapped up in a blanket from head to
          toe. The BOY kneels beside him and starts to cry silently and
          whisper.

          BOY.
          I'll talk to you every day. And I
          won't forget. No matter what. No
          matter what, Papa.
          The BOY dries his eyes, takes a breath, gets up and walks
          back to the road...

          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH, ROAD- DAY 

          As the BOY walks out of the dunes holding the gun, a MOTHERLY
          WOMAN who is standing with the VETERAN comes towards him.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN.
          Oh. I am so glad to see you.
          The BOY just stares at her, bemused - a short distance away
          stands the rest of the family - a BOY his age and a GIRL. The
          BOY stares at the OTHER BOY and recognizes him - it's the
          same BOY he chased earlier.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         CONTINUED:
          Then the BOY notices a threadbare mongrel of a DOG, waiting
          with them.
          The MOTHERLY WOMAN goes over and puts her arms around him.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)
          We've been following you. Did you
          know that? We saw you with your
          Papa and we tried to catch up but
          you were too quick for us.

          VETERAN.
          There was some discussion about
          whether to even come after you at
          all.

          As she's chatting, the MOTHERLY WOMAN gently takes the gun
          from the BOY and hands it to the VETERAN.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN.
          We're so lucky. We were so worried
          about you. And now we don't have to
          worry about a thing.
          She kisses the BOY on the forehead and holds him at arm's
          length and looks at him.

          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)
          How does that sound? Is that okay?
          He stares but says nothing...

                      PRINCE OF THIEVES

FADE IN:

SUNSET
The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.

BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
their devotions.

EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET
Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.

INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET

A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic.
                         INTERROGATOR
           He says you stole his bread.
                         PETER
           It is a lie. I caught him
           stealing ours.
The lowlife jabbers some more.    The Interrogator debates.
                         INTERROGATOR
           Cut off the infidel's hand.
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                      2.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         No!... I took the bread.
                       PETER
         That's not true.
                       ROBIN
         They're not interested in truth.
         You are too weak, Peter. You
         would not live through it.
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
                       INTERROGATOR
         Sacrifice for the weaker? How
         noble... As you wish... Cut off
         this one's hand as well!... But
         first...
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.
                       INTERROGATOR
         Show them the courage of Allah.
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.
                       ROBIN
         And this is English courage.
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming.
                       PETER
         That's for five years of hell.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        3.
CONTINUED:
A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.
                         VOICE (O.S.)
         Behind you!
Warned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented.
                       ROBIN
         You speak English?
                       SARACEN
         The king's own. Set me free.
                         PETER
         No, Robin.
                       SARACEN
         For pity's sake. Mine is a
         sentence of death.
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.
                       PETER
         Don't trust him.
Two more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the
curved scimitar.
                       ROBIN
         What I would give for an English
         sword. This is a pruning hook.
A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.
                        ROBIN
         Hmm!   Not bad.
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
                       SARACEN
         Free me and I will show you a way
         out.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       4.
CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         Why should we trust you?
                       SARACEN
         If you don't, you are dead men.
                       ROBIN
         He makes a point.
The door bursts open.    More guards rush in.
                         ROBIN
         A good point.
He slashes the man free.

                         PETER
         Robin!
                       ROBIN
         Whatever blood is in his veins, he
         does not deserve to die here.
                         SARACEN
         This way!
He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a
tunnel.

INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
They wade through foul water up to their waists. The
Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
lops off its head.

                       SARACEN
         You are fast, my friend.
                       ROBIN
         Five years I've waited for the
         smell of free air. That makes a
         man fast.
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking
the way.
                       SARACEN
         You will need to be yet faster.
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                     5.
CONTINUED:
                        SARACEN
         Poison air.   Hold your breath.
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist.
                       PETER
                (coughing)
         Thanks. I misjudged you.
                       SARACEN
         Save your breath.

Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works.
                       SARACEN
         Allah be praised.
                       ROBIN
         Amen, brother.
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating.

EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT
Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.
                       ROBIN
         God willing, we may now be safe.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     6.
CONTINUED:
Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
approaching.
                         ROBIN
         Come, Peter.    We must hurry.
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
                         PETER
         It is mortal.    Leave me.
                       ROBIN
         Hold on to my shoulder.

Peter shakes him off.
                       PETER
         My mother... my little sister.
         Tell them I love them. Tell them
         I died a free Englishman.
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.
                       SARACEN
         His wound is by the heart.    We
         cannot save him.
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
hand.
                       PETER
         Take this to my sister. Swear you
         will protect her for me... Swear
         it, Robin!
                       ROBIN
                (reluctantly)
         I swear it.
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
                         PETER
         For England.
He fells the first Arab.   The Saracen pulls Robin away.
                       SARACEN
         Come now! Do not fail your friend.
         Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.

                                                         7.
DESERTED ALLEY - LATER
Robin and the Saracen catch their breath.
                          ROBIN
            Farewell, friend. God speed you
            on your way.
                          SARACEN
            Our way is together. With the
            speed of Allah.
He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor.
                          ROBIN
            I go to England.

                          SARACEN
            Then I go to England.
                           ROBIN
            England?   Why?
                          SARACEN
            You saved my life. I must stay
            with you until I save yours.
                          ROBIN
            Go your own way. I relieve you of
            your obligation.
                          SARACEN
            Only Allah can do that.
                          ROBIN
            And if I don't want you?
                          SARACEN
            You have no choice... unless you
            think you can kill me.
He grins broadly.      Offers his hand.
                          SARACEN
            My name is Aslan.
Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.
                          ROBIN
            Robin of Locksley. You know a
            short route to England, Aslan?

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)
Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.
SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND

INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Enough of that din, Remus.    I
         can't think.
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
LOCKSLEY.
Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
desperate, KENNETH.
                        KENNETH
         My Lord!   Help me.
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
back.
                       DUNCAN
         You must wait... I am sorry you
         were disturbed, Master.
                       KENNETH
                (high anxiety)
         My Lord, please!
                       LOCKSLEY
         It is alright, Duncan.
                (to Kenneth)
         You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
The peasant falls to his knees.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                       KENNETH
         They've taken my Gwen.    My
         daughter.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Who has taken her?
                       KENNETH
         Men on horses. In masks.
                (touches his wound)
         We tried to stop them. My son is
         dead.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT

Steam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord
Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain
him.
                       DUNCAN
         You cannot go alone, Master.      Let
         me ride for help.
                       LOCKSLEY
         That may be too late. Kenneth,
         lead the way.
He kicks his horse into motion.
                         DUNCAN
         Master, stay!    There is an evil
         moon tonight.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Good will overcome, Duncan.      Trust
         in that.
Duncan looks up.    Crosses himself.    Dark clouds race
across the moon.

EXT. WOODED TRAIL
Kenneth checks the ground.    Locksley waits.
                       KENNETH
         They came this way, my Lord.
                         LOCKSLEY
         Onward then.    What is this place?
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                    10.

                       KENNETH
         Nearby the Gregor Caves.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.

                       LOCKSLEY
         Steady, man. They are to dissuade
         the faint of heart. Think of
         Gwen.
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.
                       KENNETH
         Druids.
                       LOCKSLEY
         I trusted we were rid of such evil
         a century ago.

An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic.
                       KENNETH
                (petrified)
         Is it the devil?
                       LOCKSLEY
         If it is, I have some Christian
         steel that will test his hide.
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
head.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      11.

                       LOCKSLEY
         Gwen?
Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.
                       DEMON
         Come, my virgin flower.
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.
                        DEMON
         Kill him!   Kill him!
The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right.
Reaches the altar stone.
                        LOCKSLEY
         Gwen!   Up, girl, up!
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.
                       LOCKSLEY
         In the name of God!
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                    12.
CONTINUED:
The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition.


                        LOCKSLEY
         Nottingham!
The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard,
cruel intensity in every feature.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You are an unwelcome surprise,
         Locksley.
                       LOCKSLEY
         The King shall hear of this,
         Nottingham.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         I think not.
Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their
faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.

                        LOCKSELY
         God help us.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         One day all England will worship
         with us.
                        LOCKSLEY
         Never.
The crone spits venom in his face.
                       DEMON
         I am Mortianna. You will die with
         my name on your lips.
Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill-
side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
masked figures block his way.

                                                         13.
EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY
A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross on
its sail.
A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.
                         ROBIN
         Home.    Thank you, Lord.
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
hand.

                       ROBIN
         My friend, you have escorted me
         home. I beg you to free yourself
         of your vow. Return with the
         boat. I know how heavy your
         heart must be, this far from your
         family and native land...
                       ASLAN (SARACEN)
         Because I love them so dearly,
         I cannot dishonor them.
A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.
                       ROBIN
         I thought you'd say that.
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.

                       ASLAN
         No man controls my destiny.
         Especially not one who attacks
         downwind and stinks of garlic.
Robin laughs.    The Saracen remains intense.
                       ASLAN
         If our positions were reversed,
         I would have done the same.
         Only I would have succeeded.
He smiles broadly.    Robin claps him on the shoulder.
                       ROBIN
         Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will
         celebrate your honor when we dine
         with my father.

                                                    14.
EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY
CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.
                       GISBORNE
         You owe the sheriff three bushels
         of flax.
                       FANNY
         You starve us. First the drought,
         now you take what food we have
         left.
                       GISBORNE
         For starving people, you look
         fat enough.
                       SOLDIER
                (emerging from
                 the hut)
         He's not here, sir. None but the
         woman and children.
                       GISBORNE
                (to Fanny)
         Where is your mate? The man
         they call Little.
                       FANNY
         He died last winter.
                       GISBORNE
         Is that so? We hear he     is very
         much alive. Hiding out     in the
         forest. He probably ran     away
         to escape your scolding    tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.
                         FANNY
         Norman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
Gisborne's throat.

                       FANNY
         No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
         make it worse.
Wulf backs off.   Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
                        GISBORNE
         Seize him!
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.
                       GISBORNE
         This is Lord Nottingham's deer.
         Is this how you repay the Sheriff
         for his protection?
                       WULF (BOY)
         Like a wolf protects sheep.
                        FANNY
         I killed it.   We needed the meat.
                       GISBORNE
         Poachers hang. Either he dies or
         you die.
                       WULF
         My mother lies to protect me.
                        FANNY
         No, Wulf!
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.

                       GISBORNE
         You have deprived us of a hunt,
         boy.
He cups his hand in the deer's blood.    Smears it on
Wulf's face.
                       GISBORNE
         The hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
                       GISBORNE
         Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us
         some pleasure before you die.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       16.
CONTINUED:
To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.
                         GISBORNE
         Unleash them!

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK
Nearing home, Robin is buoyant.     The Saracen, brooding,
walks two paces behind him.
                       ROBIN
         Why must you walk in back of me?

                       ASLAN
         In your land am I not the infidel?
         The unbeliever, the instrument of
         evil?
                       ROBIN
         Our races have fought for a
         hundred years to prove that point.
                       ASLAN
         Then I trust it is safer to appear
         as your slave than as your equal.
                       ROBIN
         For an 'infidel' you have uncommon
         clarity of thinking. Yet you
         refuse to tell me about your home
         and family.
                       ASLAN
         Those are my burdens.

                       ROBIN
         You speak my language. You have
         the diplomacy and honor code of
         a nobleman. I ask again, why
         were you to be executed?
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
                       ROBIN
         So, I must continue with my
         guesswork. You are highborn?
         Probably... You fell from favor...
         Clearly... Why? You broke the
         law? You were a rival for power?
         ... A woman?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        17.

The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
                          ROBIN
            By the Lord, that's it!
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
                          ROBIN
            They say there are Arab women of
            such beauty that they can possess
            a man's mind, that he would be
            willing to die for them. Is
            that not so?
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darkening
sky.
                          ASLAN
            It is close to sunset.
                          ROBIN
            Your people must marry women
            chosen for them by others, right?
No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
                          ROBIN
            Who is she? The Mullah's daughter?
            ... Another man's wife?... That's
            it!
                          ASLAN
            Endless clouds. Is there no sun
            in your cursed country?
                          ROBIN
            You dog! You painted old dog!
            What is her name?
                          ASLAN
            Which way is East?
                         ROBIN
            Her name?
                         ASLAN
            East?
                         ROBIN
            Her name?
                         ASLAN
            East?!!!
Robin folds his arms.    A standoff.

                       ASLAN
         Damn you!... Jasmina.
                         ROBIN
         Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful?
                       ASLAN
         Which way is East?
                         ROBIN
         That way.
Aslan throws his rug on the ground.    Kneels.
                         ASLAN
         Are you sure?
                       ROBIN
         I would know blindfolded. I'm
         five miles from home... Was she
         worth it?
                       ASLAN
         Worth dying for.
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
branches. A hound savages his leg.
The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.

                       GISBORNE
         You're not playing by    the rules,
         boy. Deer don't climb     trees...
         Perhaps he thinks he's    a game
         bird. Shall we teach     him to fly?
         Cut it down!
The soldiers hack at the trunk.    The tree quivers.
                       ROBIN
         Hold!... I am curious as to what
         manner of creature is so fearsome
         that it takes six men to attack
         it.
Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.

                       GISBORNE
         Stand back, stranger. This is no
         affair of yours.
                       ROBIN
         Have we treed the devil himself?
         Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.
         A truly dangerous animal.
                       GISBORNE
         I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
         This is the Sheriff's land.
                       ROBIN
         Wrong. This is my land, and my
         tree. Therefore, whatever is in
         it also belongs to me.
                       GISBORNE
         I grow dangerously tired of your
         wit... Chop it down!
                       ROBIN
         The man who strikes that tree
         dies.
He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
                       GISBORNE
         Chop down the hooded fool.
                       ROBIN
                (backing up)
         Perhaps we could discuss this.

The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds
through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
                       GISBORNE
         Kill him!
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!   It's time to redeem that
         vow.
                       GISBORNE
         Set the dogs on him!
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        20.
CONTINUED:
Aslan ignores him, lost in his   prayers. Robin lifts the
other arm -- a second concealed   crossbow. WHUMPF! The
bolt flips the dog handler into   the vicious pack. Dead
or not, he soon will be. Robin    unsheathes his sword.
                          ROBIN
            Aslan, get off your damn knees!
            I have four of them cornered.
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
flashing steel.
                          ROBIN
            I hope there's enough of me to
            satisfy you all.
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood flows
from his arm. His sword falls.
                         ROBIN
            Aslan!!
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin
freezes.
                          GISBORNE
            Well, hooded stranger, allow me
            to know your name before I run you
            through.

A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
pilgrim's hood.
                          GISBORNE
            Robin of Locksley!
                          ROBIN
            On your knees, Gisborne.   Pray.
He obeys.    Robin raises his sword.
                          GISBORNE
            Please, Locksley! No!
Robin drives the point into Gisborne's rear.      The man
leaps.

                       ROBIN
         Now get off my land. And tell your
         cousin the Sheriff what happens to
         his scum when they pick on my
         people.
Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his
rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab.
Keeps running.
                       ROBIN
                (to Aslan,
                 furious)
         You worthless savage! You travel
         ten thousand miles to save my life,
         then leave me to be butchered.
                       ASLAN
         I will fulfill my vow when I
         choose.
                       ROBIN
         Which does not include prayer
         times, meal times, or any time
         I'm outnumbered six to one!!
                       ASLAN
         You whine like a mule.   You are
         still alive.
                       ROBIN
         Barely.
Aslan examines Robin's wound.   Dismissive.
                       ASLAN
         A flesh wound. Why did you let
         their leader go?
                       ROBIN
         After six years of the stench of
         death, I have no stomach for
         needless blood on my hands.
Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
                       ROBIN
         Have no fear, boy.
The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering
a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
                       ASLAN
                (laughing)
         The conquering hero returns.

                        ROBIN
         Ha!   It was you he was scared of.
Aslan's humor is infectious.     Robin's anger relents.
                       ROBIN
         Come, my strange friend. Beyond
         that hill lies the prettiest
         little castle in all Christendom.
         Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
                       ASLAN
         With feather pillows?
                       ROBIN
         With feather pillows. Warm and
         soft like Jasmina's embrace.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT
Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud
castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted.
Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck
dumb with horror.
The dark courtyard.   Heartsick, Robin stumbles over
debris.
                         ROBIN
         Father!    Hello!
His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan
places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended
high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.


CLOSE - MEDALLION
round the corpse's neck.   The Locksley crest.
                        ROBIN
         Noooooo!
A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture.
Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained,
Aslan looks on.
                       ROBIN
         I should have been here.
Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they
hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A
hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff
... Duncan.

         Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you
         cut him down?
                       DUNCAN
         Master Robin, is it you? A
         miracle. I thought God had
         abandoned us.
                       ROBIN
         You left my father to hang like
         a common thief, carrion for the
         crows.

                       ASLAN
         Easy... Look at him.
Duncan steps into the moonlight.    His face crudely-
scarred.
                       ROBIN
         What has happened?
                       DUNCAN
         They say they captured him
         worshipping with the Druids. He
         signed a confession before the
         Bishop of Hereford.
                       ROBIN
         Did they have witnesses?
                       DUNCAN
         Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall.
         The Bishop decreed all the Locksley
         lands forfeit.
                       ROBIN
         Did you believe the charges?
                       DUNCAN
         Not even when they took my eyes.
                       ROBIN
         Who did this to you, Duncan?
                       DUNCAN
         Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff
         looking on.
Robin holds the old retainer to his chest.    Stares into
the night in silent rage.

                                                         24.
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
Marked contrast.   A forbidding fortress.   Cliff-like
battlements.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT
Face like thunder, Guy of Gisborne strides up curving,
stone steps. A long corridor leads to a guarded oak
door.
                       SENTRY
         Sir Guy. His Lordship is not to
         be disturbed.
                        GISBORNE
         Away, fool.
He shoves the Sentry aside.

EXT. CASTLE BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT
Torches illuminate Nottingham's face. Chilling cruelty
in Manson-like eyes. Seated, his manicured hand dis-
tractedly strokes a semi-naked girl. She sits at his
feet like a frightened dog. When Gisborne enters, she
covers up.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Who bade you cover up?
He smashes his fist into his chair.   She timidly
uncovers.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin, I trust you justify your
         intrusion with news of profound
         value.
His attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of
the courtyard. UNEARTHLY SOUNDS emanate from the black-
ness.
                       GISBORNE
         I met a hooded man today. He bade
         me warn you not to harm his
         people.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         His name?

         Ha! The prodigal son returns. He
         is a whelp. This girl could best
         him.
                       GISBORNE
         This whelp bested five of my men
         in the blink of an eye.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Your men were probably drunk.   Yet
         you survived, cousin?
Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a
child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud
CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW,
wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think
she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible
agility. MORTIANNA.
                       GISBORNE
                (stunned)
         You brought her here?
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Quiet!
The crone's fingers dart into a bag. Emerge with a
writhing, SQUEALING mass... a PIGLET. A knife flashes.
Blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter.
The girl flinches in horror. Mortianna shakes the con-
tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. Carved bone
dice -- Runes.
She rattles the platter. The rune symbols dance in
trails of blood. Eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses
out her incoherent visions. Nottingham follows her every
move. A connoisseur.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you see?
                       MORTIANNA
         Change the seat of power.

         London?
                       MORTIANNA
         Change it.

         Move the capitol to Nottingham?
         Excellent. How?

         That is not revealed.
The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind.      Mounting
intensity.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ally with royal blood. What else
         do you see?

         Armies.

         Whose?

         Yours. Men and weaponry in great

         And victory?
                       MORTIANNA
         Much blood will be spilled.

         Whose?


CLOSE SHOT
A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol.
Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands
again. Again the grinning skull.

BACK TO SCENE
The tray smashes to the ground.      The hag runs at
Gisborne.
                       MORTIANNA
         Who have you seen?!
She shakes him.    Screams spittle in his face.

         You lie!     A man... A painted man.

         What is wrong?
                       MORTIANNA

She whimpers.   Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.

         The painted man. He haunts my
         dreams.
                       GISBORNE
         Locksley has a companion. A dark-
         skinned foreigner. He had the
         marked skin of Islam.
Mortianna trembles like an epileptic.    Eyes wide with
terror.
                          MORTIANNA
         Kill them!     Kill them!
She throws herself at Nottingham for protection.    He
caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck.

         Cousin. Prove to Locksley that
         your survival was his last mistake.

                       MORTIANNA
                (frantic)
         And the painted man! Kill him.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Kill them both.
He continues to stroke her.    Her trembling subsides.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You have done well, Mortianna.
         Exceedingly well. No one shall
         harm you, I swear it.
Mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young
girl, who shrinks away. Nottingham gently takes the
girl's hand.

Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down
viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses
         will seem soft, like an angel's.
                (to Mortianna)
         Take her. You have earned her.
Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.   Drags her
away.
                       GISBORNE
         It is madness bringing the hag
         here.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For
         in madness, there is great power.

EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - DAWN
Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees.
Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave.
Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
                       ROBIN
         Our last words in this world were
         spoken in anger. He called the
         Crusades a foolish quest, said it
         was vanity to force other men to
         our religion. He was right.
                (looks to Aslan,
                 then back to the
                 grave)
         Please forgive me, Father.
                       DUNCAN
         He loved you till the end, young
         master. He never gave up hope of
         your return.
                       ROBIN
         I failed him. I should have been
         here at his side.
                       DUNCAN
         You must leave, head north to
         safety. Gisborne will surely seek
         revenge.
                       ROBIN
         Leave me.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                       DUNCAN
         I know what you're thinking. But
         one man can achieve nothing
         against so many. You would need
         an army.
                         ROBIN
         Leave me.
                         ASLAN
         Come, friend.
He leads the old man away.
                                           CUT TO:


GRAVE SIDE - LATER
Pouring rain. Robin stands drenched at the grave side.
Aslan watches from the shelter of trees. Duncan heats a
stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.
                       DUNCAN
         He still stands vigil?
                         ASLAN
         Like a rock.
Duncan offers half the bread to the Saracen.
                       DUNCAN
         A curse on the Saracens! Were it
         not for their ungodly ways, he
         would never have left. This would
         never have happened.

                       ASLAN
         It surprises me that one who
         curses others so readily has lived
         so long.
                       DUNCAN
         I do not recognize the style of
         your voice, friend. Are you
         Irish? A Cornishman?
                         ASLAN
         Er... no.
                       DUNCAN
         What manner of name is Aslan then?
                       ASLAN
         A fine Saracen name.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      30.
CONTINUED:
                         DUNCAN
         Lord, no!
He chokes in shock.   Spitting bread.
                       ASLAN
         Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I
         take no offense.
                (glances at Robin)
         By the prophet! What is the man
         doing?
Robin raises his dagger over his wrist.   Aslan runs to
him.

                         ASLAN
         Wait!
Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm.
Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave.
                       ROBIN
         I swear by my own blood. I will
         not rest until I have restored my
         father's name.
                (a whisper)
         ... Or until I am dead.

EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY
Ooze sucks at feet.   The three men stomp through mud and
rain.
                       ROBIN
         We make a fine army, do we not,
         Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and
         a fool.
                       ASLAN
         A fine, wet army. I have never
         witnessed a storm of such duration.
         When does summer come to this
         land?
                       ROBIN
         This is summer.
                       ASLAN
         Then Allah truly is great.
                         ROBIN
         Why, pray?

CONTINUED:
                         ASLAN
           No food, no shelter,   and weather
           that would curse the   end of the
           earth. We  will all   quickly be
           dead, and I shall be   rid of my
           vow.
They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched
mansion.
                         ROBIN
           You despair too soon, Aslan. We
           shall find food and shelter here
           among friends.

                         ASLAN
           What is this place?
                         ROBIN
           Peter's home. It is nearly seven
           years since we left here together.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
Robin pounds on the door.    A hatch opens.     An OLD WOMAN's
face.
                         OLD WOMAN
           No beggars!
The hatch slams shut.    Robin pounds again.
                         ROBIN
           Open up!

A pause.   The hatch slides back.
                         ROBIN
           Tell the mistress of the house
           that Robin of Locksley is at her
           door.
                         OLD WOMAN
           Her ladyship is not at home.
She slams the hatch again.    Robin jams in his hand.
                         ROBIN
           Aagh!
He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.

                          ROBIN
            Is the child Marian at home?
                          OLD WOMAN
            Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't.
            Remove that hand.
Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked
door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly
the hatch slams.
                          ASLAN
            The hospitality here is as warm as
            the weather.

They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack.
                          OLD WOMAN
            Leave your weapons.
The three start forward.       Her bony finger points at
Robin.
                            OLD WOMAN
            Just you.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
The hall. Deer heads.        Boar heads.   Portraits of
ancestors.
                            OLD WOMAN
            Wait here.
He waits.    CREAKING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony.

                            GIRL
            Who are you?
Dim lighting.    Robin cannot make out who it is.
                          ROBIN
            I am Robin of Locksley.
                             GIRL
            You lie.     Robin is dead.
                          ROBIN
            I may meet my maker soon from lack
            of sustenance. But for now I am
            real enough.

         By heaven, am I to dance next?
         Who are you?
                       GIRL
         I am the maid Marian.
                       ROBIN
         Then show yourself, child.     For we
         knew each other well.
                       GIRL
         With the king away, these are
         lawless times. There are outlaws
         villainous enough to kidnap and
         ransom a relative of his.
                       ROBIN
         You know I am not one of them.
         Besides, I am sworn to protect
         you.
                       GIRL
                (laughs)
         Protect me? Robin of Locksley was
         nothing but a spoiled bully.
                       ROBIN
         Allow that years of war and prison
         may change a man. Step forward,
         Marian, so I may see how you have
         changed.

She moves into the light... Fat.     Rotten teeth.   Ugly as
sin.
                       ROBIN
         Er... the years have been kind.
                       GIRL
         Thank you. Now remove yourself
         from this household.
A figure steps behind Robin.    Sticks a sword in his back.
                       GIRL
                (turning away)
         As you can see, we are already
         well protected.
                         ROBIN
         Wait, Marian!    ...ouch!

The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man
-- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
                        ROBIN
          You are truly courageous against
          an unarmed man.
The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps.
Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the
floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts,
drawing a dagger.
Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head.
Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.


OUTSIDE
The SOUND of the fight indoors.   Aslan hurls himself at
the door. It doesn't give.

INSIDE
Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts.     The
horns get shorter. Robin retreats.
Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at
the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the
dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops.
Robin wrenches off the mask.
Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.
The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just
in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's
crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young
woman stands over Robin.
                        YOUNG WOMAN
          As she was saying, we have
          no need of your protection.
Robin croaks through clenched teeth.

The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves.
Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin --
"Help!" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An
impish grin.
                       MARIAN
         I trust Lord Locksley has
         recovered from his indisposition.
Aslan laughs.   Robin glares.

EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through
clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in
her voice.
                       MARIAN
         Why would he wish me to be
         protected by the boy who burned
         my hair when I was a child?
                       ROBIN
         We were together five terrible
         years in a Saracen prison.
                       MARIAN
         How do I know you didn't abandon
         him there to save your own skin.
Robin hands her Peter's ring.   She is shocked.
                       ROBIN
         Marian, I'm sorry.

                       MARIAN
         I will forward your condolences
         to my mother.
She turns her back.   He searches for a way to reach her.
                       ROBIN
         On my return, I found my father
         dead. The Sheriff denounced him
         as a Druid and took our lands.
                       MARIAN
         The people fear the Druids so much
         they'd believe anything.
         Nottingham would have me burned at
         the stake as a witch if he thought
         he could possess my property.

         there.
                       MARIAN
         I will not retreat.     Besides, I
         have no interest in    life at court.
         Gossip-mongering and    currying
         favor. Here I am my     own person.
                       ROBIN
         The you must allow me to be your
         guardian.

                       MARIAN
         I do not need a guardian.
She turns to face him.   Streaming tears.
                       MARIAN
         My brother is dead. You cannot
         take his place.
Robin grabs and holds her.
                       ROBIN
         Marian, I don't want to replace
         him.
                       MARIAN
         What do you want?
Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin
moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away.

                       MARIAN
         This is wrong.
She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her.
Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan.
                       ASLAN
         Robin! The old man hears horses.
         Approaching fast.
He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
hillside.
                       ASLAN
         Twenty or more. In battle armor.
                       MARIAN
         Soldiers coming here?     Is this
         your protection?

         I killed some of the Sheriff's
         men. I fear I have placed you in
         danger.
                       MARIAN
         I can take care of myself. There
         are horses in the stable. Go!
Aslan runs into the stables.
                       ROBIN
         I'm not leaving.
Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two
bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by
Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the
soldiers.
                        MARIAN
         Stop them!   They're stealing my
         horses!
                       ROBIN
         Damn the girl! Aslan, can you
         ride?
In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a
single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs
in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the
estate wall.
                        ROBIN
         He can ride.
He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely
clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on.
Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
                       GISBORNE
         You have been sheltering outlaws,
         Lady Marian.
                       MARIAN
         They're thieves, you imbecile.
         Bring back my horses, or the
         Sheriff will know of your
         cowardice.
Gisborne knows she is lying.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                        38.
CONTINUED:
                       GISBORNE
         You're lucky he didn't steal your
         virtue too.
                (to his men)
         A crown to the man who brings me
         Locksley's head.
He leads the pursuit.   A SOLDIER hangs back.   Grabs
Marian's hair.
                       SOLDIER
         A kiss for me, Saxon bitch.
                        MARIAN
         Kiss this!

She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.    Jabs
the blade into his wrist.
                       MARIAN
         Try me again, if you want to
         leave a hand behind.
Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks
down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently.
                                           CUT TO:
EXT. STREAM
Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan
hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half
a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men.
Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the
steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the
drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It
backs away.
                       ROBIN
         Damn you, animal!
Aslan shouts from the far bank.
                       ASLAN
         Treat it like a woman.
Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing
in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of
BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or
die.
                       ASLAN
         Have you never had a woman?
         Gently, man. Soothe it!
                                           (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
                       ROBIN
         Of course I've had a woman!
         Come on, pretty one.
He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward.
                        ASLAN
         Softly.   With your knees.
                        ROBIN
         I know!   I know!
The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep
drop.

                         ROBIN
         Easy, easy.
Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the
frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch
down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin
enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
                         ROBIN
         I love you!
The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their
mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
                       GISBORNE
                (yelling)
         Robin of the Hood! Son of the
         devil worshipper.
                       ROBIN
         What is your pleasure, Gisborne?

                       GISBORNE
         It was I who strung your father's
         corpse to the castle gate. My
         pleasure will be in doing the same
         to you.
                       ROBIN
         You survived one meeting.    Our next
         will be your last.
                       GISBORNE
         Your father died a coward, cursing
         your name and squealing like a
         stuck pig.
                         ROBIN
         That's a lie!
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     40.

Incensed, he is losing his judgement.
                          ASLAN
                   (shouts)
            Come, Robin! He is trying to
            anger you into a trap.
A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in
fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne
split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters
them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to
follow.

Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub.
Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
                          ROBIN
            We have lost them. I'll lame this
            mare if I ask her to go any farther.
He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens
his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
it to his eye. A primitive telescope.
Robin watches, curious.

SCOPE POV
Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
them.


BACK TO SCENE
                          ASLAN
            Here they come. Look.
Robin puts the device to his eye...

SCOPE POV
The soldiers are close!

BACK TO SCENE
He reacts in shock. Prepares to defend himself.    Then
realizes they are still in the distance.

         Is this Arab magic?

         No.    Arab science.
He replaces the tube in his pouch.
                       ASLAN
         How did your uneducated
         kind ever take Jerusalem?
                        ROBIN
         God knows!

Aslan laughs.   Robin points towards an endless expanse of
trees.
                       ROBIN
         We can lose them in the forest.
                       DUNCAN
         Sherwood is haunted, Master.
                       ROBIN
         Either we take our chances
         with the ghosts, or become
         ghosts ourselves.
He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men
thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering
around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin
looks back.
                       ROBIN
         They're not following.

Gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
                       GISBORNE
         Come on, damn you! There are
         only three of them.
                       SOLDIER
         It's not the men we fear, sir.
Eerie HOWLING and RATTLING of bones.    Aslan draws his
sword.
                       DUNCAN
         Banshees. They say they fly in
         your mouth and suck you dry of
         blood before you can scream.
He wraps his scarf over his mouth.

                         ROBIN
         Be quiet!    Listen.
WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly
SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites
around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds,
striking only air.
                       ASLAN
         Allah protect us from the evil
         spirits.
Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points.
                        ROBIN
         Behind you!
Aslan slashes out, futilely.
                         ROBIN
         No, there!    And there!
Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up.
                       ASLAN
         Cease your mad laughing.     I can
         feel them.
Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
A low chilling MOAN.
                       ROBIN
         Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A
         child's toy put to good use. You
         scare easily, my painted Saladin.
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
Catapults him to the ground.
The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-
century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL
SCARLET, leaps around Robin.
                       WILL SCARLET
                (singing)
         Ring around the rosie!
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!
Aslan makes no move to intervene.

The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to
grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall
         down. Beg for mercy, rich man.
                       ROBIN
         I beg of no man. Which of you
         scum has guts enough to face
         me man to man?
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Yeah, bollocks, mate.

Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.
His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes
when he laughs, which is often.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         What are ya, m'old cock?
                       ROBIN
         Er... Robin...
He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
                        ROBIN
         ...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are
         you?

         Bestman?   You lead this rabble?

         We waste time. Tax him.
                        ROBIN
         Tax?   For what?
                       WILL SCARLET
         For passage through Sherwood.
                       ROBIN
         I will pay no tax. Besides, I
         have nothing but my cloak and
         my sword.

         A man who travels with two servants
         and claims he's without money, is
         either a fool or a liar.
Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something
CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily,
Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet.
                       WILL SCARLET
         And this one is a liar.
                (he bites the metal)
         Ahah! Gold!
The men cheer.   John snatches the medallion back from
Will.
                       ROBIN
         That is sacred to me.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Sacred to us too, mush. This
         here'll feed us for a bloomin'
         month.
Robin draws his sword.
                       ROBIN
         You will have to fight me for it.

He grins hugely.   A boy pushes his way through the throng.

         Wait, father!    I know him.
                       ROBIN
         This man is your father? Tell him
         how I saved your hide from the
         Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves
         some gratitude, I believe.
He reaches for the medallion.    John pulls it away.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Naw ya don't, laddie.
                       WILL SCARLET
         You must be Robin of Locksley.
         The blackguard who abandoned us to
         Nottingham's plundering.

         Be careful, Father. He fights

         Sheriff's men?
                        JOHN LITTLE
         Is that so?
Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he
lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free.
Bends it into a pretzel.
                        ROBIN
         Aslan!

Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with
one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's
stomach. Robin folds.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Oh dear! The little rich boy is
         lost for words. Thanks for the
         taxes, Locksley.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         And for the laughs.
The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into
the tree. Will administers one final kick before
leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously
at Aslan.
                       ROBIN
         Son of an Arab whore! Once again
         your assistance was invaluable.

         you cease your brave talk of
         revenge and flee to the north.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The
ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge.
Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge,
brandishing a long wooden staff.
                       ROBIN
         This is my bridge. No one crosses
         without paying tax.

         Just bugger off, mate, huh?
                       ROBIN
         If you wish to cross, it will
         cost you a gold medallion.

         should I call you 'Little John'?
John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   Strides to the
bridge.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Alright, m'old cock. You wanna
         nuther good wallopin'?
His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
connects a blow on John's foot.
The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
Enjoying the time of his life.
Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
Aslan watches impassively.
Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits,
grinning.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Lil' wet behind the ears, mate?
                       WILL SCARLET
         Don't fool with him. Get him!

John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
him time to right himself.
John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from
the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Swimmin' time again, ol' chum.
The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters.
Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not
re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank.
No sign.

                       JOHN LITTLE
         Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave
         'un.
Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp
onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might.
John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
                        JOHN LITTLE
         Help!   Cain't bloody swim.
He submerges again.   Robin pulls his head above water.
                         ROBIN
         Do you yield?

The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing
with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the
surface.
                         ROBIN
         Do you yield?
                         JOHN LITTLE
         Yes!
                        ROBIN
         Good.   Now put your feet down.
John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water
only reaches his chest.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         I'll be buggered.
                       ROBIN
         Pay me the tax.
A tense pause while all wait for Little's reaction.
                       JOHN LITTLE
         Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid
         rock.
He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he
swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and
fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.
                        LITTLE JOHN
         Mead.   Made it m'self.

                   (drinks)
            A fine brew, Little John.
He spits black objects from his mouth.      Dead bees.   John
grins.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            Real honey.
He takes the jug back. Sneezes royally, spewing all over
the brew. Oblivious, he hands the contaminated jug to
Aslan.
                          ASLAN
            With regrets, I decline.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            An Englishman's mead not bleedin'
            good enough for ya?
                          ASLAN
            On the contrary. I thank you,
            but my faith prevents me from
            partaking in such enjoyments.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            Your bloody loss, mate.
He swigs.    Passes the jug on to Duncan, who drinks
heartily.    Wulf cautiously approaches Robin.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            What is it, boy? Speak up!
                          WULF
            I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley.
            I owes ya m'life.
                          ROBIN
            You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am
            glad I chanced by in time to help.
                          LITTLE JOHN
            C'mon, lad, drink! 'Twill put
            hair on your bloomin' chest.
Wulf tries the brew. The impact is instant.       He turns
green and runs. His father cracks up.
                          ROBIN
            Tell me about your men, John.
John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree
trunk.

                       ROBIN
         How do you come by the name, Bull?
                       BULL
         'Cuz o' my size, Sire.
                       ROBIN
         Because you are short?
                        BULL
         Nay.   'Cuz I be so long.

Proudly, he starts to pull down his pants.
                         ROBIN
         No, Bull.    Save it for the ladies.
Drunken laughter.    Robin turns to the next man at the
fireside.
                       ROBIN
         Your name, friend?
The man's bald pate blushes scarlet as he tries to
respond, but he stutters too badly to get out a
comprehensible word.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         That be Hal Brownwell, but the
         lads call i'm Hal Hiccup.
The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up
at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his
tormentors.
                       ROBIN
         Hold! Hal, you have the face and
         hands of a farmer. I wager you
         are a strong and honest man, and
         I'd be glad to have you at my side
         in a fight. The next man who makes
         light of you will have to answer
         to me.
There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects
to try it.
                       ROBIN
         How is it there are so many of
         you in hiding?

         Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes.
                       ROBIN
         How do you fare?
                       LITTLE JOHN
         We get by, I reckon.
                       ROBIN
         While the Sheriff steals your
         land and your families starve?

                       LITTLE JOHN
         What in bloody blazes'd ya have
         us do?
                       ROBIN
         Your ghosts will only keep his
         men at bay so long, my friend.
         Soon the Sheriff will hunt you
         down and hang you. You must
         fight back.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         We show as much as a toe outside
         the forest, they'll slaughter us
         like bleedin' sheep.
                       ROBIN
         We must organize. Win by guile.

         'We'? Ya lookin' to join us,

         No.   To lead you.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Ha! I would never be led by the
         son of a Druid.
                       ROBIN
         There are many here who knew my
         father to be a kind and generous
         man. I doubt that in their hearts
         they believe him capable of such a
         horror.
Murmurs of agreement from around the fire.    Robin turns
to Will.

         Count me not a friend, Locksley.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Stuff a flippin' cork in it, Will.
         The man's our guest.
Will gets up.   Angrily pushes his way out of the group.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im
         no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind.

                       ROBIN
         He is right to distrust me. I am
         a rich man's son. I have done no
         honest labor. But today I am as
         poor as any of you. Nottingham
         has stolen all that I own. And
         when I killed Gisborne's men, I,
         too, became an outlaw.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all,

         Ya must be bloody jokin'.

         We can win.   And I believe we will.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood,
         but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give

         tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky!
         Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack
         that blasted noble head in two.
Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long
draught of mead.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - SUNRISE
A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose
of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around
him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with
rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess.
Robin sits, brooding.

         army. These men live like dogs.
                         ROBIN
         English dogs.    They can learn.
                        ASLAN
         Learn what?   To build kennels?
He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan
is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side.
The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously
hung-over.

                       ROBIN
         Too much mead, old friend.    What
         day is it?
                       DUNCAN
         Sunday, I believe.
                       ROBIN
         Good. Do they still give alms
         to the poor at the mass?
                       DUNCAN
         They do. These days the need for
         mercy is greater than ever.
                       ROBIN
         Then I must ask you a favor.
EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY

Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body
stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is
the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham.
Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and
spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin,
dressed as Duncan.

EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing
stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.
                         GUARD
         Hey, you!
Robin keeps going.   A hand clasps his shoulder.    Spins
him 'round.

Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.   The Guard
sniffs his soiled hand.
                       GUARD
         My God, you stink!
                       ROBIN
         Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm
         always falling down.
                        GUARD
         Yeech!   Get away from me.

He launches a kick in Robin's rear. Robin hobbles away,
hiding a smile. The Guard tries to wipe off his hand on
the wall.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
Jesus hangs from the cross. A magnificent stained glass
window. In the ornate pulpit, the BISHOP OF HEREFORD,
bedecked in ermine.
                       BISHOP
         We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on
         all your people, but most
         especially on our noble Lord
         Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom
         to guide and protect our glorious
         city.
Nottingham and Gisborne sit piously among the congrega-
tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.
                       BISHOP
         Grant him also the strength to
         bring to justice the lawless men
         who threaten its safety. Help
         him to stamp out the curse of the
         dread Druids who would seize from
         us our children, even as wolves
         steal the lambs from their mothers.
The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the
poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children.
Among them, Robin.
The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are
galvanized. Begging hands reach out.

         5.   Etc.
The rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble.
Church officials roughly keep order. Marian passes some
coins to the mother of a small child. A hand grabs her
wrist.
                       ROBIN
         Alms for a blind man. For one
         who cannot see your beauty.

                       MARIAN
                (recognizing him)
         This is dangerous.

         So you care for my safety?
                       MARIAN
         No, for mine. I do not wish
         to be seen with an outlaw.
                       ROBIN
         Under the Sheriff's law, that's
         a badge of pride.
                       MARIAN
         He's put a price on your head.
                       ROBIN
         How much?

                       MARIAN
         A hundred gold pieces.
                       ROBIN
         Is that all? I have not annoyed
         him enough. Soon he will offer
         ten thousand.
                       MARIAN
         For ten thousand I would turn you
         in myself.
                (glances back at
                 the Sheriff)
         Nottingham is mounting an army.

         armor.

         What is he planning?
                       MARIAN

         If you need me, I will be with

         What?

         Take a bath.
                       ROBIN
         Care to join me?
With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham
arrives.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         You shine like the sun, my lady.
He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle.
Kisses it.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You have been meeting with young
         Robin of Locksley.
                (as she tries to

         My cousin tells me the knave
         deprived you of some horses.

         For subjecting you to such

         the walls with his own entrails.
That gleam of insanity.   Robin watches from a distance.
                       MARIAN
         I would like to see that, my lord.
The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         My dear, a woman of your refinement
         is not safe living alone. If you
         would consent to bring your
         household within the city walls,
         I could give your needs my most
         personal attention.
                       MARIAN
         I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from
         the heart, but for now I prefer to
         stay in my family's ancestral home.
         My cousin, King Richard, will be
         deeply moved to hear of your
         concern for my welfare.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Alas, the King has many enemies
         both abroad and at home. I fear
         for his safe return.
                       MARIAN
         Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will
         return. When he does, he will
         wish to reward his faithful subjects.
The Sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. Marian
deflates with relief. The Sheriff walks alone towards
a side door.
                       BEGGAR
                (Robin)
         Alms, my lord.
Nottingham makes to shove the man aside. With a swift
move, the beggar grabs the Sheriff in a headlock.
Slides Nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags
him out of sight.

                       ROBIN
         A hundred crowns, Sheriff?   You
         insult me.
Nottingham starts to struggle.   Robin draws blood.
                       ROBIN
         Remember young Robin of Locksley,
         Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your
         nemesis. Your avenging angel.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         If you kill me, you will hang.
                       ROBIN
         If I kill you, I will hang happy.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you want?
                       ROBIN
         I want to give you a chance. A
         chance you do not deserve. A
         chance to right your wrongs.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         I'm listening.
                       ROBIN
         From this day forward you will
         cease to tax my people. You will
         renounce the charges against my
         father, and you will return his
         lands to me.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Why should I?
                       ROBIN
         Because for every harm you do,
         I swear by God I shall visit on
         you threefold in return.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Empty words.
                       ROBIN
         I am here with a blade at your
         throat. As long as I live, you
         will always know that I could be
         here again.
A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them.
Robin digs the knife a little deeper.

         Never, fool.
                       ROBIN
         Then it will begin..
Gisborne yells orders.   Robin hurls Nottingham against
the wall.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY

Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's
horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides
through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks
him. A sure shot.
Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and
stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly
into the air.
                       MARIAN
                (innocently)
         Please excuse my clumsiness.
Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks
the guard who hasseled him into the wall.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
Men gather around as Robin dismounts, admiring the horse.

                       ROBIN
         A personal loan from the Sheriff.
                       ASLAN
                (furious)
         You should not have left without
         me, Englishman.
                       ROBIN
         How so? You have not raised a
         finger to protect me.
                       ASLAN
         Before I had a choice.
                       ROBIN
         It was my choice to do this alone.

                       ASLAN
         A foolish risk. If you had been
         killed, I would be cursed for
         eternity for failing to fulfil
         my pledge.
                       ROBIN
         Aslan, if I didn't know better,
         I would swear you were worried
         about me.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL
The Sheriff maniacally spits out orders to Gisborne.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Starve them out. Slaughter their
         livestock. I want to see Locksley's
         own people fighting each other to
         bring him to us.
                       GISBORNE
         I swear he will not live to see
         the next full moon.

EXT. HAMLET - DAY
A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a wagon. SOLDIERS round
up the livestock. An old FARMER protests.
                       FARMER
         Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the
         sow. She's with young 'uns. The
         next litter'll feed us through
         the winter.
                       SOLDIER
         You've heard of Robin Hood?
                       FARMER
         Yes, sir.
The Soldier brutally kicks the old man to the ground.
                       SOLDIER
         Then pray he is brought to us
         before winter.

Wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings.    A contingent
of woodsmen confronts Robin.
                       WILL SCARLET
         You brought this misery on us,
         Locksley. We can barely feed
         ourselves.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody
         pot to piss in.
                       ROBIN
         Then we shall take from him and
         his rich friends.

This provokes a barrage of protests.   The men are angry.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Brave talk, Locksley. I say we
         take the rich boy in.
Murmurs of general agreement.
                       ROBIN
         Will, do you think the Sheriff will
         give everything back after I am
         gone?
                       WILL SCARLET
         He will give us the reward, and
         our pardons.
                       ROBIN
         Alright, Will. You can take me
         in on one condition. You must
         fight me. You may use the Sheriff's
         horse and arm yourself as you
         please. I will fight on foot.
         Unarmed.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Unarmed?

         If you lose, you will accept me
         as your leader. If you win, you
         may take me in. Dead or alive.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Dead, Locksley.

                                                      62.
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY (LATER)
Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his
cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators.
Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to themselves,
while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan.
Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged
with scars.
                       ASLAN
         This man has true purpose.    He
         means to kill you.
                       DUNCAN
         And you have given him the means.
                       WULF
         Will is ruthless, Robin.    Guard
         your back.
                       ROBIN
         I am grateful for your concern,
         friends, but I have to prove to
         them it is possible to overcome
         unequal odds.
                (shouts)
         I am ready, Will.
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
back to the attack.
His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.

Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
chest.
Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.
Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough.
Douses his face. Yells at Will.

         Come on, you little piss pot.
         Do your worst!
Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his
ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps.
                       ROBIN
         The horse is smarter than you are,
         Will.
Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks
and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges.
Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.

                        ROBIN
         Here, Will!   You aim like a girl,
         Will!
Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
wards off his mount.
Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.
                       ROBIN
         Thank the Lord you are not endowed
         like Bull.

The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his
breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and
runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is
about to strike.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Bollocks, Will. Jus' bugger off,
         eh?
Overpowered, Will relents.   With a defiant glance, he
skulks away.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya got us by the short and curlies,
         Robin Hood. Now let's hear what ya

Robin scans the faces.     He has their attention.
                          ROBIN
            Nottingham has taken from us
            everything we own. Now we are

EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Autumn. The forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange,
and red. A giant eye in a circle of glass. Aslan, his
telescope raised.
                          ASLAN
            Here they come.
                          ROBIN
            How many?
                           ASLAN
            Two wagons.   Twenty escort.
                           ROBIN
            Twenty?   They usually have five.
He grabs the telescope.

SCOPE POV
A phalanx of   mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with
barrels, and   a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on
wheels, with   crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne
commands the   escort.
BACK TO SCENE
                          ROBIN
            This is no ordinary convoy.
Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods-
men lies nervously in ambush.
                          BULL
            'ow many?

         Er, about ten.
                (then, to Aslan)
         Why scare them? They can't count
         anyway.
                       ASLAN
         And they call me the barbarian.
                         ROBIN
         Let's go.
Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into
the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap
into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and
grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.

The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the
cliff.
BACK ON ROADWAY
Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,
driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.

CONTINUED:
Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.
He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and
cursing.
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     Angry shouts
from inside.
                       ROBIN
         Surrender your weapons. I give
         you my word you shall go free.
In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near
his feet.

                       ROBIN
         Ah, I feared as much.
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,
panic. Drowning rats.
The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead.
Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.
                                               CUT TO:
COUNTRYSIDE
Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The
lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in
astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with
glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around.
Cheers of celebration.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (awestruck)
         I'll be buggered.
                       ROBIN
         This treasure had a purpose.     We
         must find out what.
He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart.
The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies.
                        ROBIN
         Get off him.   He's a man of the
         cloth.
Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet.
Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen.

         The Lord's blessing on you, kind
         sir. These sinners were attempting
         to steal these libations destined
         for the monks of St. Catherine's.
He indicates his cargo of barrels.
                       ROBIN
         It appears to me, Reverend Friar,
         that many of the libations have
         found their way into your own
         esteemed person.
Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart.

                       FRIAR
         A thousand pardons, sir, but duty
         beckons. I must hasten on.
                       ROBIN
                (grabbing the bridle)
         A moment, my reverend friend. You
         travel with poor company when you
         travel with Nottingham's soldiers.
                         BULL
         Aye, tax him.
This sparks a chorus of comments.
                       ROBIN
         My men are thirsty and have much
         to celebrate.
                       FRIAR
         Lord bless me, sir, are these your
         men? I had mistook them for
         common thieves. Kindly step
         aside.
                       ROBIN
         Surely the Lord has the charity to
         spare a few barrels to good
         Christian men.
The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins.
                       FRIAR
         Well, sir, if you wish them to
         share in the good Lord's brew...
Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club.
Smites Robin with it.

                       FRIAR
         ... you must best me for it.
Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed,
Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal
full in the face.
                         FRIAR
         Giddyup, nag!
The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs
after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the
cart.

                       ROBIN
         You leave when I say.
Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.
                       FRIAR
         Protect me, Lord.
He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under
him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!
                         FRIAR
         Yield!
He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe.
The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle.
                       FRIAR
         Confess that Friar Tuck is a
         better, holier, and braver man
         than thou art, knave.

                        ROBIN
         Never!   Whoomf!
                         FRIAR
         Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar
         Tuck.
Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls.
Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes
the Friar's head with his drinking jug.
                       ROBIN
         Yield yourself!
He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the
ground.

                       ROBIN
         Yield to Robin Hood.
Tuck holds up a hand in surrender.    Robin eases off.
                       FRIAR
                (feeling his head)
         Thank you, Lord, for teaching me
         humility.
                       ROBIN
         Well, Friar Tuck. We have need
         of an honest man of God, to
         minister to these men and their
         families. What do you say?

The Friar struggles to his feet. He reviews the motley
faces of his potential flock. His eyes light on the
grinning Saracen.
                       FRIAR
         I'd rather roast in hell.
He punches Robin in the gut.
                                              CUT TO:

FRIAR TUCK
strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. Sweating
profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly
follows.
                       ROBIN
         Giddyup, Friar.

He flicks the reins, steering the cart into camp. Women
and children rush to greet their men. Jeer the roped
soldier-prisoners. The Friar checks out his flock. A
woman curtsies, another crosses herself, children touch
his robe in wonder.
                       ROBIN
         What do you say now, Tuck?    Here
         are the meek of the earth.
Tuck surveys the hopeful, hungry faces. The little
hamlet of half-built huts. He folds his hands in a
moment of prayer.
                       FRIAR
         The Lord moves in mysterious
         ways. I accept.

         Aye, but you may.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP
A blazing fire. Deer carcasses roast. Tuck's barrels
supply the refreshment. Robin and Aslan pass out coins
to each family.
                       ROBIN
         Buy yourself a new son, Stephen.
                       FARMER
         Thankee, Robin.
Little John and Bull approach. John indicates the two
prisoners roped to a nearby tree.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa

                       ASLAN
         Perhaps it is time for some
         heathen persuasion.
                                            CUT TO:
CAPTAIN OF SOLDIERS
stares up at Robin defiantly.
                       CAPTAIN
         Spare your breath. I know nothing.
                       ROBIN
                (reasonable)
         I believe you. But this Arab here,
         he's got it into his barbarian
         brain that you know a whole lot
         more than nothing.

         And when he gets like this,
         he's very hard to reason with.
With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan   leaps INTO VIEW.
Stripped to the waist, brandishing   his scimitar. The
Captain tries to back away. Robin    tries to restrain
Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,    drooling at the mouth,
Aslan explores the Captain's body   with his hands. A
butcher checking meat.
                       ROBIN
         I strongly advise you to talk.
         He hasn't eaten in weeks.

                       CAPTAIN
                (rising terror)
         What does he want?
                       ROBIN
         You.
                       CAPTAIN
         For Godsakes, get him off me!
                       ROBIN
                (very deliberately)
         No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan.
         ... How about this other one?...
         Fatter, yes... more meat.
The other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the
bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as Aslan turns his
attention to him. With one swing   of his sword, Aslan
slices through the man's ropes.   Drags him to his feet.
Little John runs over.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (urgent)
         No, Robin, no! They be God-fearin'
         men.
                       ROBIN
         I cannot stop him, John. Besides,
         if they will not tell what they
         know, then they must pay the price.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Kill 'em aye, but not like this.
         'Tain't Christian.
Blood-curdling SCREAMS from behind the wagon where Aslan
has dragged his victim. The Captain's face pales. Then
silence.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                     72.
CONTINUED:
The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his
lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end
of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm.
Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates
wildly at the Captain.
                       CAPTAIN
         What does he say?
                       ROBIN
         Well, roughly, he says that he
         doesn't care for the way your
         friend tastes, and he wants you.
                       CAPTAIN
         No, God, no! I'll talk. Just
         keep him away. Keep him away!

BEHIND WAGON
Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth
and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside them
lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed,
except that he's missing a glove.

INT. WOODSMAN'S HUT - NIGHT
The walls shake with Little John's laughter.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Sure changed the color of 'is
         britches, didn't 'e?
                       ROBIN
         Thanks to our cannibal friend.
Aslan repeats his wildman act, munching on a chunk of
venison.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Gonna laugh my bloody balls off.
                       BULL
         Why'd the Sheriff be sendin' gold
         north o' the border?
                       ROBIN
         To hire mercenaries. The Celts
         are savage tribesmen, trained
         to kill from birth.

         Since he also has every Smith
         in the country working in his
         castle, we can assume he is
         planning a little war.

         Agin' who?

                       ASLAN
         England.

INT. CASTLE ARMORY - NIGHT
Sparks. Smoke. Sweat. The Sheriff inspects his weapon
factory. His eyes glint with the reflections of the
smithy's fires.
A DOOR CRASHES open behind him. FOOTSTEPS. Paying no
heed, he draws a sword from a furnace. It's blade white-
hot.
                       GISBORNE
         We were ambushed. In Sherwood
         Forest.
Nottingham tests the sword against an anvil.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Spanish steel, cousin. So much
         stronger than our native blades.
         Any losses?
                       GISBORNE
         All the men are gone.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Yet again you are the sole
         survivor, cousin? Interesting.
         And the gold?
                       GISBORNE
         Well, it er... disappeared.

The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time.

         Robin Hood?
                       GISBORNE
         They were woodsmen, dressed in
         green.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Robin Hood.
He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Cousin, we must be strong. We
         cannot allow this outlaw to make
         fools of us.
Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's
belly.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         And I cannot allow a lieutenant
         to fail me.
                (turning to the
                 horrified smithy)
         It is indeed fine steel.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
A small procession. Tuck drives his cart, Bull the tax
wagon. Both vehicles laden with supplies. Wulf and Hal
pass out flour, chickens, blankets, clothing to the
villagers. Their weapons are prominently displayed.
Tuck swigs from a jar, passes it to an old villager.
                       FRIAR
         God bless you, sir.
                       VILLAGER
         An' Go' bless Robin 'Ood, friar.
         They says as 'ow none o' the
         Sheriff's cronies dare go within
         miles o' Sherwood for fear o'
         havin' their pockets pinched.

mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his
jug in greeting.

         Good morrow, brothers.

EXT. FOREST POOL - DAY
Water, sparkling with sunlight. Bursts, as Robin dives
in naked. He luxuriates in the cool water... HOOFBEATS.
He attempts to hide... too late. Four horses emerge from
the trees. Bull and Hal, with Marian and her servant
Sarah sandwiched between them. Bull has a black eye.
Marian jumps down.
                       MARIAN
                (to Robin)
         How dare you!
                       ROBIN
         Good morning, Lady Marian.
In response, she starts pelting him with stones.
                       MARIAN
         You send men to drag me from my
         home in the middle of the night,
         like some slave girl? Is this
         the way the famous Robin Hood
         treats a lady?
                       ROBIN
         Ah well... er, let me finish this
         bath you wished me to take. Then
         I'll explain.
                       MARIAN
         I demand an explanation right now!

He wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her.
She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.
                       MARIAN
         How dare you expose yourself to
         me?!
She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water.
Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own
black eye.
                       BULL
         The big 'un did the same to me.


EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
An arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a
tree. Little John lowers his crossbow, delighted at
his shot.
                       LITTLE JOHN
                (to Wulf)
         Right m'lad. Let's see how close
         you can git to that bugger.
Wulf takes aim. His arrow slices clear through his
father's arrow, splitting it in two. Little John slaps
Wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Take a gander at this 'un, mates.
         Never seen nuthin' like it in
         my bloomin' life.

Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of
a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not
about to admit it.
                       MARIAN
         This better be damned important.
Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap-
tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats
and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws
back the lid. Marian is speechless.
                       ROBIN
         Nottingham robs the poor. We
         rob Nottingham and give back to

          man is without mercy. He will
          annihilate you.
                        ROBIN
          Somebody has to take a stand.
                        MARIAN
          You're taking a stand with the
          lives of these people. These
          young ones.
A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's.
Is there a hint of concern for him also?
                        MARIAN
          What do you want from me?
                        ROBIN
          Nottingham was sending this gold
          to buy reinforcements from the
          Celtic tribesmen. We need to
          warn King Richard.
                        MARIAN
          Nottingham would not dare
          challenge the King.
                        ROBIN
          The King is not in England to
          be challenged, is he? While he
          is away, he may lose his country.
                 (Marian masks her
                  concern)
          You are Richard's cousin. You
          can get word to him. He would
          believe you.
                        MARIAN
          Now you want me to participate
          in your folly?
A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild
flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering.

                       ROBIN
                (to Marian)
         I am sending Duncan with you.
         Give him some warm food and a
         real bed. I grow tired of his
         bellyaching.
                       DUNCAN
         Hah! I have endured more hardship
         in my lifetime than any man here.
Robin laughs and speaks to Marian in a stage whisper.
                       ROBIN
         Don't tell him I told you, but
         he may be useful to you. There
         is no one to whom I would rather
         entrust your safety.
                       MARIAN
         Duncan, you are most welcome.
Taking the lead rein from Duncan's horse, she rides away.
                       ROBIN
                (calls after her)
         Will you send word to the King?
                       MARIAN
         I'll think about it.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY
A globule of red liquid.    A signet ring.   Marian seals
a letter.


INT. BISHOP'S CASTLE - DAY
The letter is held in the pudgy, jeweled fingers of the
Bishop of Hereford. A lavish office.
                       MARIAN
         It is a personal matter, my Lord,
         but one of vital importance.
                       BISHOP
         I understand, my dear lady.
         This is my most trusted emissary.
He hands the letter to a solemn courier.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                      79.

                       MARIAN
         You will travel to France
         immediately. You must give this
         directly into the hands of the
         King, and him alone.
The courier bows in acknowledgement.    Marian indicates
Sarah.
                       MARIAN
         My lady-in-waiting will accompany
         you.
Surprised, the courier glances at the Bishop.

                       BISHOP
         My dear, I could not vouch for
         her safety. The journey is fraught
         with danger.
                       MARIAN
         I appreciate your concern, my
         Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished
         rider. I must insist that she
         goes along.
                       BISHOP
                (a beat)
         As you wish.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
An informal council of war.   Robin uses a stick in the
dirt.

                       ROBIN
         We have to be ready to move camp
         at any time. The only way we can
         be attacked is from the Nottingham
         Road. We hide lookouts in the
         trees, here and here. If they
         see soldiers, they shoot warning
         arrows. Whistles by day, fire
         by night.
Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.
                        WULF
         Father!   Come quick.   Mother's
         dying.

                                                       80.
INT. WOODSMEN'S HUT - DAY
Fanny Little writhes in agony.    John rushes in.   Tuck
looks up from Fanny's side.
                       FRIAR
         The child comes early.
Fanny screams.   John kneels beside her, taking her head.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Hush, m'lass.    Ya'll be fine.
                       FANNY
         'S not like t'others, John.    Oh
         God, it pains me so.

                       LITTLE JOHN
                (angrily, to Tuck)
         Ya're sittin' thar like a fat
         sow. Help her, man, help her!
                       FRIAR
         I am doing all I can.
Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the
blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming
creatures.
                       ASLAN
         By Allah, leeches!
He starts to pull the parasites off.    Tuck jumps at him.
                       FRIAR
         Get away from her!
Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work.

                       ASLAN
         Blood is like air. If she loses
         blood, she and the child will die.
John is paralyzed with confusion.    Tuck appeals to Robin.
                       FRIAR
         He lies. He is the devil's seed,
         sent to lead us astray.
                       ASLAN
         Fool, both the Bible and the Koran
         instruct us to preserve life.
Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the
blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.

                       ASLAN
                (soothing)
         Your baby has not turned. It
         cannot be born without help.
                       FRIAR
         What do you know, you damned
         savage?
                       ASLAN
                (to John)
         If you will allow me, I can help
         her. It will not be without
         danger.

                       FRIAR
         Do not listen to him!   He will
         kill her.
                       ASLAN
         If you do not listen to me, she
         will certainly die. And the
         child, too.
Fanny cries out.   John looks to Robin, pleading for
advice.
                       ROBIN
         The good Friar has done all he
         can. I suggest you let the Arab
         try.
                (as John is
                 undecided)
         If I am wrong, and they die, then
         you may take my life.

John's eyes meet his wife's.   She nods.
                        LITTLE JOHN
         So be it.
                       FRIAR
         Then it will be on your head.
         I have warned you.
He storms out.   All business, Aslan speaks to Wulf.
                       ASLAN
         Bring me a needle, thread, water,
         a skinning knife, and burning
         ashes.
Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases
him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They
whisper.

          What are you going to do?
                        ASLAN
          The child must be taken out by
          the knife.
                          ROBIN
          The knife?
                        ASLAN
          I have seen it many times with
          horses.
                       ROBIN
          Horses? By the Lord, what are
          her chances?
                        ASLAN
          After wasting so much blood...
          not good.
                        ROBIN
          Now you tell me!
Wulf runs back in.     Aslan holds up a piece of wood.
                        ASLAN
                 (to Fanny)
          Are you ready?... Bite down on
          this... Robin, hold her steady.
He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.

OUTSIDE

Little John paces. Wulf comes out of the hut.      Families
hover and wait. From inside, MUFFLED GROANS.
                        FRIAR
          I tell you, the barbarian is
          killing her.
John moves to the hut.     Wulf restrains him.

INSIDE
The mother heaves, then drops.
                          ROBIN
          Is she gone?

Aslan ignores him, keeps working over Fanny's body.
Robin cannot watch... a WAIL! Aslan mutters something
in awed Arabic.
                       ROBIN
         What did you say?
Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.
                        ASLAN
         It is a boy.
The mother revives.   Aslan places the child on her
breast.

                       ASLAN
         Your son, my lady... Robin, hold
         her skin together while I sew her
         up.
He picks up the needle and thread.   Robin's eyes turn to
the woman's abdomen... He faints.
                                             CUT TO:

LITTLE JOHN
marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn
child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one
side. Bloody and  exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut
door. Tuck jumps  to his feet, drawing his knife.
Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily,
behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares
at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across
his own wrist.
                       FRIAR
         This day God has taught me a fine
         lesson.
He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
                       FRIAR
         I would be honored.
Aslan slices his own wrist. The two wrists clasp
together in the universal sign of brotherhood. Everyone
cheers.
                       FRIAR
         You are a good man, my barbarian
         friend.

         We shall open a barrel together
         and I shall do my damndest to
         save your heathen soul.
                       ASLAN
         Alas, I am not permitted...
                       FRIAR
         Our God made this brew, brother.
         I merely combined the ingredients.
         Do you dare to insult his works?

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Hooves fly along a track. Sarah and the courier.    The
courier reins in, Sarah draws alongside.
                       SARAH
         What is wrong?
                       COURIER
         My horse seems to be favoring
         a foreleg.
Sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her
across the neck. She falls from the saddle, unconscious.

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Flickering candlelight. Marian is alone, reading. A
sudden gust extinguishes her candle. HAMMERING and
SHOUTING from a distant part of the house. Unnerved,
she calls out.

                          MARIAN
         Who is there?     Duncan!

INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a
drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!...
A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She
shoos him down.
                       MARIAN
         Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice.
She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   A
masked SOLDIER.

                       SOLDIER
         We meet again.
He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his
mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods
her with his sword.
                       SOLDIER
         Drop your blade.
                       MARIAN
         You are still overmatched, soldier.
She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table.
Lays his blade against her chest.

                       SOLDIER
         You owe me favors, wench. Bare
         your breasts... or I will do it
         for you.
Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her
dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs
a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face.
Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her
dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the
fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives
the point clean through  his chest.
He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the
cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked
soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging
the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door.
                       DUNCAN
         I am sorry, my lady.    There were
         too many.
She stares at the invaders with studied calm.
                       MARIAN
         Is there something you need,
         gentlemen? I remember no masked
         ball on my calendar.

AERIAL SHOT
FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green,
intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING
AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in...

                                                      86.
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT
The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model.
These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord
Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with
a white rat on his arm.
                       REDHEAD BARON
         Forget about Locksley. He is no
         threat.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         How can we control all England if
         we cannot control our own county?
         The people are turning him into
         a hero.

                       GREYBEARD BARON
         It is impossible to attack him
         in the forest. We have tried
         everything. He is cunning.
                         NOTTINGHAM
         Then we   will be more cunning. I
         must be   rid of him. We may not
         be able   to intercept his next
         warning   to the King.
Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open.
Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor.
His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the
visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable
ferocity in his eyes.
                       CELTIC CHIEFTAIN
         I want the heads of the men who
         stole my gold.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Welcome, sir. We were discussing
         how to rid ourselves of those very
         men. The outlaws who band with
         Robin Hood.
                       REDHEAD BARON
         My Lord Nottingham, I must protest.
         It is a mistake to ally ourselves
         with foreigners.
                       GREYBEARD BARON
         What can these Celts do that we
         cannot?

The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a
burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log
spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head...
and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking
at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full
three seconds.
An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the
demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         This rat Hood has hidden out in
         the forest.  He resists all our
         assaults with traps and devices,
         while he robs us blind. We must
         bring him out and destroy him.
The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees.
The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches
the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT
SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its
escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and
again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - NIGHT
The campfire. Aslan shrieks a war cry.   Dervishes 'round
the fire, swigging from a jug. Equally  drunk, the Friar
follows, howling, mimicking him. Robin  and the others
watch in amusement. Tuck scoops another  jug and hands it
to Aslan.
                       FRIAR
         Come, you son of Saladin. A toast
         to all of Jehovah's children. The
         saved and the damned.
                       ASLAN
         This must be a truly evil potion,
         to make the soul feel this good.
He downs the entire jug in one long draught.   Refills it.
                       ASLAN
         Come, holy man. A toast to all
         of Allah's children. The true
         believers and the fat infidels.
Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the

looks at Robin.

         How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem
         when they can't even hold their
         brew?
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FOREST LANE - DAWN
A masked soldier gallops along.    Hurls a bundle to the
ground.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAWN

The Friar and the Saracen lie head to head on the dewey
grass. Tuck  snores. Robin shakes Aslan, who grabs for
his weapon.  The hangover hits him like a mallet. He
clutches his temples.
                       ROBIN
         The dancing demon! Good morning.
                       ASLAN
                (wincing)
         If it was Jehovah who created this
         brew, he is truly wise. He built
         the punishment into the crime.
An ARROW WHISTLES into a tree.    Robin reacts.
                       ROBIN
         They need help.


EXT. FOREST LANE - DAY
Bull and Hal are crouched in the roadway, over a body.
Robin runs up with Aslan. He kneels beside them. The
body is Duncan. Robin clasps a dead hand... Silence.
Fighting his emotions.
                       BULL
         A bloke wearin' a mask o' the
         Druids rode by. Tossed 'im down.
                       ROBIN
         Are you sure it was a Druid mask?
                (as Bull nods)
         Damn them to hell! They must have
         Marian. Do you know where they
         meet?
                                            (CONTINUED)

         The Gregor Caves, I 'eard tell.
                       ASLAN
         We will go there.
                       ROBIN
         No! You stay here, dammit!    I
         will go alone.
                       ASLAN
         You forget yourself.   I am not
         your servant.
                       ROBIN
         Then be my friend. There are
         women and children here in greater
         need of your courage.
                       ASLAN
                (considers)
         Take my eyes, then.
He hands Robin his telescope.
                                           CUT TO:

EXT. CAVES
SQUAWKING ominously, CROWS burst from the trees. Robin
rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
Checks the ground. Horse tracks. He dismounts, moves
cautiously forward.


POV THROUGH SCOPE - CIRCLE OF STONES
No one visible. Debris. Smoke rises from ashes.
Remnants of a recent ceremony.

BACK TO SCENE
Robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone
circle. There is blood on the sacrificial altar.
Through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form,
lying face down.
                       ROBIN
                (under his breath)
         Marian!
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       90.
CONTINUED:
He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white
from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across
Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
blackness.

INT. CAVE - DAY
Robin's eyes  -- he wakes. Squints around him, the dark
smoke-filled  recesses of the caves. The walls weave.
Eerie WATERY  sounds, like the CRIES of drowning men.
He tries to  stand.
                       VOICE (O.S.)
         Robin!... Robin!

A figure in a flowing white robe. Angelic. Floating
towards him... Marian. He tries to speak her name.
Reaches out his hand.
                       MARIAN
         Death is not to be feared,
         Robin. Embrace it.
Her LAUGH ECHOES around the cave, as if hundreds of lost
souls are laughing with her. Robin crawls away, cover-
ing his ears. Marian lifts his face to hers.
                        MARIAN
         Drink this.
Weakly, Robin tries to push away the cup.   Her hand
grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.
                        MARIAN
         Drink.

The liquid trickles over his lips. He tries to focus.
Her features are BLURRED, her voice hypnotic.
                       MARIAN
         Look at me. Listen to me. You
         belong to me. Your soul is mine.
         You will obey my every word. Do
         you understand?
Her face is inches from his. He tries to pull away, his
subconscious sounding alarms.
                        ROBIN
         Why, Marian?
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                       91.
CONTINUED:
                       MARIAN
         Because you love me. Say it.
         You love me.
                (as Robin struggles)
         Say it!
                       ROBIN
                (sinking)
         I love you.
                       MARIAN
         Kiss me.
He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something
changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face
starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of
Mortianna.
He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his
head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision,
we see he is surrounded by masked men.
                       ROBIN
                (slurred)
         Where is Marian?
                       MORTIANNA
         She is with friends.
                (cackles)
         Your resistence is strong, but
         useless. Sign this.
                (as quill is forced
                 into his hand)
         You are a Druid like your father.
         You consort with the devil. Your
         confession will be witnessed by
         the Bishop of Hereford.
A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then
cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be-
tween his shoulders.
In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling
beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan.
                       MORTIANNA
                (horror)
         The painted man!
Aslan's war CRY RICHOCHETS off the cave walls. A    curved
scimitar in one hand, a straight English sword in   the
other, his arms are lethal windmills. The masked    guards
are cut down left and right. Mortianna retreats,    scurry-
ing into the depths of the cave.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                     92.
CONTINUED:
Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling
in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf
stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy.
A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like
hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only
two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark-
ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his
feet... and lunges.
                          ASLAN
         Behind you!
Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan
grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into
the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks.
Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's.
Robin is slumped against a rock.
                       ROBIN
                (groggy)
         Marian?
Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is
crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words.
                       BULL
         Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian
         burial. Promise me, boy.
                          WULF
         I promise.
Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be-
low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock.
For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom,
hatred, fear -- then is gone.

EXT. GREGOR CAVES - DAY
Aslan carries Robin outside. Robin is staggering,
glassy-eyed, mumbling incoherently. His arm blocks
the light from his eyes.
                       ASLAN
         They have poisoned you. There
         are herbs that can alter a man's
         brain. I know of only one cure.
He drops to one knee, slams Robin violently across the
other. Slaps him on the back and forces his fingers
down his throat.

                (as Robin heaves)
         You will thank me for this later.

EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY
Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading
another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across
its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up
in front of him.
                       ROBIN
         You have fulfilled your vow.   Now
         you can leave.
                       ASLAN
         Your gratitude warms my heart.
                       ROBIN
         You ignored my request.
                       ASLAN
         It is fortunate that I did.
                       ROBIN
         Because of you, another good man
         is dead.
                       ASLAN
         He urged me to bring him. He was
         a brave man and I grieve for him.
         Praise be to Allah that I do not
         grieve for you also. Or for my
         broken vow.
                       ROBIN
         To hell with your damn vow.
                       ASLAN
         I am glad you are feeling
         better.
Ahead of them, Wulf shouts and reins in. He points into
the distance. A huge cloud of smoke is darkening the
sky.
                        ROBIN
         The forest!   Ride!

                                                       94.
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
Fire.   Blazing rampant.
Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire
arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming
arrows ignites the trees.
Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback.
One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the
black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock.

EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY
Chaos. Acrid black smoke pours across the clearing.
Disarray. COUGHING, SCREAMING, confusion. Little John
vainly attempts to instill calm.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Ya'll be jus' fine. Lil' smoke
          ain't gonna kill ya.
Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
Full retreat.
                        WILL SCARLET
                 (running up)
          It's burning for miles, John.
          It's hotter than hades, and them
          damn screens ain't worth nothing.
Two woodsmen, blinded and choking, stumble into one of
their own camouflaged pits. Hideous screams as they're
impaled on hidden stakes. John tries to gather the able-
bodied men to his side.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          'Ere, lads... Over 'ere! We must
          make a stand.
Most of them keep on running.
                        LITTLE JOHN
          Damn y'all! Ya're no more use
          than a load o' wet farts.
                        WILL SCARLET

         Gggg... God help us.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
Celts, arrayed behind their Chieftain. An awesome sight.
Clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head-
pieces the faces of wild animals. Standing in eerie
silence. A loud CLAP of THUNDER. Nottingham rides up
to the Chieftain.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         I want prisoners.
The Chieftain does not turn his head.
                       CHIEFTAIN
         We came to fight.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Nevertheless, I need prisoners.
With only a short flick of his head, the Chieftain spits.
Nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol-
diers to advance. The Chieftain raises his sword.
Instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors.
They charge forward.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
The bloodcurdling cry fills the sky. Amidst the smoke
and chaos, Little John's small band is gathered at the
edge of the clearing.
                       WILL SCARLET

Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including
Tack.

         Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin'

                       FRIAR
         This holy man believes in doing
         God's work with his hands.

He snatches a quarterstaff.    John slaps him on the back.
The men are encouraged.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Let's give 'em a bloody good
         wallopin' an' all, lads.

EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
Aslan reins in. In the valley below, the forest is
ablaze. The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em-
battled woodsmen.
                       ROBIN
         Wulf, stay here. I need your
         horse.
He climbs onto Wulf's horse, steers it right at the heart
of the enemy... Aslan blocks his way, grabbing his reins.

                       ROBIN
         What are you doing?    Out of my
         way!
                       ASLAN
         I saved your life. I will not

         purpose.
                       ROBIN
         Out of my way, damn you!

         Does the witch still have
         possession of your senses? If
         we meet up with the survivors we
         may yet give them some help. And
         do some damage to the enemy.

CONTINUED:
Robin debates.   Relents.   They urge their horses into
a gallop.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY
The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest.
From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's
men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat,
turn and fire again.
They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries
charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen
drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are
being decimated.

Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy,
inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant.
Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt.
                       FRIAR
         Surely you would not harm a man
         of the cloth?
The man swings, Tuck sidesteps.
                        FRIAR
         You would?   Then to hellfire with
         you.
He pummels the man to the ground with his staff.
The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group,
including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others
fight on.

Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded
by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out
expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his
attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through
them, slashing with his sword.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         'Bout bleedin' time, mush.
Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver-
ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck
glances heavenwards.
                       FRIAR
         Thank you, Lord.
                (an afterthought)
         And thank you, Allah.

CONTINUED:
Aslan is a   wild man. Steering his horse with just legs
and knees,   he strikes out with both swords to left and
right. The    momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the
edge of the   clearing. Starts picking off stragglers.
His father   spots him.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there,
         ya li'l bugger.
Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back...
but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He
freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet.
When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by
three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but
is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down.
Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down
with both swords. Both men topple to the ground
simultaneously.
Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass
of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive.
Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree
gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his
wounded shoulder.
Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed
and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Don't 'ee start bleedin'
         blubberin', or ya'll make me
         bloody vomit.

Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over.
All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen.
                       ASLAN
         It was a fiendish mind that
         planned this campaign.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK
A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a
grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery.
Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags
a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor
and weapons into a growing pile.

                       ROBIN
         You were an honor to your
         countrymen today, Aslan. You
         fought better than twenty
         English knights.
                       ASLAN
         This war is the God of Abraham
         against the forces of evil.
                       ROBIN
         Well, the war is over.
He stares across the desolate clearing.

                       ROBIN
         There is too much blood on my
         hands.

INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT
A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol-
lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber
where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them
Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the
floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime.
Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (wry smile)
         Would you prefer pain or death?
                        FIRST WOODSMAN
         Death.

Dignity masking his terror.    Nottingham appears to
consider.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         Torture him.
The man is dragged away by guards.    The next PRISONER --
                        NOTTINGHAM
         And you?   Pain or death?
                       SECOND WOODSMAN (PRISONER)
                (pure terror)
         ... Er... pain.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Torture him... you see, it makes
         no difference.

         You will all be tortured. You will
         all tell me all you know about
         Robin Hood, and then you will all
         be hanged. Then we will catch your
         beloved Robin Hood and do the same
         to him.
                       WILL SCARLET
         I will kill him for you.
                          WULF
         Will, no!
Nottingham strides up to Will, drawing his sword.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Why would I need you?
                       WILL SCARLET
         All your attempts to kill him
         have failed. Your army failed.
         Your Celtic mercenaries failed.
Nottingham places his sword point against Will's throat.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         And you can succeed?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I am one of his men. He would
         never suspect me.
                       WULF
         He knows you always hated him,
         traitor.

                       WILL SCARLET
         He is a trusting fool. He will
         believe me. If he doesn't, he
         will kill me and you have lost
         nothing.
Nottingham slides his blade between Will's teeth.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         If you fail, I will personally
         cut out your lying tongue.
He withdraws the blade.    Will tries to smile.
                       WILL SCARLET
         And if I succeed?
                                            (CONTINUED)

         His friends will..
                (to a guard)
         ... torture him!
He turns back to Will.   A smile of mock apology.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         It will look better.

EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - NIGHT
A winter's night. Bitterly    cold.  Sad figures huddled
around a small fire. Fanny    tends to John's wounds, their
little ones asleep by their   feet.  John drinks and passes
the jug to Tuck, who numbly   shakes his head. Too
depressed even to drink.
Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who
sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
                       ROBIN
         My pride brought us to this.
                       ASLAN
         No, friend. It was you who gave
         these men pride.
                       ROBIN
         I gave them nothing but false
         hope. Tomorrow we will disperse.
         These people can move south and
         start over. You must go home and
         win your Jasmina.

                         ASLAN
         And you?
                       ROBIN
         I am no longer your responsibility.
                       ASLAN
         That is for me to decide.
                       ROBIN
                (raging)
         Damn you, Arab. I want you out of
         my life. Can't you understand
         that? Go home. Go back to your
         own kind.
Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for
argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips
it from his neck.

                       ROBIN
         Damn you, too, Father.   You reared
         a coward and a fool.
He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging
branch.
                                            CUT TO:

NOVEMBER MOON
Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion,
dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees
before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white
moon against the black sky...
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

ITS NEGATIVE IMAGE
-- a black circle against a white sky. An executioner.
The round medallion has become a noose.
In the noose appears Wulf's face. The executioner hauls
on the rope and Wulf's features contort in the agony of
death. Another noose, another face... Duncan. Another
-- Bull. Another -- Marian.
                       MARIAN
         Kiss me, Robin.
The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face
shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna.

Next, Robin's father.   He stares accusingly right AT us.
                       LOCKSLEY
         Why have you betrayed me?   Why?
Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his
hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope.
His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous
cacophony.
                                            DISSOLVE TO:

ROBIN'S FACE
DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of
a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away
the horror.

CONTINUED:
The first streaks of light fight their way through a
thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure,
at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence,
Robin looks up.
                         ROBIN
         Will!    I thought you were taken.
                         WILL SCARLET
         I was.
                       ROBIN
         How did you escape?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I promised to kill you.
                         ROBIN
         And will you?
Before Will can answer, Little John runs up.     Grabs
Will's throat.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will
         Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a
         bloody favor an' all.
Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with
kids clinging to her skirts.
                       FANNY
         Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im
         if Wulf be still alive.
Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold
just enough for Will to splutter out...
                         WILL SCARLET
         Y... e...
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put
         the bleedin' weasel outa 'is
         misery.
                         ROBIN
         John, wait.    Let us hear what he
         has to say.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff,
         'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin'

         A traitor sneaks in and out under
         cover of darkness. Will walked in
         and announced himself.
                         LITTLE JOHN
                  (dismissive)
         Aye.    'E always did 'ave balls o'
         brass.

         Let's sss... string 'im up.
                       ROBIN
         Let him speak.

John reluctantly moves his hold from Will's neck to his
shoulders.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a
         bloody blade on 'im somewheres.
Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's
shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and
fresh burns.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Bugger me.
He steps back.    Ready to listen.
                       WILL SCARLET
         I bring a message from Nottingham.
         Our men are to be hung in the
         square on Saturday. At high noon.

                       FANNY
         What about my boy?
                         WILL SCARLET
         The boy, too.    Ten men in all.
Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder.
                         WILL SCARLET
         Their   deaths are a warning.
         Anyone   who associates with the
         outlaw   Hood is to suffer the same
         fate.    Man, woman, or child. Even
         anyone   who so much as utters his
         name.

                       WILL SCARLET
         The hangings are to be part of the
         celebration for the Sheriff's
         marriage.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Marriage, eh? What lucky wench
         gits to play with the Sheriff's
         codpiece?
Will turns his gaze directly on Robin.

         Lady Marian.

         Aye, and then with King Richard
         gone, he takes the bloody throne.
Everyone reacts with shock.     Only Robin appears unsur-
prised.
                       ROBIN
         You were to use this news to get

EXT. NOTTINGHAM TOWN SQUARE - DUSK
Ten gallows, silhouetted against the setting sun. The
black-armored Celt tests a gallows, springing the hatch.
A heavy sack dangles from the rope. Grim-faced peasants
watch. Among  them -- Fanny Little.

The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone
walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings
in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light
high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He
fingers his wooden crucifix.

In the troubled human realm, Tuck says his morning
prayer.
                         FRIAR
           Lord, grant us the courage to
           endure, and if you're as smart as
           I believe you are, grant us
           victory... and the victuals to
           celebrate it with.

Aslan is crushing charcoal into a mixture of yellow
powder, which is turning black. Tuck approaches.
                         FRIAR
           Will you pray with me, son of
           Allah?
                         ASLAN
           I have prayed for you, often, my
           brother. But, let us put prayer
           aside and help our gods in a more
           practical manner. I must reveal
           to you the mysteries of the black
           powder.
Tuck takes a bowl of the powder close to the fire to
examine it. Aslan snatches it back... Before Tuck can
react, Robin walks up.

Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of
bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's
hand as he speaks.
                       ROBIN
         We have no armored knights, no

                         FANNY
         Seven!

She strides towards them from the trees.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         What in blazes ya doin', woman?
         Where's the little 'uns?
                       FANNY
         Them's safe, wi' my mother.
                (pushes past Little
                 John)
         Robin, I been to town an' seen the
         scaffold and the guard towers.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya gone bleedin' cracked, girl?
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      109.

                       FANNY
         You go an' birth eight babies and
         then you can come an' tell me
         'bout hurtin', ya big ox. I ain't
         gonna sit aroun' an' let one o'
         'em die, neither.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya should be bloody well mindin'
         the other seven. Tell 'er, Rob.
Robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a
stick.
                       ROBIN
         Fanny, show me the exact location
         of the scaffold.
Little John double-takes.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM - DAY
The gallows. Swathed in a pink glow. A brilliant,
wintry morning. Breath billows from the mouths of the
sentries.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DAY
Boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. The
Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters...

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY

... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul
things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet
unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked
by two armed guards.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         How is my bride?
Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his
face.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ah... You are overwhelmed with
         happiness.
He slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     110.
CONTINUED:
                       MARIAN
                (calm, uncowed)
         I will never marry you.
Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet
she used at the Druid ceremony.
                       MORTIANNA
         Hold her!
Marian struggles against her bonds.
                       MARIAN
         Get away from me, you disgusting
         hag. I will not... augh!

The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth
open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her
throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the
drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham
watches with amusement.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (to Mortianna)
         When we are married, thirty of the
         northern barons will pledge me
         their support as king. As you
         predicted.
Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood.
Clasps the dice-like runes.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         What do you see in the portents?
Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands
to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones.
                       MORTIANNA
         The union. The blood of the lion
         and the house of Nottingham. New
         faith. New power. New souls.
She stares at Nottingham, her red eyes demented.
                       MORTIANNA
         If there is no union, there will
         be darkness, despair, death.
         Ours!
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Di not give me riddles, woman. We
         are to be married within hours.
         How can we be in danger?
                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     111.

                       MORTIANNA
         The blood does not lie.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (shouting)
         Tell me how it will result.
                       MORTIANNA
         I have told you what I know.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Confound you, crone. Without my
         protection, the people would hunt
         you down, rip out your black heart
         and burn it.

Mortianna runs at him.   Points her bony finger at his
heart.
                       MORTIANNA
         Without me, you are nothing. You
         are straw, a fleabite, a speck.
                (as Nottingham
                 laughs)
         Laugh, fool. I birthed you from
         this body. I stole a babe in this
         very castle, and killed it so that
         you might rise in its place. You
         are my son.
                (Nottingham is
                 too shocked to
                 react)
         Together we are strong. Now is
         not the time to doubt. Now is the
         time to believe, to be bold. The
         bold will prevail.


EXT. CITY GATE - DAY
Masses stream in. They give wide berth to a Celtic war-
rior in a boar's head helmet. Soldiers prod and harness
the passing peasants. Tuck drives a cartload of barrels.
A GUARD stops him.
                       GUARD
         What you got there, Father?
                       FRIAR
         The Lord's finest brew for the
         good Nottingham's fighting men.
         It has a mighty kick.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                       GUARD
                (smiling)
         I'll warrant. Pass.

EXT. DUNGEON GATE - DAY
Wulf blinks at the sunlight as the prisoners are led out.
Holds his head high. Soldiers hurl abuse, the people are
too cowed to show support. Fanny glances at her son,
crosses herself and scurries into the castle, unnoticed.
On horseback, encircled by guards, the Sheriff and his
baron cronies watch the outlaws progress with cruel
amusement. A  yell attracts Nottingham. Will is being
shoved back by guards.
                      WILL SCARLET
         Sheriff! My Lord Sheriff! I have
         word for you! Of Robin Hood!
Nottingham shouts to one of his mounted guards, who rides
over, grabs Will by the collar, and drags him to his
side.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed?
                       WILL SCARLET
         I found his lair, but alas he still
         lives.
The Sheriff strikes down with his armored hand.    Will
crumples.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Stretch his neck with the others.
Hands yank Will to his feet. Dazed, he tries to speak.
Disinterested, Nottingham turns away, until he catches...
                       WILL SCARLET
         ...He... He... is here!
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Locksley, here? Where ?
Will struggles to get free of his holders.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Call off your dogs.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Release him!... Now, where is he?
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                       113.
CONTINUED:
                       WILL SCARLET
         I want your word, in front of
         these witnesses. If I tell you,
         I will go free.
                       NOTTINGHAM
                (scoffs)
         We will find him.
                       WILL SCARLET
         He is concealed. He is going to
         free the prisoners and stop the
         wedding.
Nottingham's jaw tightens.   Eyes the prisoners, the
scaffold.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Put Hood in my hands, you go free.
                       WILL SCARLET
         With the reward. Ten thousand
         crowns.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Damn your worthless hide!    Just
         tell me where he is.
                       WILL SCARLET
         The reward!
The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf
charges at him, screaming in blind rage. Soldiers grab
Wulf. Throw him down, kicking and beating. Voices in
the crowd plead to let him be. Someone tries to
intervene, gets hurled down.

                       NOTTINGHAM
                (to Will)
         You'll get your reward. Where
         is he?
                                             CUT TO:

EXT. SCAFFOLD
Tuck urges his ancient nag towards the scaffold with his
cargo of barrels. The crowd parts unwillingly.
                       FRIAR
         Out of the way. Make way for
         the Lord's business.

CONTINUED:
Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's
direction.

EXT. CITY WALL - DAY
A massive oak stands near the southern wall. A large
figure climbs to its uppermost branches. Little John.
He scrambles from the tree, starts to climb the wall
itself. He slips frequently.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
The prisoners are led to the scaffold, where the hooded
executioner waits, along with the Chieftain. Wulf
staggers, from his beating.
Nottingham's men encircle Tuck's cart.    He watches them
nervously.

EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
Fanny lowers a knotted rope over the battlement. Far
below, John clings to the outer wall. Above him it's
sheer, without footholds. The rope doesn't reach his
fingertips. He stretches, loses balance. Falls...
desperately grabbing at the rope. He swings, clinging
by one arm, his body smashing into the wall.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Will leads the Sheriff to Tuck's cart.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Step down, friar.
                       FRIAR
         As you wish, sire. Is there
         something amiss?
                       NOTTINGHAM
         This man claims you have outlaws
         concealed in these barrels. Among
         them the cursed Robin Hood.
Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred.
                       FRIAR
         This man will rot in hell as a
         knave and a liar. These are
         libations for the celebration
         of your lordship's nuptials.

                       NOTTINGHAM
         Break one open!
                       FRIAR
                (nervous)
         Why waste fine vintage, my lord?
A cask is shattered... wine torrents out.
                       WILL SCARLET
         Try another. There are many
         barrels, only a few outlaws.
A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the
scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the
steps -- Wulf.
Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes
a flame.

EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He
nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks
the man's view.
                       SENTRY
         What is your business, woman?
                       FANNY
         Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
         Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly
         view up 'ere, ain't it?
She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to
her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams
his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times.
He slumps unconscious.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the
noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who
is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head
bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree-
branch crutch.
                       WOUNDED SOLDIER
         Give room for a fightin' man and
         his ma. Step aside, or I'll make
         ya. I wanna see the bastards walk
         on air.

                                                       116.
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY
John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses.
                       FANNY
         'Bout time, ya gurt lug.
She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an
arrow.
                       FANNY
         We be too late.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain
guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround
the base.
The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose.
SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the
barrels.
A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow.
The executioner's eyes glint through the slits.
Nottingham intently watches Wulf.
The Chieftain stands, impassive.
Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns.
Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close.
An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye
slit.
The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but
the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap.
Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight.
Little John yells.   Fanny screams.
A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier
throws aside his crutch... Robin!
Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the
choking cord.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                      117.
CONTINUED:
The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the
smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting
it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his
effort to escape.
The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked...
by the Celt with the boar's head.
KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing
smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass
confusion.
Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's
rope. He hauls him onto the platform.

Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes
the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig...
It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his
arm.
                       HAL
         Here... By God... Let's fight 'em!
                      WOODSMAN
         Hal! What happened to your
         stutter?
                       HAL
         It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap!
A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
                       HAL
         Take that, ya mug.
No stutter this time!    The woodsmen join battle with the
guards.
The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head.
The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan.
                        CHIEFTAIN
         Impostor!   You dishonor the clan.
Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering
blows.

FROM PARAPET
John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch
Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him.
                         LITTLE JOHN
         Fight fair...

He aims.   Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a
shaft.
                         LITTLE JOHN
           ...Or don't fight at all.

ON SCENE
Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking
out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the
trap hole.
Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight
with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and
mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and
around the horse's legs.
Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at
his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood.
Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It
EXPLODES.
The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the
parapet.
                          GREYBEARD BARON
           Up there!   No mercy, shoot them!
Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.      Bolts ricochet
all around Little John and Fanny.

ON SCAFFOLD

Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.

ON SCENE
Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a
soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
armor.
The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his
horse. Will leaps on him.

                       WILL SCARLET
         Pain or death, you butcher?
The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him.
Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by
four men.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Here's another message to Robin
         Hood, written in your blood.
He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
belly.
                       WILL SCARLET
         It's over, fool. You can kill my
         body, but you cannot kill our
         spirit.
He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.
                        REDHEAD BARON
         It's Hood!   Get him!
The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword.
                        CHIEFTAIN
         I am iron.   I am rock. I am your
         death.
Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.
                       ASLAN
         You talk too much!
He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.
                       ASLAN
         Englishmen! I am not one of you,
         yet I fight for you. Against a
         tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin
         Hood.
The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen
soldiers, many join the fray.

Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants
pursue.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Lower the portcullis! Now!
A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him
aside.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Too slow, fool!
He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.

Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants
are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged off
and trampled down.
                        ROBIN
         Friends!   We must raise the gate.

EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY
Crossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while
spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both
sides.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers.
         Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies.
He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he
leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs
his sword.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind
         if I borrow this?
He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to
one.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
Robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis.
INT. CASTLE - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
The Sheriff marches through, issuing orders.

         your lives. ... Bring the bishop
         to my chapel.

INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY
Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a
mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway,
lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs
the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The
Sheriff's face appears in the reflection.
                        NOTTINGHAM
         Come!   It is time for the union.
The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet.    She is
oblivious.

INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed   to the
practice of black magic. The crucifix on the    altar is
upside down. Marian stands before it, between    the
Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged    in.
Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO.
                       BISHOP
         They are rebelling. We must
         escape.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Marry us. When I am declared king,
         that rabble will not dare go against
         us.
                       BISHOP
         Is is madness to delay.
Mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the
Bishop's outstretched hands. Blood flows.
                       MORTIANNA
         Face them, or face me.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY
Robin leaps onto Tuck's cart.

Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across
the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels.
FUSES smoke and CRACKLE.
                       ROBIN
         Jump!
Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the
last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the
horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is
blown to kingdom come.
Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger.
Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.


INT. CASTLE KITCHENS - DAY
Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier.
He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire.
Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the
head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at
Fanny with a knife.

EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY
Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More
peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated
men. Aslan's a whirlwind,  striking out in all
directions. Each blow for  a cause.
                       ASLAN
         For Allah!... For Jehovah!
         For brotherhood!... For
         justice!


INT. CASTLE HALLWAYS - DAY
A door SLAMS back. Robin bursts through. Alone, against
three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him
as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is
off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.
                       ROBIN
                (grabbing a servant)
         Where is she? Where is Lady
         Marian?

The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor,
sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door-
way.
                        ROBIN
         Ah!   There is my answer.
He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him.

INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage-
ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful
men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club.
                       FRIAR
                (pious)
         My son, there is a holy war being
         waged outside. Release all these
         wretches and God shall surely find
         you a place in heaven.
                       JAILER
         I'd rather go to hell!
WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
Flies back.

INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
                       BISHOP
         ...your bodies to be bound in
         immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian
         Dubois, take...
The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward.
Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
pew, taking down a third.
                        ROBIN
         Marian, run!   It's me, Robin.
         Run!
Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side.
Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the
Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin
prepares to fight him.
                                          (CONTINUED)

                       ROBIN
         I warned you, I would find you no
         matter what.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         No companions? No army? You rush
         to your death for the sake of a
         woman. Lust has turned you into a
         fool... Recognize this, Locksley?
He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix
sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         Appropriate I should use it to
         kill you with, don't you think?
He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire
in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying
desperately.

INT. DUNGEONS - DAY
Tuck picks himself up from the floor.    The jailer is
amazed.
                       FRIAR
         The Lord helps those who help
         themselves.
Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor
... and a miniature powder keg. He holds it to his
flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... Stupified,
the man catches the smoking bomb.

                       FRIAR
         Give my regards to the devil.
The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall.

EXT. PARAPET - DAY
John is in deep trouble, but undaunted.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         Ya gutless bloody sissies.
Someone attacks his assailants from the rear.    The tide
turns.

         ya.
Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet.

EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY

A crossbow bolt strikes Hal between his shoulder blades.
He falls. The Sheriff's soldiers are regaining the
advantage. The peasants are giving up, dropping their
weapons.
                        HAL
         No!   Fight on. Fight!
He sees a familiar pair of holy sandals marching towards
him. Tuck leading a barefoot army. Dozens of ragged
prisoners, armed with chains and torture implements.
                       FRIAR
         Sinners, beware! God's avengers
         are at hand.
Dying, Hal manages a weak smile.
                       HAL
         Go' bless ya, Tuck.

Tuck flails a chain at a Celt.
                       FRIAR
         Repent, heathen!
The man spins to strike back... freezes... grinning...
Aslan!

The chef raises his knife.    Fanny appeals to the whole

                (to the chef)
         Turn that on the Sheriff and his
         bullies.
A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding
cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying
food and cutlery.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY

A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the
fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants
and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms,
knives, hooks, and bedpans.

INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY
Nottingham slashes maniacally.   Robin is cornered,
weakening.
                       NOTTINGHAM
         You should have stayed away,
         Locksley. Fools like you never
         learn.
A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his
grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back
to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan,
followed by Tuck.

                         ASLAN
         Ali akbar!
                         FRIAR

                (seeing Aslan)
         Agh... the painted one!
Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops
down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the
floor.
Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other
men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall.
                                            (CONTINUED)

The Bishop makes his escape.    Tuck blocks his path.
                      FRIAR
         So! You sold your soul to the
         devil?
                       BISHOP
         No, I swear it, in God's name.
                       FRIAR
         Blasphemer! You accuse innocent
         men of Druid worship while you
         practice the black arts yourself.
The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.

A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on
Aslan.
                       ROBIN
                (glimpsing her)
         Watch out!
Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
the floor.
Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.

                       BISHOP
                (innocently)
         I am sure you would not strike a
         man of the cloth.
                        FRIAR
         Think again!
Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so
hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW.

EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY
Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers
down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice.

            What you fear is not below.
He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams
hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest.
Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all
reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it
further through her body in her effort to get at him.
Clutching, screeching, hissing.
Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the
last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle-
ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to
the ground.


INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY
Sword raised, Nottingham has Robin backed against the
altar.
                          NOTTINGHAM
            What can your puny God do for
            you now?
The blade comes whirring down... clang! It's blocked.
Robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
He swings it again, slamming Nottingham across the
temple.  The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
to squirm away.
                          ROBIN
            This is for my father.

He drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
Nottingham's heart. The man shudders, and is still.
Robin stands over him. Drained. Tuck rushes outside.
Kneels at Aslan's side. Robin spots Marian swaying on
the edge of the steep parapet.

EXT. CASTLE BALCONY - DAY
Robin grabs Marian, pulling her back. Carefully lifts
her face. Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. She lashes
out. A spitfire.

            Let me go!   Who are you?

         way I see fit.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY
Robin emerges from the castle. Draped over his shoulder,
Marian is kicking and beating at him. He reaches the
fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water.
She leaps to her feet, yelling. Slips and tumbles back.
Water streams from her bridal gown. A crowd gathers,
enjoying the show.
                        MARIAN
         Robin?   Oh God, is that you?
She stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
pounding her fists on his chest.
                       MARIAN
         How dare you?!
Robin grins at the crowd.
                       ROBIN
         I think she's feeling better.
Marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of
battle. Reality gradually sinks in. She folds against
Robin's chest.
Little John arrives, his huge arms enfolding Wulf and
Fanny.
                       LITTLE JOHN
         We done it, mate. We clobbered
         the buggers.

                         ROBIN
         It will mend.
He spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of
Aslan. His smile fades. He runs over. Cradles Aslan's
head.

         God's holy church, I now
         pronounce you husband and wife.
Tuck is performing the ceremony before the happy couple.
                       FRIAR
         You may kiss the bride.
The husband draws back the bride's veil.    Robin and
Marian. They kiss... long.
                      FRIAR
               (whispers)
         Hurry. We waste good celebration
         time.
They break   the embrace, turn to the congregation and
start down   the aisle. They pause at the front pew,
where KING   RICHARD and members of his court are sitting.
Robin bows,   Marian curtsies.
                       KING RICHARD
         May I kiss the bride?
                       ROBIN
         Who would dare refuse his king's
         request?
                       KING RICHARD
                (kissing Marian's
                 cheek)
         You look radiant, cousin.
                       ROBIN
         We are deeply honored by Your
         Majesty's presence.
                       KING RICHARD
         It is I who am honored, Lord
         Locksley. Thanks to you I still
         have a throne.
They continue down the aisle, past the smiling congre-
gation. Waiting by the door is Aslan. He and Robin
embrace.
                       ASLAN
                (whispers)
         My friend, a word of advice...
         Ride her better than your horse.
Robin laughs.

                                                      132.
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY
WEDDING BELLS PEAL. Robin and Marian step out into the
sunlight. The crowd cheers. At a signal from Little
John, the ex-outlaws shoot flaming arrows into the sky...
FIREWORKS...

                                          FADE OUT.




                        THE END

RING PRODUCTIONS, INC.

MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED:
 




INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"

... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
fighting.

In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a
plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.

The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is
hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.

The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
across the ring at Rocky.

				BLACK FIGHTER
			(to cornerman)
		... I'm gonna bust his head
		wide open!

In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.

				CORNERMAN
			(lackluster)
		... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
		suckers some action.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				CORNERMAN
			(overriding)
		Ya movin' like a bum -- Want
		some advice --

				ROCKY
		... Just gimme the water.
 

										2.


A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.

				FAN
		Should I bet the fight don't
		go the distance -- Ya feel
		strong?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CORNERMAN
		... Ya want some good advice?

				ROCKY
		... I just want the mouthpiece.

The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The
fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in
a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.

Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into
the ring.  Rocky ignores it.

The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does
not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new
fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."

				ANNOUNCER
		Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
		six rounder between local
		lightweights.

Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up
the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.

THE TITLE CREDITS END:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
 

										3.


				FIGHTER #1
		... Tomorrow me an' my woman
		are gonna tip on down to
		Atlantic City, man.

				FIGHTER #2
		... It's cold, Bro'.

				FIGHTER #1
		... That's right, I got the
		city to myself...

Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
spit nervously on the floor.

A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
that is BLASTING MUSIC.

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
are smoking.  The room is cloudy.

A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater
buttoned over a t-shirt.

				PROMOTER
		...Balboa!?

Rocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.

				PROMOTER
			(continuing)
		... Twenty bucks for the
		locker an' cornerman -- Two
		bucks for the towel an'
		shower, seven for tax -- The
		house owes ya, sixty-one
		dollars.

The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.

INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT

Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
self-conscious.

				ROCKY
			(almost apologetic)
		I'm a fighter.
 

										4.


				WOMAN
			(tired)
		... Yo' iz an accident.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.

Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
bookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.

Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to
the dog and continues to the corner.

EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
in the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away
the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
enters.

INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

The narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light
bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a
curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is
used as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.

Rocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of
glasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
creatures.

				ROCKY
		...Look who's home.

Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The
record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."

... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.

The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
 

										5.


EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN

We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
sits majestically above City Hall...

EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING

Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
over one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.

Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
car.  These men look like blood drinkers.

				MAFIA #1
		Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss?

				ROCKY
		Real good.

				MAFIA #2
		Fightin' again?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, here an' there.

				MAFIA #1
		Mebbe we make sum money
		togather soon... Give ya boss
		my best.

Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
the crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
crane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the
gangplank.

INT. SHIP - DAY

The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
crates and coffee beans.

Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.

				FATS
			(terror-filled)
		Don't hit the face!  Not the
		face!!

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo wants the two
		hundred now!
 

										6.


				FATS
		Honest to God I'm broke --
		Gimme a break.

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo says I should get
		two hundred or break the thumb.

				FATS
		Please, I need my hands to
		work -- Christ, don't bust my
		thumbs.

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
stevedores.  Rocky remains cool.

				ROCKY
		Goin' fishin'?

The man drops the hook.

				ROCKY
		What's ya name again?

				FATS
		Bob.

				ROCKY
		Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
		ya gotta pay the band -- If ya
		borrow, ya gotta pay the man...
		Me, I ain't emotionally
		involved.

Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man
quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
wad of bills.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; counting)
		A hundred an' thirty.

				FATS
		That's it, I'm broke.

				ROCKY
		That's it? -- Completely?

				FATS
		That's it.

				ROCKY
		What about for food an' stuff?
 

										7.


				FATS
		You have my food in ya hand.

Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
flushed expression.

				ROCKY
		... The juice is climbin'
		every week.

				FATS
		I know the juice is climbin' --
		I been workin' six months just
		to pay the damn interest.

				ROCKY
		Ya still light seventy.

				FATS
		Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't
		have to break nothin' -- Here,
		take my coat, it's worth
		fifty-sixty dollars.  It's
		yours.

The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...

				FATS
			(continuing)
		See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
		don't have to know nuthin'.
		I'll go tape up the hand like
		ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo
		won't be wise to nothin' -- Be
		a smart guy, keep the coat,
		we'll fake like ya broke the
		hand.

The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
man's thumb and bends him to his knees.

				FATS
			(almost a whisper)
		No - no - no - Please -
		Please - Please don't...

Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The
thumb is fine.

				ROCKY
		...That's what coulda happened.
			(walks off.)
 

										8.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In
the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the
window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and
presses his face against the window and does his impression
of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks
away.

The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not
very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.
Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.

INT. PET SHOP - DAY

				ADRIAN
		... Could you take the puppy
		out --

				CUSTOMER
		It can breathe.

				ADRIAN
		Please -

				CUSTOMER
		Please, nothin' - I paid for
		this dog and can do whatever I
		want with it - I can throw it
		through the window if I want -
		Now give me my two dollars
		back before I do throw it
		through the window.

Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it
to Adrian.

				CUSTOMER
		Get away from me - Give me that!

Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
to the lady... She nervously exits.

				ROCKY
		... How's the turtle food this
		week?
 

										9.


				ADRIAN
		... Fine.

				ROCKY
		Me, I'm kinda aggravated.

				ADRIAN
		... I'm sorry.

				ROCKY
		Ain't your fault - Here's the
		problem.

Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.

				ROCKY
		The last food I got here had
		more moths than flies -- An'
		the moths get caught in my
		turtle's throat -- That makes
		them cough --

The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
waves at Rocky.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
		about the turtle food -- Like
		I was sayin', the moths get
		caught in the turtle's throat
		an' makes 'em cough...
			(coughs)
		A little cough an' I gotta
		smack 'em on the shell -- An'
		whatta think they get?

Adrian shrugs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I smack 'em hard on the shell
		an' they get... What?

				ADRIAN
		... I don't know.

				ROCKY
		Shell-shocked!

Both the Owner and Adrian smile.
 

									10.


				OWNER
		Startin' with the bad jokes
		early today, huh.

				ROCKY
		Inventin' jokes ain't easy.

Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
Inside is a huge dog.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How's Butkus this mornin'?

				OWNER
		Ain't had time to check 'em.

Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
very happy.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

The dog plays dead.

				ROCKY
		...What kinda dog is this again?

				OWNER
		Bullmastiff.

				ROCKY
		The owner was suppose to pick
		him up three weeks ago.

				OWNER
		We're not responsible for
		animals left over thirty
		days - We board it ain't a
		animal shelter, Y'know.
		...Adrian, I want you to clean
		all those cat cages downstairs,
		they're a mess.
			(Adrian nods.)


Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.

EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY

Gazzo picks up Rocky.
 

									11.


INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
Rocky is in the back seat.

				ROCKY
		He only had a hundred an'
		thirty. -- I think he's good
		for the rest next week, Mr.
		Gazzo.

				GAZZO
			(patiently)
		Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for
		it...

Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty.

				GAZZO
		Tomorrow collect from Del
		Rio -- He's late three weeks.
		How'd you do last night?

				ROCKY
		... Fine.

Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
mirror and smiles.

				BODYGUARD
		Did ya get the license number?

				ROCKY
		Of wa?

				BODYGUARD
		... Of the truck that run over
		your face.

Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.

				GAZZO
		Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job
		this mornin?  How come ya
		didn't break this guy's thumb
		like I asked ya?  When ya
		don't do what ya are told, it
		makes me look bad, kid.

				ROCKY
		I figure if I break the thumb
		this guy gets thrown outta his
		job and can't pay nothin no
		more.
 

									12.


				GAZZO
		It don't matter.  It's my
		reputation.  These guys think
		they can get off light.  It's
		bad for my reputation -- It's
		bad for business.  See ya
		killer.

Gazzo gets into his car.

				GAZZO
			(to Bodyguard)
		... The Rock's a good kid.

				BODYGUARD
			(emotionless)
		... A meatbag.

They pull away.

EXT. GYM - DAY

Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar
people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is
apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
and mentally defective.

				RUDY
		...See the fight last night?

				RUDY
		Nah, I was fightin' myself.

				RUDY
		Apollo Creed beat the bum to
		pieces.

EXT./INT. GYM - DAY

Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.

Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The
MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
 

									13.


The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
wave and yell greetings.

				FIGHTER #1
		Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
		Rice out in the sixth?

				ROCKY
		The third -- Shoulda seen it.

Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.

				FIGHTER #2
			(removes glove)
		Hey, Rock, touch my hand.

				ROCKY
		How come?

				FIGHTER #2
		C'mon, it's important.

Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.

				FIGHTER #2
			(continuing)
		Can ya tell I just whacked-off?

Rocky smiles and moves away.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden
benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that
reads, "NO KISSING."

Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no
luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
situation.

After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is
taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.

				ROCKY
			(mumbling)
		... These ain't my clothes.
 

									14.


He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
of the door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... These ain't my pictures.

A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks
like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is
MIKE.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'
		here?

				MIKE
		It ain't your locker no more.

				ROCKY
		Whatta ya talkin' about it
		ain't my locker no more?

				MIKE
		Listen, I'm with you -- But ya
		gotta talk to Mickey -- I put
		ya stuff in the bag over there.

Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up.

				FIGHTER
		...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
		soap, Man.

				MIKE
			(irate)
		Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
		Nobody -- You don't call me
		Peanut.

				FIGHTER
		Peanut, gimme some soap.

The fighters laugh.  Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter.  It
hits just above the man's head.  The fighters are shocked
into silence.

Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
loudly in Spanish.
 

									15.


INT. GYM - DAY

Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
training routines.

				ROCKY
		You were ready to bite that
		guy's face.

				MIKE
		Yeah -- See the fight last
		night?  Apollo Creed beat that
		English guy bad.

				ROCKY
		Creed's great.

Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
another chore...

INT. GYM - DAY

The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He
wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.

Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what nobody says,
		this bum Creed woulda never
		made it in the Thirties --

				ROCKY
		Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

				MICKEY
			(monotoned)
		... What?

				ROCKY
		I said, how ya feelin'?

				MICKEY
			(dryly)
		Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?

				ROCKY
			(low)
		Yeah.
 

									16.


				MICKEY
			(spitting)
		Then stand there an' wait till
		I'm done -- Creed's good,
		yeah, he's real fine but I
		gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
		who's got the stuff it takes
		to be a champ -- He's mean,
		quick, an' big -- What more
		d'ya need?  Okay, go to work...
			(to Rocky)
		Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

				ROCKY
		I was talkin' with ya man,
		Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
		put outta my locker?

				MICKEY
		Dipper needed it.

Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Dipper's a climber -- You're a
		tomato.

				ROCKY
		... Tomato?

				MICKEY
		Facts is facts.  I run a
		business here -- I'm cleanin'
		house --

Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		How old are ya?

				ROCKY
		...What?

				MICKEY
		How old?

				ROCKY
		Come July, twenty-five.
 

									17.


				MICKEY
		More like thirty.

				ROCKY
		Twenty-five, thirty -- What's
		the difference? -- It took me
		two months to learn the
		combination of that locker.

				MICKEY
		The legs must be goin'.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, they're goin', -- that's
		nature... That was my locker
		for six years.

				MICKEY
		... Did ya fight last night?

				ROCKY
		Yeah --

				MICKEY
		Did ya win?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, Kayo.

				MICKEY
		... Who'd ya fight?

				ROCKY
		Spider Rice.

				MICKEY
		Rice is a bum.

				ROCKY
		You think everybody I fight is
		a bum.

				MICKEY
		Ain't they?

Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.
 

									18.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya want the truth -- Ya got
		heart, but ya fight like an
		ape -- The only thing special
		about you is ya never got ya
		nose broke -- keep ya nose
		pretty -- what's left of ya
		brain an' retire.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Did good last night --
		Shoulda seen it.

				MICKEY
		Hey, ever think about retirin'?

				ROCKY
		...No.

				MICKEY
		Think about it.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, sure.

Shrugging, Rocky moves away.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		...I think I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Shoulda seen me
		fight -- Did good, y'know.

Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.

				MICKEY
			(gesturing
			towards Rocky)
		Known him since he was
		fifteen -- A waste of life.

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big
Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of
water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.

				DIPPER
			(to Rocky)
		... I dig yo' locker, Man.

				TRAINER
		Time, Dipper.
 

									19.


Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on
Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off.

EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK

At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet
shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a
bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone.

INT. PET SHOP - DUSK

Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She
hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters.

				ROCKY
		... Wow -- cold!  Good night
		to catch pneumonia.

Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky
fumbles idly among the pet toys.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Ah -- I came in here for
		somethin'... Oh, yeah, would
		ya like somebody to walk ya
		home?

The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority
complex will not permit it... Rocky understands.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Hey, how's my buddy doin'?
			(looks into
			Butkus' cage)
		-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
		ya later.

				ADRIAN
		... Goodnight, Rocky.

Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed
emotions.

EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws
the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter
can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George
Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption
reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!"
 

									20.


INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

Rocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth...
Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer
in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone.

				ROCKY
		Catch pneumonia out there --
		Seen Paulie?

Andy casually nods towards the men's room.

Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on
the bar.

INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT

Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square
shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic
misanthrope.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(very drunk)
		Yo, Rocky -- Look at this
		mirror.  I'd like to kill the
		friggin' moron who broke this
		mirror.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Your sister's givin' me the
		shoulder.

				PAULIE
		Forget her.  You could do
		better than my sister.

				ROCKY
		Every mornin', every night I
		pass by -- I smile.
				(MORE)
 

									21.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She
		looks at me.

				PAULIE
			(annoyed)
		Looks, huh?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, like I was a plate of
		leftovers -- Somethin' wrong
		with my face -- Whatta I need,
		a Caddy to connect with ya
		sister?

				PAULIE
		My sister's a friggin' loser.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				PAULIE
		Sometimes she gets me so
		crazy, I'd like to split her
		head with a razor.

				ROCKY
		Don't get mental, man.

				PAULIE
		Ya caught me in a bad mood.

				ROCKY
		Ya always in a bad mood --

				PAULIE
		... Adrian ain't sharp.

The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
with the neckline of his t-shirt.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		She's a loser -- She don't
		enjoy life -- She reads --
		Brainy -- Pushin' thirty
		friggin' years old!  She's
		gonna die alone if she don't
		wise up.

				ROCKY
		I'm thirty myself.
 

									22.


				PAULIE
		An' you're dyin' alone, too.

				ROCKY
		I don't see no crowd around
		you, neither.

				PAULIE
			(pointing at
			the wall)
		I wanna kill the friggin'
		moron who broke the mirror.

				ROCKY
		Let's get outta this stink.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

The restroom door opens.  Rocky guides Paulie out.  Though
stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks.

				PAULIE
		The girl's dryin' up!  She's
		gotta live a little before her
		body dries up!!  You're a pal,
		Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
		her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
		tomorrow.

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				PAULIE
		Tomorrow you come for some
		bird, right?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely...

Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
to the bar.  Andy leans over to him.

				ANDY
		That was alotta crap to go
		through for a dinner invite.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
CREED.  Creed is twenty-eight years old.  He is a tall,
smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
colored face...
 

									23.


He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and
cornermen.  Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers
disembark a private jet.

				COMMENTATOR
		How was the flight, Champ?

				APOLLO
		Very high an' very fast.

Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he
says.

				COMMENTATOR
		Apollo, how would you rate
		this last British challenger,
		Henry Wilcoxson?

				APOLLO
		He was big, an' very nasty so
		I destroyed him in a hurry --
		Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac
		Lee Green next month.

				COMMENTATOR
		You're referring to the much
		publicized bicentennial fight?

				APOLLO
		That's right -- It's gonna be
		the greatest sportin' event in
		this country's history -- A
		gala occurrence!

				COMMENTATOR
		Still to be held in
		Philadelphia?

				APOLLO
		The Bicentennial Heavyweight
		Championship of the World is
		gonna be held in the only
		place it can be held --
		Philadelphia! -- the nation's
		cradle -- January First -- the
		first major event of our two
		hundredth year.

				COMMENTATOR
		Where're you off to now?

Apollo draws his wife close.
 

									24.


				APOLLO
		Me an' my wife are goin' home
		'cause we miss our children
		an' can't go no more time
		without seein' them.

				COMMENTATOR
		Any quick advice for young
		boxing hopefuls?

				APOLLO
			(looks straight
			into the camera)
		... Stay in school an' use
		your brains, dig -- Be a
		lawyer, be a doctor, carry a
		leather briefcase an' forget
		about sports!!  Sports can
		only make ya grunt an' smell --
		Be a thinker not a stinker!!

Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator
faces the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		Jerry Simpson at Kennedy
		Airport with the Champion,
		Apollo Creed.

The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at
the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking
the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.

				ANDY
		Nobody cares what's happenin'
		in the world of sports
		nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,
		downhill -- Basketball,
		downhill.  Football's goin',
		too.  Bank on it.  Baseball
		use to be America's best
		sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like
		squattin' through a great
		double header, but now
		baseball's all business.

The news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks.

				ANDY
			(continuing)
		Where are the real fighters?
		The pros.  Today we jig clowns.
 

									25.


				ROCKY
		Clown.

				ANDY
		Yeah.

				ROCKY
		He took his best shot an'
		became champ -- What shot did
		you ever take?

				ANDY
		Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with
		yourself?  Fine.  But me, I
		gotta business here -- I don't
		need to take no shot.

Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie
slumped unconscious in the booth.

Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers.

				ANDY
			(continuing; boldly)
		Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,
		I'll take a shot!

Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window
hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be
out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to
Rocky.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(aggressively)
		Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

				ROCKY
		... No wine -- Bad for ya'
		brain.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		C'mon, man, it's cold, man.

				ROCKY
		No wine.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
 

									26.


				ROCKY
		Why?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(sarcastically)
		'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
		a dollar.

				ROCKY
		No dollar.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Hey, give Rocky a dime.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		... How come?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		So he can call all his friends.

				ROCKY
			(mildly embarrassed)
		... That's an old one.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.

				ROCKY
		Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya
		brother know you're hangin'
		out so late?

The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
to impress her friends.

				MARIE
		... Screw you.

				ROCKY
			(awed)
		What'd you say?

				MARIE
		... Screw you, yoyo.

The gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.

				ROCKY
		Did these guys teach you to
		talk dirty?  Huh?
 

									27.


				MARIE
		Hey --

				ROCKY
		What?

				MARIE
		Stuff it, man!

				ROCKY
			(shakes her)
		Don't you never say that --
			(to the gang)
		-- You guys talk like that in
		front of a little girl -- You
		guys are scum.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		This is our place, dig!

The gang reluctantly backs up a step.

				ROCKY
		Don't ya never come round this
		girl -- Go home.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		This is our corner, man!  You
		go, chump!

Rocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(backpedaling)
		We'll kill you, man -- We
		gotta gun.

				ROCKY
		Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
		ya face!

Rocky leads the girl away.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently
cutting through a dark public school yard.  They pass
through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights
located at the top of the school building.  The atmosphere
is somewhat eerie.
 

									28.


				ROCKY
		How come ya wanna hang out
		with those guys?  They teach
		ya bad things.

				MARIE
		I like 'em.  If you don't you
		can f--

				ROCKY
		Hey!  When I was your age,
		there was only one girl who
		talked like that in the whole
		neighborhood.

				MARIE
			(bored)
		... Yeah.

She attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly
tosses it to the ground.

				ROCKY
		Make your teeth yella --

				MARIE
		I like yella teeth.

				ROCKY
		Makes your breath like garbage.

				MARIE
		Maybe I like garbage.

Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.

				ROCKY
		Nobody likes garbage --
		Anyway, this girl with the
		dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
		but the guys wouldn't take her
		out for any serious datin'.

				MARIE
		Why?

				ROCKY
		'Cause that's the way guys
		are -- They laugh when ya talk
		dirty.  They think ya cute for
		a while, but then ya getta
		reputation an' watch out.
				(MORE)
 

									29.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		Nobody's ever gonna take ya
		serious.  Ya get no respect...
		I gotta use a bad word --
		Whore.  You'll end up maybe
		becomin' a whore.

				MARIE
		C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve.

				ROCKY
		That doesn't matter -- You
		don't really have to be a
		whore, just act like one an'
		that's it.

				MARIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
		years from now people will say
		'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
		who was she?' 'She was that
		little whore who hung out at
		the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
		now I remember!'... See, they
		don't remember you, they
		remember the rep.

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light
from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.

The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
away.

Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.

				ROCKY
			(points down
			the block)
		... That's your house, ain't it?

Marie nods.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Listen, I hope ya don't --
 

									30.


				MARIE
		I won't.

				ROCKY
		What was I gonna say?

				MARIE
		Ya hope I don't keep acting
		like a whore or I'll turn into
		one, right?

				ROCKY
		Ya, somethin' like that.

They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made
an impact on her life.

				MARIE
		Goodnight, Rocky.

				ROCKY
		'Night, Marie.

She takes a few more steps and pauses again.

				MARIE
		... Fuck you, Creepo!!!

The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay.

				ROCKY
			(walks off)
		... Yeah, who're you to give
		advice, Creepo.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

APOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the
offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter
looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo
Creed.

				LAWYER
		Are the doctor's reports
		confirmed?

				JERGENS
		Definitely --
			(reading)
		-- It says here, Mac Lee Green
		has suffered a seriously
		cracked third metacarpal in
		his left hand.
 

									31.


				APOLLO
		Damn.

				JERGENS
		I suppose we could cancel the
		fight indefinitely if you are
		set on fighting Green.

				TRAINER
		It ain't just Green, what
		about the time Apollo's
		invested --

				JERGENS
		I believe we can find a
		solution.

				APOLLO
		Solution, nothin' -- What
		about the Bicentennial fight.

				LAWYER
		Jergens, don't play games with
		my client!  Apollo has already
		done nearly a million dollars
		worth of publicity --

				TRAINER
		Ten million's worth!

				LAWYER
		-- And has made contractual
		obligations with over twenty
		different organizations -- He
		doesn't want to be embarrassed.

				APOLLO
		You best find me another
		ranked contender an' I mean in
		a flash, man!

				JERGENS
			(holding up
			some notes)
		I contacted Ernie Roman's
		manager, he's fighting in
		France the same week.

				APOLLO
		Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's
		ranked fifth.
 

									32.


				JERGENS
		Shaw's fighting in South
		America -- Why not postpone
		the bout until July Fourth?

				LAWYER
		Hell with Fourth of July, man!
		Ten thousand things'll be
		goin' down on the Fourth of
		July! -- Apollo wants to be
		first!

				JERGENS
		That may not be possible, Jimmy.

				TRAINER
		This man here is the Star,
		dig -- Don't cause him to
		breathe heavy -- Now what
		'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes?

				JERGENS
		Went to California and gained
		fifty pounds -- and I called
		every worthwhile contender,
		but they say five weeks isn't
		enough time to get in shape.

Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it.

				APOLLO
		Shape, nothin' -- They're
		afraid.  They know everybody
		in the world's gonna see this
		fight an' none of them gotta
		prayer of beating me so
		they're makin' excuses so they
		don't have to be the chump
		that's gonna be whipped in
		front of the whole civilized
		world!!

				JERGENS
		Apollo, I'm sure there's a way
		to salvage this.

				TRAINER
		Nobody wants to be dissected
		on the country's birthday.
 

									33.


				JERGENS
		All I can counter with is that
		I'm a goddamn good promoter --
		I've promoted in every country
		in the world -- and I've tried
		to the best of my abilities.
		Perhaps you're right, and no
		one wants to be beat on the
		country's birthday... I don't
		know what else to say --

				APOLLO
		I do -- Maybe what this fight
		needs is something new -- a
		novelty.

				TRAINER
		You's the novelty, Champ!

				APOLLO
		Give my main man a raise!!

Everyone laughs.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now here's what's goin' down.
		Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say
		this but one time.  On January
		first, the first day of the
		Bicentennial I'm gonna fight
		me a local poor underdog, dig?
		A snow-white underdog.  An'
		I'm gonna put his face on this
		poster with me, hear?  An'
		I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm
		sentimental -- An' all the
		people in the country all
		sentimental, man, an' they'd
		like nothin' better than me,
		Apollo Creed, to let some
		unknown get a shot at the
		greatest title in the world on
		this country's biggest birthday.
		Now that's the way I see it
		an' that's the way I want it!!

				JERGENS
		... It's very American.

				APOLLO
		No, man, it's very smart.
 

									34.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Late that afternoon Mr. Gazzo's white 1970 Cadillac pulls up
to Rocky's apartment... Rocky is in the back seat with the
loan shark.  Gazzo's bodyguard is driving.

Gazzo flips through a small black notepad.

				ROCKY
		Next Wednesday I grab a grand
		from Snyder.  An' Thursday two
		yards from Cappoli, okay?

				GAZZO
		No, two yards from Snyder, an'
		a grand from Cappoli.

				ROCKY
		Ya sure?

				GAZZO
		Hey, screw ya brain on right.
		Now, who's this girl you're
		going out with tonight?

				ROCKY
		How'd you know?

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		You think I don't hear things?

				ROCKY
		Paulie's sister.

				BODYGUARD
			(abrasively)
		Hear she's retarded.

				ROCKY
			(dryly)
		She ain't retarded, she's shy.

				BODYGUARD
		Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards
		like the zoo.

				ROCKY
		Does that bum have to say that?

The Bodyguard reddens... Gazzo motions to his Bodyguard to
relax.
 

									35.


				GAZZO
		Buddy's in a bad mood --
		prostate problems.

				ROCKY
		He's always in a bad mood.
			(laughs)
		Count ya blessin's.  Ya a
		healthy person -- ya legs
		work -- ya hands work --

The Bodyguard has been looking at Rocky with murderous eyes.

				BODYGUARD
		I don't like ya face.

				ROCKY
		Don't like yours neither.

				BODYGUARD
		Kiss my ass.

				ROCKY
		Move your shoulders down.

Mr. Gazzo is amused.  He steps out of the car, followed by
Rocky.

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Buddy's got a thing against
		ya, Rock.  Some people just
		hate for no reason, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.

				GAZZO
		Here's fifty bucks -- You an'
		the girl have a nice time.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.

Rocky enters his apartment and Gazzo drives off.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

The SCENE REVERTS BACK TO Miles Jergens' office.  Apollo
pores over a large record book.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Billy Snow?
 

									36.


				JERGENS
		Fouls.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?

				TRAINER
		Too old, dull fighter.
			(points at a name)
		Bobby Judge is a good boy.

				APOLLO
		... I don't feel heat from the
		name.

				JERGENS
		Joe Zack is a good prospect --
		Exciting boy.

				APOLLO
		... Still don't feel no heat.

				JERGENS
			(sighs)
		Exactly what are you looking
		for, Apollo?

				APOLLO
		... This man.

Everybody leans forward.

				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			much amused)
		'The Italian Stallion' -- He's
		my man.

				JERGENS
		Rocky Balboa -- His record's
		poor --

				APOLLO
		Don't matter -- That name.
		'The Italian Stallion,' it's
		right on.
			(laughs)
		Who discovered America?  An
		Italian, right?  So, man, what
		could be better than to get it
		on with one of his ancestors --

				TRAINER
		He won't last one round.
 

									37.


				APOLLO
		Listen, I gonna carry this boy
		three rounds, then drop 'im
		like a bad habit.

				TRAINER
		I don't like you messin' with
		southpaws -- They do everything
		wrong.

				APOLLO
		Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop
		'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed
		meets the Italian Stallion.'
		Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn
		monster movie!!

Everyone laughs.

						FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - DUSK

Rocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is
cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of
half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.)

				ROCKY
			(mimes throwing)
		I usta be deadly at half-ball.

				PAULIE
		I hate the friggin' game...
		I'd like to talk some business.

				ROCKY
		What kinda business?

				PAULIE
		Look at my hands -- See how
		the joints are swollen.

Paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in
		an' out of a freezer carryin'
		meat plays hell on the joints.

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya should see a doctor.
 

									38.


				PAULIE
		I don't need a doctor, I need
		a different job.

				ROCKY
		Maybe another job is the best
		thing.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo.
		Tell him I'm a friend an'
		would do a good job... Tell
		him I ain't bothered by
		nothin' an' would be a great
		collector... Bustin' bones
		don't bother me -- Tell him
		I'm a good worker.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you.

				PAULIE
		I'm askin' ya to go to him --
		As a favor.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you --
		Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job --
		Do what you do now.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK

They continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group
of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front.

Rocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the
night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky.

Marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the
opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch
quarters.

Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.

				PAULIE
		You know her?

Rocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night
air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS.

EXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a
dimly-lit four story walk-up.
 

									39.


				ROCKY
		Ya sister knows I'm comin'?

				PAULIE
		Yeah, sure -- She's very
		excited.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky
stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen.
A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on.

She stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled
by Rocky's unexpected presence.

				ADRIAN
			(weakly)
		Paulie, you're late.

She looks at Rocky again.

				PAULIE
		Did you call the hospital?
			(to Rocky)
		If I'm ten minutes late, she
		calls the hospital.

Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie
follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears.

OVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from
the TELEVISION.

				COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
		... Unfortunate luck for
		fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac
		Lee Green.  The slugging
		fighter acquired a serious
		fracture in his left hand
		after an aggressive day of
		sparring -- Champion Apollo
		Creed says he'll be 'shopping
		for another victim,' to fill
		Green's vacancy for the
		Bicentennial Championship
		Fight to be held in Philly
		next month... By the way,
		rumor has it that this will be
		the most widely-viewed sporting
		event in the entire world --
		and that includes the Super
		Bowl, folks... Today U.S.
		swimmers set a new...
 

									40.


Meanwhile, the argument between brother and sister continues
in the bedroom.

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie, why didn't you
		tell me you were bringing him
		home?!  Look at me, I'm not
		ready for this.

				PAULIE
		Like it would make a difference
		if you were, right?  This
		guy's a friend and now he's
		takin' ya out.

				ADRIAN
		No... I can't!

				PAULIE
		Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom
		an' I don't wanna know from
		nothin'.

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, please --

				PAULIE
		Hey, I want ya out
		instamaticly. -- I'm sicka
		lookin' at ya hangin' around
		like a friggin' spider -- Go
		out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life.

				ADRIAN
		... Like you?

				PAULIE
		Don't get wise with me.  I
		want ya to stop bein' a loser.

				ADRIAN
		I can't go out.

				PAULIE
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
		I've gotta turkey in the oven.

Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom... He enters the kitchen.
Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the
turkey... With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork,
Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window.
 

									41.


Adrian has seen this and is shattered.  She runs back into
the bedroom and locks the door.

				PAULIE
		!! Ya want the bird, go out in
		the alley an' eat the bird --
		I want ya outta the house --
		Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya
		hungry, Rock?

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Forget nothin' -- Here, talk
		to my sister, tell 'er
		somethin' nice.

Rocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking
to the enclosed girl.

				ROCKY
		... Yo, Adrian, it's me,
		Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's
		kinda hard for me to think of
		somethin' to say, y'know --
		'Cause I never talked to a
		door before, I mean whatta ya
		say to a door.

Rocky turns away and begins to walk off.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Maybe I better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Try again, c'mon, try again.

Rocky goes over to the door and begins speaking again.

				ROCKY
		Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't
		too happy at this moment, but
		would ya do me a favor -- I
		ain't got nobody to spend
		Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout
		you an' me goin' out -- Get
		somethin' to eat, maybe laugh
		a little, who knows... Would
		ya like, I dunno, go out
		together?

Adrian opens the door... She already has her winter coat on.
 

									42.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		We'll have a good time.

Paulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging
smile...

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's ya sister like to do?

				PAULIE
		Ice skate.

				ROCKY
		I didn't want no turkey anyway.

				ADRIAN
		It's Thanksgiving.

				ROCKY
		To you, to me it's Thursday.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink.

				ROCKY
		Looks quiet, y'know.

				ADRIAN
		I think it's closed.

				ROCKY
		I think mebbe we're early or
		somethin' --

From across the rink a CLEANING MAN yells at them.

				CLEANER
		Hey, whatta ya doin' here --
		we're closed... Yo, we're
		closed!

				ROCKY
			(yells back)
		Are ya closed to the General
		Public or to just everybody.
 

									43.


				CLEANER
			(starts to walk over)
		Hey, the rink is empty 'cause
		we're closed -- ya ain't
		allowed in here so do me a
		favor an' not stay here.

				ROCKY
		Wait here, gotta smooth this
		guy out.

				ADRIAN
			(softly)
		We could go somewhere else
		an' --

Rocky approaches the Cleaner.

				CLEANER
		Yo, pal, what's with you --
		The place ain't operatin'.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I gotta problem.  This
		girl ain't feelin' well,
		y'know -- The doctor says she
		should exercise, y'know once
		in awhile an' ice skatin' is
		the best thing --

				CLEANER
		This a con?

				ROCKY
		Look at her, ya can see she
		ain't feelin' good -- needs a
		few minutes exercise --

				CLEANER
		Few minutes?

				ROCKY
		... Ten minutes.

				CLEANER
		Ten minutes for ten dollars.

				ROCKY
		... Yeah, give 'er the Blades.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Adrian has on skates.  Rocky follows her onto the ice.  He
wears street shoes.
 

									44.


				ADRIAN
		... Aren't you skating?

				ROCKY
		Ain't skated since I was
		fifteen -- That's when I
		started fightin' -- gotta
		watch the ankles.  Yeah,
		fightin' use to be tops with
		me, but no more.  All I wanted
		to prove was I weren't no
		bum -- That I had the stuff to
		make a good pro.

				ADRIAN
		And you never got the chance?

The Cleaner yells from the sideline.

				CLEANER
		Nine minutes!

				ROCKY
		Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still
		fight.  Kinda do it like a
		hobby.  See I'm a natural
		southpaw an' most pugs won't
		fight a southpaw 'cause we
		mess up their timin' an' look
		awkward -- Southpaw means
		lefthanded... But I guess in
		the long run things probably
		worked out for the best, right?

				ADRIAN
		But you never had a chance to
		prove yourself.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CLEANER
		Eight minutes!

Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall.

				ROCKY
		I just dislocated my finger.

				ADRIAN
		Ohh!

				CLEANER
		Seven minutes!
 

									45.


				ROCKY
		It ain't your fault -- I
		originally done it in the Baby
		Crenshaw fight.
			(opens his wallet)
		That's me fightin' Big Baby
		Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the
		size of an airplane an' I
		broke my hands on his head --
		I lost, but it's a nice
		picture, don't ya think?

				CLEANER
		Six!

				ROCKY
		How 'bout some Cokes?

				CLEANER
		Cost ya a buck.

				ROCKY
		This guy is beautiful -- get
		the Cokes.

Adrian does a slight turn and Rocky has to speed up and
nearly falls.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		See, I ain't graceful,
		y'know -- I don't move good --
		Stink as a dancer too -- But I
		can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw
		an' nobody wants to fight a
		southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?

Adrian nods and is very nervous... The Cleaner moves
carefully across the ice.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Y'know how I got started in
		the fight racket?

				ADRIAN
		By accident?

				CLEANER
		Here -- Three minutes.
 

									46.


				ROCKY
		Yeah -- My ol' man who was
		never the sharpest told me --
		I weren't born with much brain
		so I better use my body.

For the first time, Adrian laughs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's funny?

				ADRIAN
		My mother told me just the
		opposite.  She said, 'You
		weren't born with much of a
		body so you'd better develop
		your brain.'

				CLEANER
		Time!

The Cleaner walks over as Rocky and Adrian get off the ice.

				CLEANER
			(continuing)
		That's ten bucks.

				ROCKY
		I must be goin' deaf 'cause I
		thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

Rocky hands him a dime.

				CLEANER
			(weakly)
		... How 'bout for the Cokes?

				ROCKY
		Charge it.

Rocky and Adrian start to leave.  Rocky pauses at the door
and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Had ya goin', didn't I, huh?

He grins and leaves.
 

									47.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

				ROCKY
		Some people are very shy by
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		I would say you're very shy bu
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		Some people think bein' shy is
		a disease, but it don't bother
		me.

				ADRIAN
		It doesn't bother me either.

				ROCKY
		Then why did I bother bringin'
		it up?  'Cause I'm dumb,
		that's why... Y'know, I think
		we make a real sharp coupla
		coconuts -- I'm dumb an'
		you're shy.

				ADRIAN
		... It is just hard for me to
		understand why anybody wants
		to be a fighter.

				ROCKY
		Ya gotta be a little soft to
		wanna be a pug... It's a
		racket where ya' almost
		guaranteed to end up a bum.

				ADRIAN
		I don't think you're a bum.

				ROCKY
		... I'm at least half a bum.
		Yeah, fightin' is a crazy
		racket.  The roughest part is
		the mornin' after.

				ADRIAN
		Morning after?
 

									48.


				ROCKY
		After a rough fight, ya'
		nothin' but a large wound.
		Sometimes I feel like callin'
		a taxi to drive me from my bed
		to the bathroom... Ya' eyes
		hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair
		even hurts... But the thing
		I'm proud of is I been in over
		sixty fights an' never had a
		busted nose -- Bent an'
		twisted an' bitten but never
		broke... That's rare.

				ADRIAN
		Why do you do it if it hurts
		so bad?

				ROCKY
		... Guess.

				ADRIAN
			(pause)
		'Cause you can't sing or dance?

Rocky smiles.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment... She is
nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room...
Rocky goes to the icebox.

				ROCKY
		Would ya like a glass of water?

				ADRIAN
		... No thanks.

Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees
a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and
smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is
reflected in the mirror.

He turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the
turtle bowl.

				ROCKY
		Here's the guys I was tellin'
		ya about -- This is Cuff an'
		Link.

				ADRIAN
		I sold them to you.
 

									49.


				ROCKY
			(very embarrassed)
		... Oh, yeah, I bought the
		whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me
		the turtles, the bowl, an' the
		mountain -- I had to get rid
		of the mountain 'cause they
		kept fallin' off.

				ADRIAN
		Do you have a phone?

				ROCKY
		I had it pulled.  People
		callin' all the time.  Who
		needs it -- Who'd you wanna
		call?

				ADRIAN
		I wanna let my brother know
		where I am.

				ROCKY
		D'you really wanna call?

				ADRIAN
		Yes, I do.

				ROCKY
		You sure?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		I think he might be worried.

				ROCKY
		I'll call your brother.

Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's
		with me!  I'll call ya later.

Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not
smiling.  She looks frightened.
 

									50.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's the matter?  Ya don't
		like the room?

				ADRIAN
		It's fine.

				ROCKY
		It's only temporary.

				ADRIAN
		It's not that --

				ROCKY
		What's the problem?  You don't
		like me -- Don't like the
		turtles -- What is it?

				ADRIAN
		I don't think I belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's okay.

				ADRIAN
		No, I don't belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's all right -- You're my
		guest.

				ADRIAN
		... I've never been in a man's
		apartment before.

				ROCKY
			(gesturing)
		They're all the same.

				ADRIAN
		I'm not sure I know you well
		enough -- I don't think I'm
		comfortable.

				ROCKY
		Yo, I'm not comfortable either.

				ADRIAN
			(standing)
		I should leave.
 

									51.


				ROCKY
		But I'm willin' to make the
		best of this uncomfortable
		situation.

Adrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; softly)
		Would ya take off your glasses?

				ADRIAN
			(dumbstruck)
		What?

				ROCKY
		The glasses... Please.

Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes.

				ADRIAN
			(timidly)
		... T-thank you.

				ROCKY
		Do me another favor?

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		Could ya take off that hat.

After a moment, Adrian removes the hat... She is becoming
rather pretty.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I always knew you was pretty.

				ADRIAN
		Don't tease me.

The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing...
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body.

				ROCKY
		I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
		have to kiss me back if ya
		don't feel like it.

Rocky softly kisses the woman... Her arms hang limp.  He
puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond.
Her hand glides like smoke up his back.
 

									52.


She embraces his neck.  The dam of passion erupts.  She
gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.

EXT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The following day, Rocky strolls down the street to
Goldmill's Gym... Out front a group of young blacks stop
talking and study Rocky as he passes.  Rocky's eyebrows knit
in confusion.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym...

... In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the
athletes stare in wonderment... The big black heavyweight
contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and
turns away.

Mike quietly approaches Rocky.

				MIKE
		Hey, Rock -- What happened?

				ROCKY
		'Bout what?

Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office...

				MICKEY
		Did ya get the message, kid?

				ROCKY
		Message -- What message?

Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket... He hands
it to Rocky.

				MICKEY
		A Rep from Miles Jergens'
		Promotions was lookin' for
		ya -- They need sparrin'
		partners for Creed.

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on?

				MICKEY
		Here's the card?

				ROCKY
		When was they here?
 

									53.


				MICKEY
		'Bout an hour ago.

				ROCKY
		Probably lookin' for sparrin'
		partners.

				MICKEY
		... I said that before.

Rocky turns from Mickey and jogs out of the gym.  Mickey
fumbles with his rosary beads.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		... Waste of life.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Rocky steps off a bus in mid-town Philadelphia.  He hurries
down Broad Street.  Every few steps he breaks into a trot...
He enters a skyscraper.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - HALL - DAY

Rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of Miles
Jergens' Productions.

INT. JERGENS' PRODUCTIONS - DAY

The SECRETARY is slightly startled by Rocky's excited
expression.

				SECRETARY
		May I help you?

Rocky hands her the business card.

				SECRETARY
			(continuing)
		Your name, please?

				ROCKY
		Balboa, Rocky Balboa.

The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes
the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls.

The Secretary returns.

				SECRETARY
		You may go in.

Rocky collects himself and enters...
 

									54.


INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Miles Jergens warmly greets him.

				JERGENS
		Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles
		Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

				ROCKY
		... Thanks.

				JERGENS
		Mr. Balboa --

				ROCKY
			(overriding)
		Rocky.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, do you have any
		representation?  A manager?

				ROCKY
		No -- Just me.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in --

				ROCKY
		Sparrin'?

				JERGENS
		Excuse me.

				ROCKY
		I know ya need sparrin'
		partners -- I'm very available.

				JERGENS
		I'm sure you are.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely -- Sparrin' with
		the Champ would be an honor --
		y'know what?

				JERGENS
		What?

				ROCKY
		I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
		I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
 

									55.


Jergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in fighting Apollo Creed for
		the Championship?

				ROCKY
		... Like I said, I'd make a
		boss sparrin' mate.

				JERGENS
		Did you hear what I said?

				ROCKY
		Sure, an' I'm smart enough to
		know that no sparrin' partner
		should take cheap shots at the
		Champ.  He's just there to
		help condition the man.

				JERGENS
		Not spar, I'm asking whether
		you would be interested in
		fighting Creed for the
		championship.

The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky.
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case
as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses.

				ROCKY
		... Ah... Absolutely.

The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and
white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to
Apollo being interviewed.

				REPORTER #1
		How'd you like the 'City of
		Brotherly Love?'

				APOLLO
		I like my Philadelphia Brothers.
		An' I'm patriotic!

Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting
microphone.
 

									56.


				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			mock seriousness)
		If yo' don't back up I'm gonna
		send yo' home with a microphone
		in yo' nose!

The Reporters laugh.

				REPORTER #2
		Why did you agree to fight a
		man who has virtually no
		chance of winning?

				APOLLO
		If history proves one thing,
		everybody gotta chance --
		Didn't yo' all ever hear of
		David an' Goliath? -- 'Course
		I woulda knocked out Goliath.

				REPORTER #3
		It is a coincidence that
		you're fighting a white man on
		the most celebrated day in the
		country's history?

				APOLLO
		The same coincidence that he's
		fightin' a black man.

				REPORTER #1
		What're your feelings about
		the challenger?

				APOLLO
		He's Italian.

				REPORTER #1
		What does that mean?

				APOLLO
		It means if he can't fight, I
		bet he can cook!

Rocky and Adrian laugh at the interview... Paulie, her
brother, takes offense.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- His lungs,
		punch 'em out.

				ADRIAN
		Paul.
 

									57.


Rocky's interview now fills the screen.  Rocky squints and
looks nervous under the hot lights.

				REPORTER #2
		This is your largest payday
		ever -- How do you feel about
		it?

				ROCKY
		Feel?  I dunno... Happy.

				REPORTER #2
		How will you fight Apollo Creed?

				ROCKY
			(mind elsewhere)
		Creed's great, ain't he...
		I'll do what I can.

				REPORTER #1
		Where did you get the name,
		'Italian Stallion?'

				ROCKY
		I thought of it 'bout eight
		years ago, when I was eatin'
		dinner.

				REPORTER #2
		Is it true the most you've
		ever made in a prizefight is
		five hundred dollars?

				ROCKY
		Four hundred -- But that was a
		long time ago.

				REPORTER #2
		And now your payday will be
		one hundred and fifty thousand
		dollars.  Any comment?

				ROCKY
		Listen, I wanna say hi to my
		girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!

Adrian blushes and laughs.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky!

				PAULIE
			(dry)
		Christ.
 

									58.


				ADRIAN
		You didn't!

				ROCKY
		Sure I did.  You heard.

They continue to watch the remainder of the interview... The
head COMMENTATOR is looking directly into the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		A Bicentennial Fight --
		January first.  It will be the
		first sporting event on our
		two hundredth birthday and is
		already being called by many
		the greatest farce in sports
		history.  If this man lasts
		more than a minute I would say
		he's on borrowed time.
			(sarcastically)
		It's matches like this with
		their exorbitant prices that
		give sports a bad name -- Not
		only is this match bad,
		people, it's sad!  Why a Rocky
		Balboa?  At the State Athletic
		Commission, Larry Duggan
		reporting.

				PAULIE
			(irate)
		The guy's a friggin' moron.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				PAULIE
		Don't it matter none he's
		makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd
		break his lips.

				ROCKY
		It don't matter.

				PAULIE
		He's takin' cheap shots.

				ROCKY
		It don't bother me none.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be
		lookin' for people to help,
		right?
 

									59.


				ROCKY
		Help what?

				PAULIE
		Y'know, to help keep ya livin'
		clean.

				ROCKY
		I'll do okay.

				PAULIE
		Ya gotta have a guy help ya
		exercise, mebbe somebody to be
		standin' by with a towel or
		run errands, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Hey, who cared about me
		yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I
		think I'm gonna train myself.

				PAULIE
		Without havin' good people
		around, ya won't have such a
		good chance.

Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude.
She faces him.

				ADRIAN
		Einstein flunked out of
		school... twice.

				PAULIE
		That so.

				ADRIAN
		Roosevelt finished last in his
		class -- Beethoven was deaf,
		an' Helen Keller was blind --
		I think Rocky has a good chance.

INT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her.

				ROCKY
		See ya tomorrow.

Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he
converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE
ECHOES up the stairwell.
 

									60.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How'd ya like hearin' ya name
		on TV?

				ADRIAN
		I don't know -- I was shocked.
		Why did you do that?

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on, right?

				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		Absolutely -- What time should
		I expect you?

				ROCKY
		'Bout seven.

				ADRIAN
		I'll be waiting.

Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the
top floor landing.

				ROCKY
		Y'know how I said that stuff
		on television didn't bother me?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		It did.

As Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and
slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front.
They are eating hot sandwiches.

				ROCKY
		Y'know I won't be able to work
		for ya no more.

				GAZZO
		Hey -- if a good man can make
		a better life, let him make it.

				ROCKY
		I feel bad about walkin'.
 

									61.


				GAZZO
		Take your shot, kid -- You got
		money for trainin' expenses?

				ROCKY
		A few bucks.

Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.

				GAZZO
		Here's five hundred -- Put it
		in your glove.

				ROCKY
		Do I have to pay juice?

Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"

Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at
the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Does Santa Claus charge juice?
		Merry Christmas -- Now, how's
		about my present, ya gonna win?

				ROCKY
		Gonna try.

				GAZZO
		Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya
		know, I'm with ya -- Italian,
		we're blood.  You kill this
		rug -- We Guinneas gotta show
		these Afro-Americans where
		it's at.  Give it your best
		shot cause I want ya to prove
		to these bums on the corner
		that my man can't be beat by
		this rug... Ya got any action
		on the side.

				ROCKY
		No action.

				GAZZO
		Ya gettin 150 grand killer.
		Ya got any plans for it?
		Whatta ya think?
				(MORE)
 

									62.


				GAZZO (CONT'D)
		Ya like to put it on the
		street, make it work for ya?

				ROCKY
		I'm gonna do somethin with it.

				GAZZO
		Sure, you do what ya want.
		Stay away from the stock market.

				ROCKY
		Black market?

				GAZZO
		Same thing.  Ya know, Rock,
		remember when we was kids, we
		fought together.  An' I wasn't
		well an' ya had to beat up
		that Irish kid -- what's his
		name? -- Gallager -- I bought
		a suit and became a businessman.
		You put on gloves.  An' I
		remember Mama almost cried,
		may she rest in peace -- an'
		our ol' man who said ya had no
		brains -- I'd like to lay
		hands on that bastard.  You
		ain't never had any luck.
		Even when I owned you in '66
		you never had luck.  But now I
		think you might be gettin'
		some luck kid.  Whatta you
		think?

Rocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car.  Rocky follows him
across the street.

				ROCKY
		Yo, you gonna show, Tony?

				GAZZO
		Where else am I gonna go.
			(to Bodyguard)
		Bet three grand on Rocky.

				BODYGUARD
		He's a bum -- are you kiddin?

				GAZZO
			(slaps Bodyguard)
		No!  I'm not kiddin!

Rocky walks away.
 

									63.


INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning
on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds
the turtles.

				ROCKY
		Look who's home!

Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He
approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one.
Settling on the bed, he reads the other.

A KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill,
the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.

				MICKEY
			(stiffly)
		I seen the light.  I figure
		somebody was home.

				ROCKY
		Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
		here?  Here, sit down.

Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Best seat in the house -- Hey,
		Mick, this is too much.

				MICKEY
		How do you mean?

				ROCKY
		I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
		but seein' ya here, in my
		house, it's kinda outta joint.

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
something important is preying on his mind.

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
having outsiders see how he lives.

				MICKEY
		Listen, Rock, you're a very
		lucky guy.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.
 

									64.


				MICKEY
		What's happened is freak luck.

				ROCKY
		Freak luck for sure.

				MICKEY
		Look at all them other fighters.
		Real good boys.  Good records.
		Colorful.  Fight their hearts
		out for peanuts -- But who
		cared?  Nobody.  They got it
		shoved in their back door.
		Nobody ever give them a shot
		at the title...

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		Freak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles.

				MICKEY
		Whatta' those?

				ROCKY
		Turtles -- domestic turtles.

				MICKEY
			(businesslike)
		I'm here tellin' ya to be very
		smart with this shot.  Like
		the Bible sez, ya don't get no
		second chance.

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya need a manager.  An advisor.
		I been in the racket fifty
		years.  I done it all, there
		ain't nothin' about the world
		of pugilism that ain't livin'
		up here.

He lights a half-smoked cigar.

				ROCKY
			(at a loss)
		Fifty years, huh.
 

									65.


				MICKEY
			(stronger)
		Fifty years.  The rep is known
		around Philly, an' a good rep
		can't be bought, but I don't
		have to tell you that.

				ROCKY
		How 'bout a glass of water?

				MICKEY
		Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		... What?

				MICKEY
			(driving each
			word hard)
		I done it all.  I've done an'
		seen everything'.  Believe
		what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya
		shoulda seen the night in
		Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'
		Russo outta the ring, September
		14, 1923 -- same night Firpo
		knocked Dempsey outta the ring.
		But who got the Press?  He did.
		He had a manager -- September
		14, 1923.

				ROCKY
			(softly)
		Ya got a good mind for dates.

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.

				MICKEY
		Look at this face -- twenty-
		one stitches over the left
		eye, thirty-four over the
		right -- my nose was busted
		seventeen times, the last
		being the Sailor Mike fight
		New Year's Eve, 1940, in
		Camden, New Jersey -- What a
		professional pastin' I give
		him.  Here, read about it.

									66.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
			(shows a tiny
			press clipping;
			points to
			cauliflower ear)
		An' he give me the vegetable
		on the ear.  I got pain an'
		experience... an' you got
		heart -- kinda remind me of
		Marciano, ya do.

Rocky points to his most prized possession.

				ROCKY
		Nobody ever said that --
		There's his picture.

				MICKEY
		Yeah, ya kinda remind me of
		the Rock.  Ya move like 'im.

Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more
than being compared to his idol.

				ROCKY
		Really think so?

				MICKEY
		Ya got heart.

				ROCKY
		Heart, but I ain't got no
		Tocker.

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
crouch.

				MICKEY
		Christ, I know this business.
		Rocky, when I was fightin' it
		was the dirtiest racket goin',
		see.  Pugs like me was treated
		like fightin' dogs -- throw ya
		in the pit an' for ten bucks
		ya try to kill each other.  We
		had no management...
				(MORE)
 

									67.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		fought in boxcars, in
		whorehouse basements, any
		joint with a floor -- October
		1931 I fought a bum who put a
		tack in the thumb of his glove
		an' punched so many holes in
		my face I had spit shootin'
		outta my cheeks -- I never had
		no manager watchin' out for
		me -- See that picture outside
		the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'
		that's me in my prime.  I had
		all the tools.  I coulda
		starched any lightweight husky
		on the East Coast -- But I had
		no management.  Nobody ever
		got to know how slick I was,
		but I had a head for business
		an' stashed a few bucks an'
		opened the gym -- It's a dirt
		hole, I know it, but that an'
		a lotta scars is what I got to
		show for fifty years in the
		business, kid -- now you come
		along with this shot an' I
		feel like it's me gettin' the
		shot I never got... Yeah, we
		was treated like dogs -- like
		them Dago's, no offense, in
		the Colosseum in Rome there --
		An' now I got all this
		knowledge, I wanna give it to
		ya so I can protect ya an'
		make sure ya get the best deal
		ya can!

Rocky rises and opens a window.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Respect, I always dished ya
		respect.

				ROCKY
		... Ya gave Dipper my locker.

				MICKEY
			(almost begging)
		I'm sorry, I -- I made a
		mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man
		to man.  I wanna be ya manager.
 

									68.


				ROCKY
		The fight's set -- I don't
		need a manager.

				MICKEY
		Look, you can't buy what I
		know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it
		all!  I got pain an' I got
		experience.

				ROCKY
		I got pain an' experience too.

				MICKEY
		Please, kid.

				ROCKY
			(tightly)
		Whatever I got, I always got
		on the slide.  This shot's no
		different.  I didn't earn
		nothin' -- I got it on the
		slide... I needed ya help
		about ten years ago when I was
		startin', but ya never helped
		me none.

Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He
remains on one knee.

				MICKEY
		If ya was wantin' my help, why
		didn't ya ask?  Just ask.

				ROCKY
		I asked, but ya never helped
		nothin'! -- Like the Bible
		sez, ya don't get no second
		chance.

				MICKEY
			(yells)
		Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
		old.  Maybe you can be the
		winner I never was -- your
		shot is my last shot!

Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
door.

Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.

Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
 

									69.


EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his
shoulder.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with
great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter.

At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills
the basin and submerges his face in cold water.

Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He
cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
swill... his body quivers.

EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

Rocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and
his steaming breath attests to the cold.

He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
street lamps.

Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN

Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
of stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
into the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
legs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the
stairs.

EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN

Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,
heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several
lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
aching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe
with amusement.

Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
 

									70.


EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN

Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
elevated train station.  The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
blend perfectly with his muscular running style.

EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

The sky is beginning to lighten.  The fighter now runs along
the piers and past anchored freighters.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
belonging to Eastern Packing Company.  Alongside the loading
platform come several boxcars.

Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door.  It soon
opens and Paulie guides him inside.  Paulie is drunk.

INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY

				PAULIE
		How ya feelin'?

				ROCKY
			(panting)
		... Tight.

				PAULIE
		I got whiskey here.

				ROCKY
		... No.

Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.

				PAULIE
		This is the guy who's fightin'
		Apollo Creed.

				JOSE
			(heavy accent)
		Good luck -- Kill him, man.

				PAULIE
			(as though
			rehearsed badly)
		Hip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --
		Hip -- Hip --
 

									71.


				JOSE
			(walks away)
		Hooray, man.

				PAULIE
		Rock'll be comin' by every
		mornin' to pick up some
		Prime -- can't train on that
		store crap.

Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.

INT. FREEZER - DAY

They enter.  The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
darkness to the far end of the refrigerator.  The blower
overhead causes the men to speak loudly.

				PAULIE
			(teasing)
		If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
		up hangin' on the hook, right?

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's a good man.

				PAULIE
		How 'bout you talk to 'em
		about me?
			(tightly)
		Please do me that favor.

				ROCKY
		Keep this job, ya eat better.

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat.  He
swills whiskey from a pint bottle.

				PAULIE
		Y'know, d'ya think you an' my
		sister -- Ah, doin' good
		together?

				ROCKY
		Whatta you think?

				PAULIE
		Ain't sure, what's the story?

				ROCKY
		What?
 

									72.


				PAULIE
		The story -- what's happenin'?

Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
quite a while.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Ya really like her?

				ROCKY
		Sure I like her.

				PAULIE
			(nervous laughter)
		What's the attraction?  I
		don't see it?

				ROCKY
		I dunno -- she fills gaps.

				PAULIE
		What gaps?

				ROCKY
			(shrugs and
			takes meat)
		She got gaps.  I got gaps --
		together we fill the gaps.

				PAULIE
			(sharply)
		You ballin' her?

				ROCKY
			(turns around)
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

				PAULIE
			(tersely)
		C'mon, ya screwin' her?

From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.

				ROCKY
		That's why I can't put ya
		together with Gazzo, cause ya
		talk too much -- big mouth.

Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a
hanging beef.
 

									73.


The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
responds.

Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.

The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.

Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
though he were locked in total battle.

				PAULIE
		Hit the rump.  The rump!
		Ya'll break the ribs!

Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark
recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his
POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.

Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef
swings and appears surrealistically alive.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		We do that to Creed an'
		they'll take us to jail for
		murder.

Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to
the elbows with beef blood.

Paulie hands him a package of beef.

				ROCKY
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes
reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING.
Rocky pounds a heavy bag.

Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
pocket.
 

									74.


				MICKEY
			(passionate)
		Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
		It's clumsy.  You're off
		balance.

He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the
string.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
		two feet slack.

				ROCKY
		I never had good footwork.

Mike completes the task.

				MICKEY
		Forget the footwork -- You're
		off balance.  The legs are
		sticking everywhere.  Marciano
		had the same problem, an' the
		string cured it.  When you can
		hit and move without breakin'
		the string you'll have balance.

				MIKE
		You'll be a very dangerous
		person.

Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.

				BOY
		Rocky, could we have your
		autograph?

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				MICKEY
			(irate)
		Don't you boys ever interrupt
		when I'm conductin' business,
		or I'll kill you both -- Go
		away.

The boys depart.
 

									75.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Autographs!  Ya wanna be a
		writer or a fighter?  Let's
		work.

Mike looks off across the gym.

				MIKE
		... we got visitors.

Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of REPORTERS and NEWS
CAMERAMEN entering his gym.

				MICKEY
			(approaching)
		Can I help you guys?

				REPORTER
			(to Cameraman)
		Set the camera up over there.
			(to Mickey)
		We're from Channel Seven --
		Covering the pre-fight training.

				MICKEY
		I own the place.

The Reporter has a hundred things on his mind... he turns
from Mickey and nods to his crew... the other television
crews rush to set up.

				CAMERAMAN
		Rolling here.

				SOUND MAN
		Speed here.

				REPORTER
			(to the camera)
		We're here at Goldmill's
		Gym -- A Philadelphia landmark
		of sorts since 1929 -- The
		stench of toil permeates every
		corner.  The sweat a trademark
		of a unique profession... Yet,
		the most unique fixture is an
		unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog
		heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa.

The camera turns to Rocky.
 

									76.


				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Should I do this?

Mickey nods and Rocky faces the glaring lights.

				REPORTER
		So much has happened lately --
		Has it changed your life style
		much?

				ROCKY
		... People talk to me more.

				REPORTER
		How're you preparing for this
		Bicentennial bout?

A young punchy fighter yells out:

				FIGHTER
		Readin' fuckin' history books,
		man!

The gym explodes with laughter.

				REPORTER
			(flushed)
		We can cut that out later.
		Apollo Creed says he'll let
		you stay three rounds before
		he puts you away.

				ROCKY
			(honestly)
		Apollo's a great fighter.

				REPORTER
		Do you feel you have a chance?

				ROCKY
		Maybe --

He faces Mickey.  Mickey whispers in his ear.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I'll tear his head off.

				REPORTER
		Do you have anything derogatory
		to say about the Champion?
 

									77.


				ROCKY
		Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great.

Apollo Creed and his entourage enter the gym.

				APOLLO
			(bellowing)
		I am the Champion of the whole
		world!!!

The gym freezes... everyone turns and stares in wonderment...
Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.  He now
realizes it is a publicity stunt.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
			(approaching Rocky)
		Italian Stallion, I come over
		to tell you to be very smart
		an' after this fight donate
		what's gonna be left of your
		body to science, cause after
		this fight what's left won't
		fill a tuna fish can!... So
		beware, Mon Cher!!!

Apollo turns to the cameras... Rocky is speechless.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		This classic fight -- Tha's
		right, this bicentennial
		fight's goin' down in the
		history books 'cause January
		first I'm gonna be the first
		man to bounce another man offa
		the planet Pluto!

Dipper stands in the far ring... the attention Rocky is
receiving makes him a killer.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now I gots a special
		announcement, y'hear.  For the
		first time in alotta years
		this championship fight is
		gonna be on your home T.V.!
		Free -- 'Course that's just
		for Philly -- My present to
		the city...
				(MORE)
 

									78.


				APOLLO (CONT'D)
		Now some ya'll ain't much on
		likin' me, but ya gotta admit
		Apollo Creed is one DAMN
		generous, 100% pure, government
		inspected, Afro-American Folk
		Hero!!!

Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large
snake.  He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky.  He
nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.

Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.

				DIPPER
			(loud)
		Ya nothin', Boy!

Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence... The
television crew faces Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing)
		I say ya nothin'!

				MICKEY
		What's happenin' here?

				DIPPER
		I'm happenin'!  This pig is
		takin' my shot -- I iz a
		contender.  He's nothin'.

				ROCKY
			(dumbstruck)
		Yo', Dipper, why're ya --

				DIPPER
			(shaking his fist)
		Spar me in front of these here
		TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to
		Jersey!

Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper
slaps them soul style.

				MICKEY
			(to Dipper)
		You can forget about sparring,
		kid.

				DIPPER
		Yo' know I iz the best man
		here!  Yo' said so yoself!
 

									79.


				MICKEY
			(almost
			apologetically
			to the crew)
		Why let Rocky here take a
		chance on cuttin' or breakin'
		a hand? -- Take a shower,
		Dipper.

				DIPPER
		Don't mouth me, old man, I'll
		knock yo' out too.  C'mon,
		wop, spar me, let everybody
		see who's got the heat around
		here.

Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The
scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew
slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.

				DIPPER
			(continuing; insanely)
		Man, yo' best keep them
		cameras out!  Fight me, boy!
		Let Creed here see the kind of
		punk he's fightin'!

Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky.

				MIKE
		Don't chance it, man -- He's
		sick.

				MICKEY
		This is gettin' outta hand --
		Rocky will fight in the ring
		January first, not here!

				DIPPER
		Yo' yellow, old man.

				MICKEY
		Not yellow, cautious.
			(to the crew)
		See, it's very easy for a
		fighter to accidentally hurt --

Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard
across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold.
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.
 

									80.


				DIPPER
		If yo're afraid to fight me,
		then get down an' kiss my
		feet, boy.

Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds
before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.

				MICKEY
			(softly)
		Let's take a walk, Rock.
		Please, don't take a chance.
		He wants to hurt you so you
		can't fight.

Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around
his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper
steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.

Mike jumps forward.

				MIKE
		Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
		Back off, scumbag, or I'll
		bite your face!

Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The
room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth
between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and
they begin to ease away.

				DIPPER
		... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles
forward and stands before Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing;
			almost in a whisper)
		... Kiss 'em.

Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's
feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the
shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of
combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD
and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very
gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of
apprehension... He leaves.
 

									81.


Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes
his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.

				MICKEY
		The kid's got cannons -- Print
		that.

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken
figure lying on a dirty gym floor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
				ADRIAN
		Don't you open them anymore?

				ROCKY
		They either say, 'Kill the
		nigger' or 'Hope you die,
		Honky.' -- What ya got in the
		bag?

Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but
lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.

				ADRIAN
		Like?

				ROCKY
		Sharp -- Real nice.

				ADRIAN
		Really -- You don't think
		they're overly feminine?

				ROCKY
		No... Sharp -- You look great.

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath...
Rocky smiles.  His eyes show what he feels for this woman.

				ROCKY
		Adrian, you really look great,
		y'know -- But I can't fool
		around durin' trainin' --
		makes the legs weak.

				ADRIAN
		Don't want weak legs.
 

									82.


				ROCKY
		Can't fool around -- You look
		very great.

				ADRIAN
		-- The legs.

				ROCKY
		Yeah... But I think weak legs
		ain't bad sometimes, y'know.

Rocky approaches in a seductive manner.  Adrian
uncharacteristically removes her sweater.  Underneath is a
T-shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win."

				ADRIAN
		I thought it might be cute.

				ROCKY
		Ya right --
			(laughs)
		Mebbe we best just hold
		hands -- the shirt made me
		feel guilty, y'know.

SCENE FADES.

EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

Rocky is running... for extra weight he carries his huge
dog, Butkus.  After a half a block he sags under the weight,
and laughing, begins to wrestle with the dog on the
pavement... Rocky tries to sneak away from the dog, but
after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the
street.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is early morning and as usual Rocky jogs to the meathouse.
He is followed by his new dog, Butkus.  He is stopped short
when he notices several television news vans parked out front.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

He and the dog enter the freezer area and see several
reporters and men with mini-cameras milling around... Paulie
is waiting for him -- Rocky is upset and goes outside.
Paulie follows.
 

									83.


EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock.  I made a few phone
		calls an' thanks to me ya
		goin' to be a big man --
		Thatta dog?

				ROCKY
		Whatta these guys want?

				PAULIE
		To see ya train.

				ROCKY
		Yo, what's with you? -- It was
		suppose to be private.

				PAULIE
		I thought I was doin' ya a
		favor -- C'mon inside --
		Y'know, my sister really likes
		ya.

Rocky follows Paulie inside.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAY

A REPORTER points in Rocky's direction and suddenly he is
surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned
beside a slab of hanging beef.  The camera lights go on.

				COMMENTATOR
		Just relax, Mr. Balboa --
			(to the camera)
		Today we're here with
		heavyweight challenger, Rocky
		Balboa.  The reason we are
		standing in a refrigerated box
		is that Mr. Balboa has an
		unusual method of training and
		in a moment he is going to
		demonstrate it for our viewing
		audience -- But first, Rocky,
		how did you ever come to train
		in an icebox?

				ROCKY
		Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me
		in one day an' I hit the beef
		here an' liked it -- An' since
		I become a challenger, the
		owner don't mind neither.
 

									84.


				COMMENTATOR
		Is this a common training
		method -- I mean do other
		fighters pound raw meat?

				ROCKY
		I think me and Paulie invented
		it.

				COMMENTATOR
		Would you give us a
		demonstration?

Rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with
incredible intensity... Everyone present is taken aback.
Rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his
hands dripping beef blood.

The Commentator is unnerved and Rocky looks straight into
the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists.

				COMMENTATOR
		... Diane Lewis in the
		meathouse with the Southpaw,
		Rocky Balboa.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Apollo sits behind Jergens' desk.  Jergens is not present.
Four middle-aged and younger types and Creed's lawyer sit
around the desk.  The desk is flowing with forms and charts.

				APOLLO
		How much is being channeled
		into West Coast closed-circuit
		advertising?

				LAWYER
		Three hundred thousand.

				APOLLO
		Make it four hundred an' fifty.
			(to younger man)
		Send two hundred roses to the
		mayor's wife from me, get a
		picture an' make sure it gets
		all the papers.

				BUSINESSMAN #3
		Do ya want to run the fifteen
		radio spots in the mid-west?
		I think you could spend the
		money better in Canadian
		publicity.
 

									85.


				APOLLO
		Yeah, I'd like to get Canada --
		see, if we can get a tax
		break -- Gimme the figures on
		the Program Concession.

Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened
corner looking at a small television.  He is watching
Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news...

He waves at Apollo.

				TRAINER
			(worried)
		Apollo, you oughta come see
		this boy you're gonna fight on
		TV -- looks like he means
		business.

Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork.

				APOLLO
		I mean business, too --
			(to men)
		The gross rental of the arena
		is gonna include the four
		hundred ushers, right? --
		Gimme some coffee.

EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT

It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street
and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a
chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen.

He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills
the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES
traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens
and he staggers towards the bedroom.

He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a
crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the
otherwise darkened room.

				ADRIAN
		... And he called the
		reporters --

				ROCKY
		Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
 

									86.


				ADRIAN
		Don't be mad at him -- He just
		wants to help.

				ROCKY
		Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just
		outta joint when reporters are
		around -- They take cheap
		shots an' Paulie knows it.

				ADRIAN
		... Are you going to say
		anything to him?

				ROCKY
		... What's to say?  I dunno
		what he wants from me --

Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the
room.

				PAULIE
		Nothin'!  I want nothin' from
		you!!!

				ADRIAN
		Paulie!

				PAULIE
		Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I
		ain't no charity case!  Get
		outta my house!

				ADRIAN
		It's not your house --

				PAULIE
		You ain't no friend no more --
		Go home!  Outta my house I
		want ya!

				ADRIAN
		Don't talk like that to him!

				PAULIE
		Get outta my life both of ya's.

Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be
bordering on a nervous breakdown.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Outta my house I want ya!!
 

									87.


				ROCKY
		... It's cold outside, Paulie.

Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball
bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow.

				PAULIE
		I don't want ya messin' up my
		sister no more -- He's scum
		from the corner, I don't raise
		ya to hang with no bum!

Adrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(continuing;
			raising the bat)
		... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon --
		C'mon, I'll break both ya arms
		so's they never work...

Rocky freezes...

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie.  Stop now!

				PAULIE
		I want 'im outta here --
			(to Rocky)
		Don't think I'm good enough to
		work for Gazzo?
			(spits)
		That's what I think of bums
		like you an' Gazzo!
			(spits again)
		You're goin' up an' don't care
		enough to throw Paulie some
		crumbs!
			(spits)
		I give ya meat, an' I give ya
		my sister, too!

				ADRIAN
		Only a pig would say that!

Paulie smashes a small table with the bat.

				PAULIE
			(to Adrian)
		You forget what I went through
		to give ya the best.
 

									88.


				ADRIAN
		You gave me what?!  Knots!
		You gave me knots in here
		every day -- you made me
		scared of everything!

				PAULIE
		I always seen ya had the best,
		but did ya ever think of
		puttin' in a good word for me
		with this scumbag!

Paulie smashes a large lamp with the bat.

				ADRIAN
		Don't do that again!

				PAULIE
		Get away from me -- I could
		never even get married 'cause
		you couldn't live by yaself --
		ya'd die by yaself!  So
		instead I put you two
		together -- Did ya think of
		puttin' in a good word for
		me? -- You owe me!

				ADRIAN
		Owe you what?

				PAULIE
		You owe me an' are supposed to
		treat me good!

				ADRIAN
		Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've
		been treatin' you like a baby.
		Since I can't remember it's so
		long -- I'm the only one who
		feeds you an' puts you in bed
		when ya can't stand up -- and
		it's you that made me feel
		like a loser -- That's what ya
		use to call me 'Loser' -- What
		kind of name is that?  So can
		ya blame me for not remembering
		to talk about you when I'm
		with Rocky -- I don't owe you,
		Paulie, you owe me.

The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat.

				PAULIE
		You busted?!
 

									89.


				ADRIAN
		What?!

				PAULIE
		You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in
		ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya
		pulled down ya pants an' let
		him have it, didn't ya!!

Mortified, Adrian runs to her room... Rocky steps to Paulie.

				ROCKY
			(fuming)
		Hey --

Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses... Rocky remains still.

				PAULIE
			(softly)
		... I can't haul meat no more.

				ROCKY
		What can I do about it?

				PAULIE
		Christ, I been beggin' ya for
		a break until I'm sick inside.

				ROCKY
		What break?  Huh?  What break!
		Who am I to give breaks!  I'm
		a fighter, you haul meat.  You
		do what you do an' I do what I
		do best -- that's it -- that's
		life, man!

Paulie looks ashamed... Rocky walks, then returns.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... An' what ya said to my
		girlfriend ain't right -- Do
		it again, I'll kill ya.

Rocky goes into the bedroom... Adrian has buried her face in
a pillow... She is rocking slightly.  Rocky cradles her and
kisses her cheek.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Wanna hear a dirty joke?
 

									90.


				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		... Yes --

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room
is dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is
watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky
watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like
a huge dancer around the ring.

				MICKEY
		His defense is great, can't
		lie 'bout that -- You have a
		rollin' style.  Can't retreat
		as fast -- But your style
		ain't retreatin'.

They both watch the flickering images.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		See how he plays sometimes --
		Drives his cornermen nuts.
		Nobody knows his next move --
		Him included.

They watch more action... Creed has a fighter helpless
against the ropes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Killer instinct -- Ya both got
		the killer touch.  Interestin'.
		See that! -- Right-cross
		combination.  Beautiful.  But
		you got the power to rip the
		body.

They watch more action.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Rocky, when ya climb into the
		square, an' know ya' meetin'
		the best fighter in the world,
		ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna
		be ready 'cause I been waitin'
		for fifty years -- Fifty years.
		When I'm done with you, you'll
		gonna be able to spit nails.
				(MORE)
 

									91.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		You'll gonna be able to eat
		lightin' and crap thunder --
		You'll be a very, very
		dangerous person...

The SCENE FADES on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring
transfixed at the images projecting on the wall...

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration.
As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - LATER

Rocky now works on the incline situp board... While doing
situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell.
The pain is evident on his face.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders...
Mickey coaching drives him on.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around
the ring swinging at them.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression
is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats
Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball...
Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky
heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and
Mickey nods.

				MICKEY
		What cha say, Benny -- Meet
		'The Rock.' This is our
		cutman, Benny Stein.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Benny.

				MICKEY
		Check the eyes, Ben.
 

									92.


Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes.

				BENNY
		Ain't bad.  Seen worse --
		Cover up an' things should be
		okay.

				MICKEY
		Take a shower.

Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie
who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room
entrance.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock, I think I found an
		angle to make some bread usin'
		ya name, ya mind?

Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods
'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie
strides off.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Running... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled.
Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY

It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a
huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens...
Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending
stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing
the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at
the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells
with pride... He is ready.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky
is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated
behind his wide desk.

				MAYOR
		Sit down, Rocky.

Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him.
 

									93.


				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I've been going over your
		record -- You've been the busy
		type --
			(reading)
		Nineteen arrests -- probation
		three times -- expelled from
		seven public schools in 1964
		and '65.

Rocky tries to sink into the chair.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I'm a very busy man, but I
		just wanted to remind you that
		you'll be setting an example
		for thousands of guys like
		yourself and maybe start them
		off in a new direction and
		give our police force a
		break -- I also hope you try
		your very best and bring pride
		to Philadelphia.

				ROCKY
		... I'll try.

The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters.

				MAYOR
		Would you stand up, please.

Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture
is taken three times... The photographer exits.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		Thank you for coming by,
		Rocky -- good luck.

				ROCKY
			(turns)
		Any time.

				MAYOR
			(sitting)
		Wait... After the fight you'll
		have nearly a hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars -- What
		do you plan to do with it?
 

									94.


				ROCKY
			(smiles)
		... Run for mayor.

The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big,
friendly laugh, and Rocky exits.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at
new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian
Stallion or Donkey?" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky
stands with the mayor.

				ADRIAN
		Rocky, do you realize everybody
		in this country knows your
		face, and after the fight
		everybody in the world is
		going to.

				ROCKY
		Yeah...

She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman,
Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other
clippings.

The TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new
white object hanging on the wall.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		My first call... Hello?  Yeah,
		speakin' -- Who is this?
		Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo,
		Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't
		seen ya for nine or eight
		years -- Yeah, things is
		great, how's things with you
		upstate -- Ya sellin' real
		estate, hey, that's a good
		job... Yeah, I gotta advance,
		but I bought ringside seats
		for the guys at the gym.  I
		get the hundred an' fifty
		grand after the fight...

Adrian overhears the statement.
 

									95.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Yeah, I know it's a lotta
		money -- Condominiums?  Nobody
		uses them anybody.  Listen, I
		think a pet shop is a good
		investment, y'know -- I don't
		care 'bout long hours --
		there's no depreciation --
		that don't matter none to
		me -- Yeah, I like animals.
		Why don't ya give me ya number
		an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme
		getta pencil --

Rocky makes no motion to get a pencil.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Okay, what is it -- four-
		twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah,
		thanks for callin' -- Sure
		I'll get back to ya, Bruce --
		see ya.

Rocky hangs up.

				ADRIAN
		What was that you said about a
		pet shop?

				ROCKY
			(distant)
		... What?

				ADRIAN
		What did you say about a pet
		shop?

				ROCKY
		I don't want ya cleanin'
		nobody else's cages no more.

				ADRIAN
		Is everything all right?

				ROCKY
		I gotta go out for a while.

Rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; to dog)
		... Come.
 

									96.


INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - NIGHT

Rocky arrives at Goldmill's Gym... He unlocks the gym's door.
Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym.

Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the
steps to Mickey's office... At the top of the stairs he
looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters
the office.

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered
desk and sets up the projector... He goes to the cabinet and
removes a stack of 16 mm films.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

The office clock indicates it is several hours later.  Rocky
is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film.  He sits
motionless.

Rocky sits upright.  Something catches his eyes... He
springs at the projector.  He reruns the scene several times.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

Several hours later Rocky is engrossed in watching another
Apollo Creed film... He sits motionless.  Something catches
his eye.  Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering
a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent.

Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it
was a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing
on a note pad.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN

The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy
windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
has lost interest in watching the movies.

The film has completed its run through the projector and
lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
his reddened eyes.
 

									97.


The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
stare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies
Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
fighter's mind.

				MICKEY
		... I know what you're
		thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
		gotta shot -- All ya can do is
		try ya' best.

Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits
the room.  Mickey walks over and turns off the projector.
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it
slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.

EXT. STREET - DAWN

After leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly
move down the street and head for home.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Rocky arrives at his apartment... Adrian is asleep on the
couch.  He lowers himself beside her.  Her eyes open.

				ROCKY
		... Can't do it.

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		... I can't beat him.

				ADRIAN
		Apollo?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, I can't beat him.

Adrian touches his face.

				ROCKY
		I been watchin' the movies --
		studyin' -- He ain't weak
		nowhere.

				ADRIAN
		What're we going to do?

				ROCKY
		... I dunno.
 

									98.


				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.

				ROCKY
		It ain't so bad, 'cause I was
		a nothin' before --

				ADRIAN
		Don't say that.

				ROCKY
		C'mon, it's true -- But that
		don't bother me -- I just
		wanna prove somethin' -- I
		ain't no bum... It don't
		matter if I lose... Don't
		matter if he opens my head...
		The only thing I wanna do is
		go the distance -- That's all.
		Nobody's ever gone fifteen
		rounds with Creed.  If I go
		them fifteen rounds, an' that
		bell rings an' I'm still
		standin', I'm gonna know then
		I weren't just another bum
		from the neighborhood...

Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers
himself beside his woman.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... No foolin' around.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is
the Philadelphia Spectrum.

The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed
celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into
their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red,
white, and blue sweater...

The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and
blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE
WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN
FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent
except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the
arena.
 

									99.


It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING
SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room.
Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.

Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the
adhesive tape.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except
for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only
SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase
his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of
APOLLO TAKING IN AIR.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

A heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's
eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with
the grease.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Grease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME
CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into
the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and
lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from
the screen.
 

									100.


INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's trainer slips a mouthpiece into Apollo's mouth.
Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places
another one in the champ's mouth... Creed nods yes.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom.
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.  Completing his silent
prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
of his life.

Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
in and nods that it is time.  He leaves... Rocky steps out.

				MICKEY
		... It's time, kid.

Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.

				ADRIAN
		... I'll wait for you here.

Rocky nods and she kisses him.  The fighter leaves with his
trainers... Adrian is on the verge of tears.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rocky, Mickey and Mike start down the long hallway... Up
ahead are three security guards... Rocky rubs his bare
shoulders.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mick, can I have my rob?

Rocky puts on the robe... Embroidered across the back in
flaming letters is:

		"THE ITALIAN STALLION"

				*Pennzoil*

Mike helps him into the robe... Mickey is not amused.

				MICKEY
		Don't you care what the people
		will say?

				ROCKY
		... I'm doin' it for a friend.
 

									101.


				MICKEY
		Whatta you get outta this?

				ROCKY
		I get the robe an' Paulie gets
		three grand.

				MICKEY
		... Shrewd.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

TWO RINGSIDE COMMENTATORS sit in front of a panel of closed
circuit televisions.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		We would like to welcome our
		viewing audience to the Grand
		World Championship Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Fight -- the first
		major event of the Bicentennial
		Year... A point of interest is
		that the fight is being beamed
		to more than seven hundred and
		fifty million fans in theatres
		in nearly every corner of the
		world.  I would like to
		welcome an old friend, and co-
		commentator for this evening's
		event -- Jimmy Michaels.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Thank you, Bob.  The
		electricity is everywhere
		tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
		fifty-to-one underdog, is
		living a Cinderella story
		which has captured peoples'
		imaginations all over the
		world -- to quote a popular
		sports magazine, 'The fighting
		style should be 'The Caveman
		Against the Cavalier.' From
		the increase in sound it
		appears the challenger is now
		approaching the ring... His
		record is forty-four wins,
		twenty losses and thirty-eight
		knockouts.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I only wonder if this man has
		the skill to go past three
		rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
 

									102.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
insults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
the greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar
faces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
Washington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to
DEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and
Creed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington
outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
white and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,
white and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
silk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes
match the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
beard.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You could go deaf with the
		noise -- it undoubtedly means
		Champion Apollo Creed is
		heading towards the ring --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Am I seeing right?  Creed is
		approaching the ring in a boat.
		Is he supposed to be George
		Washington?  Obviously so.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		It's been confirmed that it is
		definitely an impersonation of
		George Washington -- a great
		way to start 1976 off.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I agree.

Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.

				APOLLO
		I want you!  I want you!

The crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to
his corner.

				MICKEY
		Don't let 'im get you tight.
 

									103.


				ROCKY
		Whatta ya think that outfit
		cost?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men
in suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely
and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky
waves at him.  Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at
his date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.

				ANNOUNCER
		Ladies and gentlemen --
		Welcome to the Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Championship
		Fight... We are very proud to
		have with us four former Great
		Champions... Ladies an' gents,
		'The one and only 'Manassa
		Mauler' -- Jack Dempsey!'

The CROWD ROARS and JACK DEMPSEY waves and goes to Creed's
corner, then Rocky's.

				DEMPSEY
		Good luck, kid.

He moves off.

				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Christ, Jack Dempsey.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer points and the timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

				ANNOUNCER
		Former Middleweight Champion --
		'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake
		LaMotta!

JAKE LA MOTTA raises his fist and gives best wishes to both
contenders... Timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		The man with the big punch --
		Everybody's favorite, 'The
		Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis!
 

									104.


JOE LOUIS bows and steps to Creed's corner.  Creed strikes a
boxing pose and Louis tosses a playful punch.
				ROCKY
		They must be friends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Now, last but certainly not
		least -- the former Heavyweight
		Champion, a son of Philly,
		Smoking Joe Frazier!

FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS.
Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's
going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They
laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner.

				FRAZIER
		Save some of him for me.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The former champ looks great --
		Can we get Joe over here --
		here he comes.

Joe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(continuing)
		Joe, what are your feelings
		about tonight's fight?

				FRAZIER
		Well, I think any man who
		works an' trains hard always
		gotta chance.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You look in great shape, Joe.

				FRAZIER
		I'm always in shape.

Joe laughs and exits.  The timekeeper RINGS the BELL.
 

									105.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		... Now for the evening's main
		event -- In the corner to my
		right, The Challenger, wearing
		white trunks -- At one hundred
		an' ninety-one pounds, one of
		Philly's own sons -- 'The
		Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa!

A good CROWD RESPONSE.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		In the far corner, wearing
		red, white an' blue -- Weighing
		in at two hundred and ten
		pounds -- Undefeated in forty-
		six fights -- the Heavyweight
		Champion of the World -- 'The
		Master of Disaster' -- Apollo
		Creed!

The arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the
center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules
Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The
Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the
screen... Something soulful and frightening is being
communicated.

				REFEREE
		... Now come out fighting.

The fighters return to their corners.

				MICKEY
		God bless ya, Rock.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as
though he considers the man an amateur.
 

									106.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The Champ stings the slower
		challenger with jabs at
		will -- Balboa blocks eighty
		percent of the blows with his
		face -- Creed doesn't look the
		best he's ever been but is
		moving smoothly -- Creed snaps
		out a triple combination that
		backs Balboa into a corner --
		oh, a solid hook by Creed, a
		master of fist-men.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		The Champion is smiling and
		toying with the man -- trying
		to give the fans their money's
		worth and make a show of it
		with the badly out-classes
		challenger -- Another left to
		right combination.  I feel
		sorry for --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Creed is down!!!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw.
Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show
disbelief.  So do Rocky's.

Rocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him.

				MICKEY
		You can do it!  Goddamnit, you
		got the power!  The body, get
		the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!

				REFEREE
		Six!... Seven!... Eight!...

Creed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all
business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly.

				APOLLO
		... Come at me, sucker!

Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's
chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed
to cringe...
 

									107.


Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations
to the body.

The BELL RINGS.

ROCKY'S CORNER

				ROCKY
		How am I doin'?

				MICKEY
		Real good.

				ROCKY
		See how fast he is -- damn!

				MICKEY
		Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin
		down!!  Use the legs and drive
		through 'im.  Attack --
		Attack -- Attack!

APOLLO'S CORNER

Apollo does not sit.  He stands and clowns with the
spectators to prove he is not hurt.

				APOLLO
			(to Trainer)
		... That boy damn near broke
		my arm.

				TRAINER
		Sure -- He can hit -- Don't
		play no more -- Stick an'
		move, hear?

				APOLLO
		I'll carry him 'till the third.

				TRAINER
		Don't play with this man, he's
		fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel
		some real heat!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast
and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that
dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs
his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.
 

									108.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding
combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that
flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The
round ends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he
is beginning to show the strain from the body punches.

				APOLLO
		Man, I rearranged his face
		with that right -- The people
		love what's happenin' tonight.

				TRAINER
		People nothin', you in a
		fight, my man, -- ya best
		believe what you hear... Knock
		that boy out soon an' let's go
		home.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling
around his eyes... The nose is shattered.

				MICKEY
		Ya nose is broke.

				ROCKY
		Damn!  How's it look?

				MICKEY
		Can't hardly tell.  Don't
		swallow the blood -- Go for
		his ribs.  Don't let 'im
		breathe.

				ROCKY
		... The guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Why don't ya tell 'im you're a
		fan!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators are caught up in the action.  They speak
rapidly into their microphones.
 

									109.


				COMMENTATOR #2
		If you had asked anyone who
		knows boxing, they never
		would've predicted a first
		round knockdown and the second
		round punishment to the body
		of the Champion... Most
		fighters will tell you,
		receiving a good body punch is
		the next worst thing to dying.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Round three ready to start and
		should be interesting to see
		if Creed can put the challenger
		away -- there goes the bell.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Round three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side-
steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general,
Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and
Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling...
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to
the heart.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Apollo almost sprints out of
		his corner -- feints and
		throws a pair of left-right
		combinations.  Balboa drops
		beneath a left upper cut and
		lands a very solid shot on
		Creed's temple -- not much
		movement from Balboa, duck a
		left, a right, another left
		and explodes with a right hook
		to the temple -- I mean
		explodes.  The Champ backs off.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		There's no way Apollo expected
		this kind of hitting power.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		No way -- but the brilliant
		ability of the Champion to
		master situations like this is
		one of his most outstanding
		traits -- Creed tosses a
		perfect right hand that rocks
		Rocky.
				(MORE)
 

									110.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		Creed on the offensive --
		Balboa takes the punishment
		and counters with a left flush
		over the heart... that hurt.

The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A
STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a
terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.
Creed's face contorts with excruciation.

				TRAINER
			(yelling)
		Cover your face!  Cover up!
			(to Assistant)
		My man's cut, my man's
		bleedin' -- Get ready!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close
the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut.

				TRAINER
		Bad?  Talk to me, man!

				DOCTOR
		Deep, but passable.

				APOLLO
			(staring at Rocky)
		... That man's takin' his job
		too serious.

				TRAINER
		He's movin' to your left --
		don't let him no more -- dance
		and stick, hear?  Don't
		play -- I know what ya feelin',
		but don't play.

				APOLLO
		He got lucky.

				TRAINER
		Luck!  You fightin' a crazy
		man -- but you got him hurt
		bad.
			(to Assistant)
		More ice, now!
 

									111.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly
swollen around the eyes.

				MICKEY
		How you holdin' up, kid?

				ROCKY
		Fine... That guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Gimme the water!  Ya getttin'
		tagged with his right.  I
		think you should feint left
		and high hook 'im -- Benny,
		check the eyes!  Can ya see?

				ROCKY
			(standing)
		See what?

				MIKE
		Ya sappin' his strength --
		He's losin' steam.

				ROCKY
		He ain't losin' nothin'.

				MICKEY
		Keep on him -- You're doin'
		great.

SERIES OF SHOTS

In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to
ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut.
Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Adrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the
GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.

INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT

Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door
at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE
OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back
to watching the fight.
 

									112.


INT. ARENA - NIGHT

Adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the
battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.

Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a
thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...
Rocky is game but losing.

At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
his seat.

Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.
Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the
bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and
cheer loudly.

				ANDY
		... The Rock's got real stones.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

The men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips
and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
outclassed.

				APOLLO
		C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He
sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound
and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But
Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators shift in their seats.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Without a doubt this is the
		most punishing brawl I have
		ever seen -- The ringside
		audience is spotted with blood.
				(MORE)
 

									113.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		This fight should have been
		stopped rounds ago but Rocky
		Balboa refuses to fall --

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Not only has he refused to
		fall, but he has beaten the
		Champion's body without mercy
		and the bout has become a
		vicious slugfest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely
hurt.

				APOLLO
		My side.

				TRAINER
			(to Assistant)
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		No doctor!

				TRAINER
		You're hurtin', man!

				APOLLO
		No doctor!... I'm feelin'
		good, bro!

ANOTHER ANGLE

In Rocky's corner, things are frantic.  His eyes are swollen
shut.

				MICKEY
		Wanna keep goin'?

				ROCKY
		Would you keep goin'?

				MICKEY
		... Yeah.

				MIKE
		No more, ya wanna lose an eye?
		No more.
 

									114.


				ROCKY
		Open my eyes -- Please, open
		my eyes!

Mickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife
between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement
he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
one is ever aware of the operation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
She is caught up in the heat of the battle.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,
but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined
to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and
receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to
ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
to stay down.

				REFEREE
		Six -- Seven -- Eight --

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He
is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into
Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like
a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he
leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
judges and continues to fight.
 

									115.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
corner.

				APOLLO
		... Ribs broke --

Blood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.  The
Trainer feels the ribs.

				TRAINER
		Yo' bleedin' inside, man --
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		One more round.

				TRAINER
		Don't kill yourself, man --
		Let the doctor stop the fight.

				APOLLO
		... Stop jivin'!

				TRAINER
		Cover the ribs -- Look here,
		elbow down, tight -- Tight --
		stand straight -- you're the
		best, you're the best!

				APOLLO
		... Thanks.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely
been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant.

				ROCKY
		How I look out there, Mick?

				MICKEY
			(truly worried)
		Great, kid, great.

The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.

				DOCTOR
		One more round -- How do you
		feel?

Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He
cannot be bothered with pain or doctors.
 

									116.


				ROCKY
		Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna
		make it -- I'm gonna make it!

Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition.

				MICKEY
		We gotta stop it, kid.

				MIKE
		Ya gave it ya best shot!

				MICKEY
		Nobody's gonna say ya didn't
		give ya all.  I can't let ya
		go out.

Rocky stands and eyes them all.

				ROCKY
			(impassioned
			and quietly)
		I'll kill ya all... Don't stop
		nothin' --

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner
and circles to Rocky's right.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The fight has slowed down to a
		near stand-still -- Creed
		circles to Rocky's right...
		The spectrum is nearly
		silent -- Neither fighter has
		made a motion to throw... I've
		never seen anything like it in
		the last round of a
		championship fight... Apollo
		spits blood on the canvas.  It
		appears he is protecting his
		right side.  His ribs were
		probably injured at the end of
		round fourteen.
				(MORE)
 

									117.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		It's confirmed, unofficially,
		Creed's ribs may be broken --
		Apollo fakes a left and throws
		a big tired right -- Balboa's
		mouthpiece is out!  Creed
		attacks with one hand!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes
a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
their feet.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.
written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for
blow.

				ROCKY
		Gimme ya best!!!!

Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Gimme ya best!!!

Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.

The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit
of strength from their souls and beat each other without
mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension
far beyond blood and pain.

				SIX
				FIVE
				FOUR
				THREE
				TWO
				ONE!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval.
 

									118.


Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the
midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.

As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
ear.

				APOLLO
		... Ain't gonna be no rematch.

				ROCKY
		... Don't want one.

Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to
his corner... Mickey embraces him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer enters the ring with a microphone.

				ANNOUNCER
		Attention, please!!  Attention!!
		Ladies and gentlemen, tonight
		we have had the rare privilege
		to have witnessed the greatest
		exhibitions of stamina and
		guts ever in the history of
		sports.

The CROWD ROARS.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		Ladies and gentlemen -- We
		have a split decision!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo did not expect this and tenses.  His corner nervously
tries to reassure him.  It does no good.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at
Mickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Walker scores it eight-
		seven Creed... Judge Roseman
		scores it eight-seven Balboa.
 

									119.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo is rigid.  Fear radiates from his eyes.  To lose the
crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill
him... A silence has blanketed the arena.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Conners scores it nine-
		six Creed... Winner and still
		Heavyweight Champion of the
		World, Apollo Creed!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of CHEERING fans
that circle the ring and reach out towards him... Mickey
grabs Rocky's hand and raises it.  The CROWD ROARS.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what they say,
		you're a winner.

				ROCKY
		Yo, can I have my locker back?

Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs
Rocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky
turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
shoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the
ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
reflect admiration.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-
wishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting
apprehension as the fans become abnormally active.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.
Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but
they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
along by a legion of fans.
 

									120.


ANOTHER ANGLE

On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
frightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to
control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
clamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
their shoulders.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against
each other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'

Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'

ANOTHER ANGLE

Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he
starts swinging.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the
crowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless
as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...
The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
forward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
through the mass to get to Rocky.

ANOTHER ANGLE

She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
but she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,
Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
and waits for the procession to pass.

The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be
king of the world.

The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on
her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams
Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
the racket and reaches Rocky.

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is
carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the
crowd won't permit it.
 

									121.


Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a
down escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky
manages to crawl across them to Adrian.

Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up
and they lock in an embrace.

				ADRIAN
		I love you -- I love you -- I
		love you...

The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can
remember...

				THE END
"ROCKY"

RING PRODUCTIONS, INC.

MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED:
 




INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"

... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
fighting.

In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a
plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.

The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is
hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.

The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
across the ring at Rocky.

				BLACK FIGHTER
			(to cornerman)
		... I'm gonna bust his head
		wide open!

In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.

				CORNERMAN
			(lackluster)
		... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
		suckers some action.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				CORNERMAN
			(overriding)
		Ya movin' like a bum -- Want
		some advice --

				ROCKY
		... Just gimme the water.
 

										2.


A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.

				FAN
		Should I bet the fight don't
		go the distance -- Ya feel
		strong?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CORNERMAN
		... Ya want some good advice?

				ROCKY
		... I just want the mouthpiece.

The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The
fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in
a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.

Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into
the ring.  Rocky ignores it.

The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does
not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new
fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."

				ANNOUNCER
		Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
		six rounder between local
		lightweights.

Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up
the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.

THE TITLE CREDITS END:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
 

										3.


				FIGHTER #1
		... Tomorrow me an' my woman
		are gonna tip on down to
		Atlantic City, man.

				FIGHTER #2
		... It's cold, Bro'.

				FIGHTER #1
		... That's right, I got the
		city to myself...

Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
spit nervously on the floor.

A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
that is BLASTING MUSIC.

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
are smoking.  The room is cloudy.

A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater
buttoned over a t-shirt.

				PROMOTER
		...Balboa!?

Rocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.

				PROMOTER
			(continuing)
		... Twenty bucks for the
		locker an' cornerman -- Two
		bucks for the towel an'
		shower, seven for tax -- The
		house owes ya, sixty-one
		dollars.

The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.

INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT

Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
self-conscious.

				ROCKY
			(almost apologetic)
		I'm a fighter.
 

										4.


				WOMAN
			(tired)
		... Yo' iz an accident.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.

Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
bookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.

Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to
the dog and continues to the corner.

EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
in the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away
the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
enters.

INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

The narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light
bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a
curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is
used as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.

Rocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of
glasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
creatures.

				ROCKY
		...Look who's home.

Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The
record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."

... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.

The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
 

										5.


EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN

We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
sits majestically above City Hall...

EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING

Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
over one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.

Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
car.  These men look like blood drinkers.

				MAFIA #1
		Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss?

				ROCKY
		Real good.

				MAFIA #2
		Fightin' again?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, here an' there.

				MAFIA #1
		Mebbe we make sum money
		togather soon... Give ya boss
		my best.

Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
the crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
crane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the
gangplank.

INT. SHIP - DAY

The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
crates and coffee beans.

Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.

				FATS
			(terror-filled)
		Don't hit the face!  Not the
		face!!

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo wants the two
		hundred now!
 

										6.


				FATS
		Honest to God I'm broke --
		Gimme a break.

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo says I should get
		two hundred or break the thumb.

				FATS
		Please, I need my hands to
		work -- Christ, don't bust my
		thumbs.

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
stevedores.  Rocky remains cool.

				ROCKY
		Goin' fishin'?

The man drops the hook.

				ROCKY
		What's ya name again?

				FATS
		Bob.

				ROCKY
		Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
		ya gotta pay the band -- If ya
		borrow, ya gotta pay the man...
		Me, I ain't emotionally
		involved.

Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man
quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
wad of bills.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; counting)
		A hundred an' thirty.

				FATS
		That's it, I'm broke.

				ROCKY
		That's it? -- Completely?

				FATS
		That's it.

				ROCKY
		What about for food an' stuff?
 

										7.


				FATS
		You have my food in ya hand.

Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
flushed expression.

				ROCKY
		... The juice is climbin'
		every week.

				FATS
		I know the juice is climbin' --
		I been workin' six months just
		to pay the damn interest.

				ROCKY
		Ya still light seventy.

				FATS
		Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't
		have to break nothin' -- Here,
		take my coat, it's worth
		fifty-sixty dollars.  It's
		yours.

The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...

				FATS
			(continuing)
		See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
		don't have to know nuthin'.
		I'll go tape up the hand like
		ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo
		won't be wise to nothin' -- Be
		a smart guy, keep the coat,
		we'll fake like ya broke the
		hand.

The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
man's thumb and bends him to his knees.

				FATS
			(almost a whisper)
		No - no - no - Please -
		Please - Please don't...

Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The
thumb is fine.

				ROCKY
		...That's what coulda happened.
			(walks off.)
 

										8.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In
the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the
window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and
presses his face against the window and does his impression
of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks
away.

The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not
very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.
Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.

INT. PET SHOP - DAY

				ADRIAN
		... Could you take the puppy
		out --

				CUSTOMER
		It can breathe.

				ADRIAN
		Please -

				CUSTOMER
		Please, nothin' - I paid for
		this dog and can do whatever I
		want with it - I can throw it
		through the window if I want -
		Now give me my two dollars
		back before I do throw it
		through the window.

Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it
to Adrian.

				CUSTOMER
		Get away from me - Give me that!

Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
to the lady... She nervously exits.

				ROCKY
		... How's the turtle food this
		week?
 

										9.


				ADRIAN
		... Fine.

				ROCKY
		Me, I'm kinda aggravated.

				ADRIAN
		... I'm sorry.

				ROCKY
		Ain't your fault - Here's the
		problem.

Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.

				ROCKY
		The last food I got here had
		more moths than flies -- An'
		the moths get caught in my
		turtle's throat -- That makes
		them cough --

The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
waves at Rocky.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
		about the turtle food -- Like
		I was sayin', the moths get
		caught in the turtle's throat
		an' makes 'em cough...
			(coughs)
		A little cough an' I gotta
		smack 'em on the shell -- An'
		whatta think they get?

Adrian shrugs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I smack 'em hard on the shell
		an' they get... What?

				ADRIAN
		... I don't know.

				ROCKY
		Shell-shocked!

Both the Owner and Adrian smile.
 

									10.


				OWNER
		Startin' with the bad jokes
		early today, huh.

				ROCKY
		Inventin' jokes ain't easy.

Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
Inside is a huge dog.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How's Butkus this mornin'?

				OWNER
		Ain't had time to check 'em.

Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
very happy.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

The dog plays dead.

				ROCKY
		...What kinda dog is this again?

				OWNER
		Bullmastiff.

				ROCKY
		The owner was suppose to pick
		him up three weeks ago.

				OWNER
		We're not responsible for
		animals left over thirty
		days - We board it ain't a
		animal shelter, Y'know.
		...Adrian, I want you to clean
		all those cat cages downstairs,
		they're a mess.
			(Adrian nods.)


Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.

EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY

Gazzo picks up Rocky.
 

									11.


INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
Rocky is in the back seat.

				ROCKY
		He only had a hundred an'
		thirty. -- I think he's good
		for the rest next week, Mr.
		Gazzo.

				GAZZO
			(patiently)
		Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for
		it...

Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty.

				GAZZO
		Tomorrow collect from Del
		Rio -- He's late three weeks.
		How'd you do last night?

				ROCKY
		... Fine.

Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
mirror and smiles.

				BODYGUARD
		Did ya get the license number?

				ROCKY
		Of wa?

				BODYGUARD
		... Of the truck that run over
		your face.

Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.

				GAZZO
		Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job
		this mornin?  How come ya
		didn't break this guy's thumb
		like I asked ya?  When ya
		don't do what ya are told, it
		makes me look bad, kid.

				ROCKY
		I figure if I break the thumb
		this guy gets thrown outta his
		job and can't pay nothin no
		more.
 

									12.


				GAZZO
		It don't matter.  It's my
		reputation.  These guys think
		they can get off light.  It's
		bad for my reputation -- It's
		bad for business.  See ya
		killer.

Gazzo gets into his car.

				GAZZO
			(to Bodyguard)
		... The Rock's a good kid.

				BODYGUARD
			(emotionless)
		... A meatbag.

They pull away.

EXT. GYM - DAY

Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar
people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is
apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
and mentally defective.

				RUDY
		...See the fight last night?

				RUDY
		Nah, I was fightin' myself.

				RUDY
		Apollo Creed beat the bum to
		pieces.

EXT./INT. GYM - DAY

Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.

Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The
MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
 

									13.


The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
wave and yell greetings.

				FIGHTER #1
		Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
		Rice out in the sixth?

				ROCKY
		The third -- Shoulda seen it.

Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.

				FIGHTER #2
			(removes glove)
		Hey, Rock, touch my hand.

				ROCKY
		How come?

				FIGHTER #2
		C'mon, it's important.

Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.

				FIGHTER #2
			(continuing)
		Can ya tell I just whacked-off?

Rocky smiles and moves away.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden
benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that
reads, "NO KISSING."

Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no
luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
situation.

After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is
taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.

				ROCKY
			(mumbling)
		... These ain't my clothes.
 

									14.


He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
of the door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... These ain't my pictures.

A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks
like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is
MIKE.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'
		here?

				MIKE
		It ain't your locker no more.

				ROCKY
		Whatta ya talkin' about it
		ain't my locker no more?

				MIKE
		Listen, I'm with you -- But ya
		gotta talk to Mickey -- I put
		ya stuff in the bag over there.

Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up.

				FIGHTER
		...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
		soap, Man.

				MIKE
			(irate)
		Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
		Nobody -- You don't call me
		Peanut.

				FIGHTER
		Peanut, gimme some soap.

The fighters laugh.  Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter.  It
hits just above the man's head.  The fighters are shocked
into silence.

Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
loudly in Spanish.
 

									15.


INT. GYM - DAY

Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
training routines.

				ROCKY
		You were ready to bite that
		guy's face.

				MIKE
		Yeah -- See the fight last
		night?  Apollo Creed beat that
		English guy bad.

				ROCKY
		Creed's great.

Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
another chore...

INT. GYM - DAY

The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He
wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.

Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what nobody says,
		this bum Creed woulda never
		made it in the Thirties --

				ROCKY
		Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

				MICKEY
			(monotoned)
		... What?

				ROCKY
		I said, how ya feelin'?

				MICKEY
			(dryly)
		Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?

				ROCKY
			(low)
		Yeah.
 

									16.


				MICKEY
			(spitting)
		Then stand there an' wait till
		I'm done -- Creed's good,
		yeah, he's real fine but I
		gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
		who's got the stuff it takes
		to be a champ -- He's mean,
		quick, an' big -- What more
		d'ya need?  Okay, go to work...
			(to Rocky)
		Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

				ROCKY
		I was talkin' with ya man,
		Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
		put outta my locker?

				MICKEY
		Dipper needed it.

Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Dipper's a climber -- You're a
		tomato.

				ROCKY
		... Tomato?

				MICKEY
		Facts is facts.  I run a
		business here -- I'm cleanin'
		house --

Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		How old are ya?

				ROCKY
		...What?

				MICKEY
		How old?

				ROCKY
		Come July, twenty-five.
 

									17.


				MICKEY
		More like thirty.

				ROCKY
		Twenty-five, thirty -- What's
		the difference? -- It took me
		two months to learn the
		combination of that locker.

				MICKEY
		The legs must be goin'.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, they're goin', -- that's
		nature... That was my locker
		for six years.

				MICKEY
		... Did ya fight last night?

				ROCKY
		Yeah --

				MICKEY
		Did ya win?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, Kayo.

				MICKEY
		... Who'd ya fight?

				ROCKY
		Spider Rice.

				MICKEY
		Rice is a bum.

				ROCKY
		You think everybody I fight is
		a bum.

				MICKEY
		Ain't they?

Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.
 

									18.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya want the truth -- Ya got
		heart, but ya fight like an
		ape -- The only thing special
		about you is ya never got ya
		nose broke -- keep ya nose
		pretty -- what's left of ya
		brain an' retire.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Did good last night --
		Shoulda seen it.

				MICKEY
		Hey, ever think about retirin'?

				ROCKY
		...No.

				MICKEY
		Think about it.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, sure.

Shrugging, Rocky moves away.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		...I think I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Shoulda seen me
		fight -- Did good, y'know.

Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.

				MICKEY
			(gesturing
			towards Rocky)
		Known him since he was
		fifteen -- A waste of life.

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big
Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of
water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.

				DIPPER
			(to Rocky)
		... I dig yo' locker, Man.

				TRAINER
		Time, Dipper.
 

									19.


Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on
Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off.

EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK

At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet
shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a
bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone.

INT. PET SHOP - DUSK

Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She
hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters.

				ROCKY
		... Wow -- cold!  Good night
		to catch pneumonia.

Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky
fumbles idly among the pet toys.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Ah -- I came in here for
		somethin'... Oh, yeah, would
		ya like somebody to walk ya
		home?

The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority
complex will not permit it... Rocky understands.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Hey, how's my buddy doin'?
			(looks into
			Butkus' cage)
		-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
		ya later.

				ADRIAN
		... Goodnight, Rocky.

Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed
emotions.

EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws
the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter
can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George
Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption
reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!"
 

									20.


INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

Rocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth...
Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer
in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone.

				ROCKY
		Catch pneumonia out there --
		Seen Paulie?

Andy casually nods towards the men's room.

Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on
the bar.

INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT

Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square
shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic
misanthrope.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(very drunk)
		Yo, Rocky -- Look at this
		mirror.  I'd like to kill the
		friggin' moron who broke this
		mirror.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Your sister's givin' me the
		shoulder.

				PAULIE
		Forget her.  You could do
		better than my sister.

				ROCKY
		Every mornin', every night I
		pass by -- I smile.
				(MORE)
 

									21.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She
		looks at me.

				PAULIE
			(annoyed)
		Looks, huh?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, like I was a plate of
		leftovers -- Somethin' wrong
		with my face -- Whatta I need,
		a Caddy to connect with ya
		sister?

				PAULIE
		My sister's a friggin' loser.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				PAULIE
		Sometimes she gets me so
		crazy, I'd like to split her
		head with a razor.

				ROCKY
		Don't get mental, man.

				PAULIE
		Ya caught me in a bad mood.

				ROCKY
		Ya always in a bad mood --

				PAULIE
		... Adrian ain't sharp.

The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
with the neckline of his t-shirt.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		She's a loser -- She don't
		enjoy life -- She reads --
		Brainy -- Pushin' thirty
		friggin' years old!  She's
		gonna die alone if she don't
		wise up.

				ROCKY
		I'm thirty myself.
 

									22.


				PAULIE
		An' you're dyin' alone, too.

				ROCKY
		I don't see no crowd around
		you, neither.

				PAULIE
			(pointing at
			the wall)
		I wanna kill the friggin'
		moron who broke the mirror.

				ROCKY
		Let's get outta this stink.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

The restroom door opens.  Rocky guides Paulie out.  Though
stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks.

				PAULIE
		The girl's dryin' up!  She's
		gotta live a little before her
		body dries up!!  You're a pal,
		Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
		her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
		tomorrow.

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				PAULIE
		Tomorrow you come for some
		bird, right?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely...

Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
to the bar.  Andy leans over to him.

				ANDY
		That was alotta crap to go
		through for a dinner invite.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
CREED.  Creed is twenty-eight years old.  He is a tall,
smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
colored face...
 

									23.


He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and
cornermen.  Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers
disembark a private jet.

				COMMENTATOR
		How was the flight, Champ?

				APOLLO
		Very high an' very fast.

Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he
says.

				COMMENTATOR
		Apollo, how would you rate
		this last British challenger,
		Henry Wilcoxson?

				APOLLO
		He was big, an' very nasty so
		I destroyed him in a hurry --
		Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac
		Lee Green next month.

				COMMENTATOR
		You're referring to the much
		publicized bicentennial fight?

				APOLLO
		That's right -- It's gonna be
		the greatest sportin' event in
		this country's history -- A
		gala occurrence!

				COMMENTATOR
		Still to be held in
		Philadelphia?

				APOLLO
		The Bicentennial Heavyweight
		Championship of the World is
		gonna be held in the only
		place it can be held --
		Philadelphia! -- the nation's
		cradle -- January First -- the
		first major event of our two
		hundredth year.

				COMMENTATOR
		Where're you off to now?

Apollo draws his wife close.
 

									24.


				APOLLO
		Me an' my wife are goin' home
		'cause we miss our children
		an' can't go no more time
		without seein' them.

				COMMENTATOR
		Any quick advice for young
		boxing hopefuls?

				APOLLO
			(looks straight
			into the camera)
		... Stay in school an' use
		your brains, dig -- Be a
		lawyer, be a doctor, carry a
		leather briefcase an' forget
		about sports!!  Sports can
		only make ya grunt an' smell --
		Be a thinker not a stinker!!

Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator
faces the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		Jerry Simpson at Kennedy
		Airport with the Champion,
		Apollo Creed.

The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at
the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking
the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.

				ANDY
		Nobody cares what's happenin'
		in the world of sports
		nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,
		downhill -- Basketball,
		downhill.  Football's goin',
		too.  Bank on it.  Baseball
		use to be America's best
		sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like
		squattin' through a great
		double header, but now
		baseball's all business.

The news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks.

				ANDY
			(continuing)
		Where are the real fighters?
		The pros.  Today we jig clowns.
 

									25.


				ROCKY
		Clown.

				ANDY
		Yeah.

				ROCKY
		He took his best shot an'
		became champ -- What shot did
		you ever take?

				ANDY
		Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with
		yourself?  Fine.  But me, I
		gotta business here -- I don't
		need to take no shot.

Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie
slumped unconscious in the booth.

Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers.

				ANDY
			(continuing; boldly)
		Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,
		I'll take a shot!

Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window
hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be
out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to
Rocky.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(aggressively)
		Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

				ROCKY
		... No wine -- Bad for ya'
		brain.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		C'mon, man, it's cold, man.

				ROCKY
		No wine.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
 

									26.


				ROCKY
		Why?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(sarcastically)
		'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
		a dollar.

				ROCKY
		No dollar.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Hey, give Rocky a dime.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		... How come?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		So he can call all his friends.

				ROCKY
			(mildly embarrassed)
		... That's an old one.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.

				ROCKY
		Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya
		brother know you're hangin'
		out so late?

The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
to impress her friends.

				MARIE
		... Screw you.

				ROCKY
			(awed)
		What'd you say?

				MARIE
		... Screw you, yoyo.

The gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.

				ROCKY
		Did these guys teach you to
		talk dirty?  Huh?
 

									27.


				MARIE
		Hey --

				ROCKY
		What?

				MARIE
		Stuff it, man!

				ROCKY
			(shakes her)
		Don't you never say that --
			(to the gang)
		-- You guys talk like that in
		front of a little girl -- You
		guys are scum.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		This is our place, dig!

The gang reluctantly backs up a step.

				ROCKY
		Don't ya never come round this
		girl -- Go home.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		This is our corner, man!  You
		go, chump!

Rocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(backpedaling)
		We'll kill you, man -- We
		gotta gun.

				ROCKY
		Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
		ya face!

Rocky leads the girl away.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently
cutting through a dark public school yard.  They pass
through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights
located at the top of the school building.  The atmosphere
is somewhat eerie.
 

									28.


				ROCKY
		How come ya wanna hang out
		with those guys?  They teach
		ya bad things.

				MARIE
		I like 'em.  If you don't you
		can f--

				ROCKY
		Hey!  When I was your age,
		there was only one girl who
		talked like that in the whole
		neighborhood.

				MARIE
			(bored)
		... Yeah.

She attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly
tosses it to the ground.

				ROCKY
		Make your teeth yella --

				MARIE
		I like yella teeth.

				ROCKY
		Makes your breath like garbage.

				MARIE
		Maybe I like garbage.

Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.

				ROCKY
		Nobody likes garbage --
		Anyway, this girl with the
		dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
		but the guys wouldn't take her
		out for any serious datin'.

				MARIE
		Why?

				ROCKY
		'Cause that's the way guys
		are -- They laugh when ya talk
		dirty.  They think ya cute for
		a while, but then ya getta
		reputation an' watch out.
				(MORE)
 

									29.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		Nobody's ever gonna take ya
		serious.  Ya get no respect...
		I gotta use a bad word --
		Whore.  You'll end up maybe
		becomin' a whore.

				MARIE
		C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve.

				ROCKY
		That doesn't matter -- You
		don't really have to be a
		whore, just act like one an'
		that's it.

				MARIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
		years from now people will say
		'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
		who was she?' 'She was that
		little whore who hung out at
		the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
		now I remember!'... See, they
		don't remember you, they
		remember the rep.

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light
from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.

The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
away.

Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.

				ROCKY
			(points down
			the block)
		... That's your house, ain't it?

Marie nods.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Listen, I hope ya don't --
 

									30.


				MARIE
		I won't.

				ROCKY
		What was I gonna say?

				MARIE
		Ya hope I don't keep acting
		like a whore or I'll turn into
		one, right?

				ROCKY
		Ya, somethin' like that.

They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made
an impact on her life.

				MARIE
		Goodnight, Rocky.

				ROCKY
		'Night, Marie.

She takes a few more steps and pauses again.

				MARIE
		... Fuck you, Creepo!!!

The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay.

				ROCKY
			(walks off)
		... Yeah, who're you to give
		advice, Creepo.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

APOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the
offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter
looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo
Creed.

				LAWYER
		Are the doctor's reports
		confirmed?

				JERGENS
		Definitely --
			(reading)
		-- It says here, Mac Lee Green
		has suffered a seriously
		cracked third metacarpal in
		his left hand.
 

									31.


				APOLLO
		Damn.

				JERGENS
		I suppose we could cancel the
		fight indefinitely if you are
		set on fighting Green.

				TRAINER
		It ain't just Green, what
		about the time Apollo's
		invested --

				JERGENS
		I believe we can find a
		solution.

				APOLLO
		Solution, nothin' -- What
		about the Bicentennial fight.

				LAWYER
		Jergens, don't play games with
		my client!  Apollo has already
		done nearly a million dollars
		worth of publicity --

				TRAINER
		Ten million's worth!

				LAWYER
		-- And has made contractual
		obligations with over twenty
		different organizations -- He
		doesn't want to be embarrassed.

				APOLLO
		You best find me another
		ranked contender an' I mean in
		a flash, man!

				JERGENS
			(holding up
			some notes)
		I contacted Ernie Roman's
		manager, he's fighting in
		France the same week.

				APOLLO
		Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's
		ranked fifth.
 

									32.


				JERGENS
		Shaw's fighting in South
		America -- Why not postpone
		the bout until July Fourth?

				LAWYER
		Hell with Fourth of July, man!
		Ten thousand things'll be
		goin' down on the Fourth of
		July! -- Apollo wants to be
		first!

				JERGENS
		That may not be possible, Jimmy.

				TRAINER
		This man here is the Star,
		dig -- Don't cause him to
		breathe heavy -- Now what
		'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes?

				JERGENS
		Went to California and gained
		fifty pounds -- and I called
		every worthwhile contender,
		but they say five weeks isn't
		enough time to get in shape.

Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it.

				APOLLO
		Shape, nothin' -- They're
		afraid.  They know everybody
		in the world's gonna see this
		fight an' none of them gotta
		prayer of beating me so
		they're makin' excuses so they
		don't have to be the chump
		that's gonna be whipped in
		front of the whole civilized
		world!!

				JERGENS
		Apollo, I'm sure there's a way
		to salvage this.

				TRAINER
		Nobody wants to be dissected
		on the country's birthday.
 

									33.


				JERGENS
		All I can counter with is that
		I'm a goddamn good promoter --
		I've promoted in every country
		in the world -- and I've tried
		to the best of my abilities.
		Perhaps you're right, and no
		one wants to be beat on the
		country's birthday... I don't
		know what else to say --

				APOLLO
		I do -- Maybe what this fight
		needs is something new -- a
		novelty.

				TRAINER
		You's the novelty, Champ!

				APOLLO
		Give my main man a raise!!

Everyone laughs.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now here's what's goin' down.
		Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say
		this but one time.  On January
		first, the first day of the
		Bicentennial I'm gonna fight
		me a local poor underdog, dig?
		A snow-white underdog.  An'
		I'm gonna put his face on this
		poster with me, hear?  An'
		I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm
		sentimental -- An' all the
		people in the country all
		sentimental, man, an' they'd
		like nothin' better than me,
		Apollo Creed, to let some
		unknown get a shot at the
		greatest title in the world on
		this country's biggest birthday.
		Now that's the way I see it
		an' that's the way I want it!!

				JERGENS
		... It's very American.

				APOLLO
		No, man, it's very smart.
 

									34.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Late that afternoon Mr. Gazzo's white 1970 Cadillac pulls up
to Rocky's apartment... Rocky is in the back seat with the
loan shark.  Gazzo's bodyguard is driving.

Gazzo flips through a small black notepad.

				ROCKY
		Next Wednesday I grab a grand
		from Snyder.  An' Thursday two
		yards from Cappoli, okay?

				GAZZO
		No, two yards from Snyder, an'
		a grand from Cappoli.

				ROCKY
		Ya sure?

				GAZZO
		Hey, screw ya brain on right.
		Now, who's this girl you're
		going out with tonight?

				ROCKY
		How'd you know?

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		You think I don't hear things?

				ROCKY
		Paulie's sister.

				BODYGUARD
			(abrasively)
		Hear she's retarded.

				ROCKY
			(dryly)
		She ain't retarded, she's shy.

				BODYGUARD
		Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards
		like the zoo.

				ROCKY
		Does that bum have to say that?

The Bodyguard reddens... Gazzo motions to his Bodyguard to
relax.
 

									35.


				GAZZO
		Buddy's in a bad mood --
		prostate problems.

				ROCKY
		He's always in a bad mood.
			(laughs)
		Count ya blessin's.  Ya a
		healthy person -- ya legs
		work -- ya hands work --

The Bodyguard has been looking at Rocky with murderous eyes.

				BODYGUARD
		I don't like ya face.

				ROCKY
		Don't like yours neither.

				BODYGUARD
		Kiss my ass.

				ROCKY
		Move your shoulders down.

Mr. Gazzo is amused.  He steps out of the car, followed by
Rocky.

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Buddy's got a thing against
		ya, Rock.  Some people just
		hate for no reason, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.

				GAZZO
		Here's fifty bucks -- You an'
		the girl have a nice time.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.

Rocky enters his apartment and Gazzo drives off.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

The SCENE REVERTS BACK TO Miles Jergens' office.  Apollo
pores over a large record book.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Billy Snow?
 

									36.


				JERGENS
		Fouls.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?

				TRAINER
		Too old, dull fighter.
			(points at a name)
		Bobby Judge is a good boy.

				APOLLO
		... I don't feel heat from the
		name.

				JERGENS
		Joe Zack is a good prospect --
		Exciting boy.

				APOLLO
		... Still don't feel no heat.

				JERGENS
			(sighs)
		Exactly what are you looking
		for, Apollo?

				APOLLO
		... This man.

Everybody leans forward.

				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			much amused)
		'The Italian Stallion' -- He's
		my man.

				JERGENS
		Rocky Balboa -- His record's
		poor --

				APOLLO
		Don't matter -- That name.
		'The Italian Stallion,' it's
		right on.
			(laughs)
		Who discovered America?  An
		Italian, right?  So, man, what
		could be better than to get it
		on with one of his ancestors --

				TRAINER
		He won't last one round.
 

									37.


				APOLLO
		Listen, I gonna carry this boy
		three rounds, then drop 'im
		like a bad habit.

				TRAINER
		I don't like you messin' with
		southpaws -- They do everything
		wrong.

				APOLLO
		Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop
		'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed
		meets the Italian Stallion.'
		Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn
		monster movie!!

Everyone laughs.

						FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - DUSK

Rocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is
cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of
half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.)

				ROCKY
			(mimes throwing)
		I usta be deadly at half-ball.

				PAULIE
		I hate the friggin' game...
		I'd like to talk some business.

				ROCKY
		What kinda business?

				PAULIE
		Look at my hands -- See how
		the joints are swollen.

Paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in
		an' out of a freezer carryin'
		meat plays hell on the joints.

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya should see a doctor.
 

									38.


				PAULIE
		I don't need a doctor, I need
		a different job.

				ROCKY
		Maybe another job is the best
		thing.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo.
		Tell him I'm a friend an'
		would do a good job... Tell
		him I ain't bothered by
		nothin' an' would be a great
		collector... Bustin' bones
		don't bother me -- Tell him
		I'm a good worker.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you.

				PAULIE
		I'm askin' ya to go to him --
		As a favor.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you --
		Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job --
		Do what you do now.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK

They continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group
of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front.

Rocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the
night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky.

Marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the
opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch
quarters.

Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.

				PAULIE
		You know her?

Rocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night
air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS.

EXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a
dimly-lit four story walk-up.
 

									39.


				ROCKY
		Ya sister knows I'm comin'?

				PAULIE
		Yeah, sure -- She's very
		excited.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky
stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen.
A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on.

She stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled
by Rocky's unexpected presence.

				ADRIAN
			(weakly)
		Paulie, you're late.

She looks at Rocky again.

				PAULIE
		Did you call the hospital?
			(to Rocky)
		If I'm ten minutes late, she
		calls the hospital.

Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie
follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears.

OVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from
the TELEVISION.

				COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
		... Unfortunate luck for
		fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac
		Lee Green.  The slugging
		fighter acquired a serious
		fracture in his left hand
		after an aggressive day of
		sparring -- Champion Apollo
		Creed says he'll be 'shopping
		for another victim,' to fill
		Green's vacancy for the
		Bicentennial Championship
		Fight to be held in Philly
		next month... By the way,
		rumor has it that this will be
		the most widely-viewed sporting
		event in the entire world --
		and that includes the Super
		Bowl, folks... Today U.S.
		swimmers set a new...
 

									40.


Meanwhile, the argument between brother and sister continues
in the bedroom.

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie, why didn't you
		tell me you were bringing him
		home?!  Look at me, I'm not
		ready for this.

				PAULIE
		Like it would make a difference
		if you were, right?  This
		guy's a friend and now he's
		takin' ya out.

				ADRIAN
		No... I can't!

				PAULIE
		Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom
		an' I don't wanna know from
		nothin'.

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, please --

				PAULIE
		Hey, I want ya out
		instamaticly. -- I'm sicka
		lookin' at ya hangin' around
		like a friggin' spider -- Go
		out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life.

				ADRIAN
		... Like you?

				PAULIE
		Don't get wise with me.  I
		want ya to stop bein' a loser.

				ADRIAN
		I can't go out.

				PAULIE
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
		I've gotta turkey in the oven.

Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom... He enters the kitchen.
Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the
turkey... With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork,
Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window.
 

									41.


Adrian has seen this and is shattered.  She runs back into
the bedroom and locks the door.

				PAULIE
		!! Ya want the bird, go out in
		the alley an' eat the bird --
		I want ya outta the house --
		Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya
		hungry, Rock?

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Forget nothin' -- Here, talk
		to my sister, tell 'er
		somethin' nice.

Rocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking
to the enclosed girl.

				ROCKY
		... Yo, Adrian, it's me,
		Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's
		kinda hard for me to think of
		somethin' to say, y'know --
		'Cause I never talked to a
		door before, I mean whatta ya
		say to a door.

Rocky turns away and begins to walk off.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Maybe I better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Try again, c'mon, try again.

Rocky goes over to the door and begins speaking again.

				ROCKY
		Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't
		too happy at this moment, but
		would ya do me a favor -- I
		ain't got nobody to spend
		Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout
		you an' me goin' out -- Get
		somethin' to eat, maybe laugh
		a little, who knows... Would
		ya like, I dunno, go out
		together?

Adrian opens the door... She already has her winter coat on.
 

									42.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		We'll have a good time.

Paulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging
smile...

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's ya sister like to do?

				PAULIE
		Ice skate.

				ROCKY
		I didn't want no turkey anyway.

				ADRIAN
		It's Thanksgiving.

				ROCKY
		To you, to me it's Thursday.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink.

				ROCKY
		Looks quiet, y'know.

				ADRIAN
		I think it's closed.

				ROCKY
		I think mebbe we're early or
		somethin' --

From across the rink a CLEANING MAN yells at them.

				CLEANER
		Hey, whatta ya doin' here --
		we're closed... Yo, we're
		closed!

				ROCKY
			(yells back)
		Are ya closed to the General
		Public or to just everybody.
 

									43.


				CLEANER
			(starts to walk over)
		Hey, the rink is empty 'cause
		we're closed -- ya ain't
		allowed in here so do me a
		favor an' not stay here.

				ROCKY
		Wait here, gotta smooth this
		guy out.

				ADRIAN
			(softly)
		We could go somewhere else
		an' --

Rocky approaches the Cleaner.

				CLEANER
		Yo, pal, what's with you --
		The place ain't operatin'.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I gotta problem.  This
		girl ain't feelin' well,
		y'know -- The doctor says she
		should exercise, y'know once
		in awhile an' ice skatin' is
		the best thing --

				CLEANER
		This a con?

				ROCKY
		Look at her, ya can see she
		ain't feelin' good -- needs a
		few minutes exercise --

				CLEANER
		Few minutes?

				ROCKY
		... Ten minutes.

				CLEANER
		Ten minutes for ten dollars.

				ROCKY
		... Yeah, give 'er the Blades.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Adrian has on skates.  Rocky follows her onto the ice.  He
wears street shoes.
 

									44.


				ADRIAN
		... Aren't you skating?

				ROCKY
		Ain't skated since I was
		fifteen -- That's when I
		started fightin' -- gotta
		watch the ankles.  Yeah,
		fightin' use to be tops with
		me, but no more.  All I wanted
		to prove was I weren't no
		bum -- That I had the stuff to
		make a good pro.

				ADRIAN
		And you never got the chance?

The Cleaner yells from the sideline.

				CLEANER
		Nine minutes!

				ROCKY
		Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still
		fight.  Kinda do it like a
		hobby.  See I'm a natural
		southpaw an' most pugs won't
		fight a southpaw 'cause we
		mess up their timin' an' look
		awkward -- Southpaw means
		lefthanded... But I guess in
		the long run things probably
		worked out for the best, right?

				ADRIAN
		But you never had a chance to
		prove yourself.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CLEANER
		Eight minutes!

Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall.

				ROCKY
		I just dislocated my finger.

				ADRIAN
		Ohh!

				CLEANER
		Seven minutes!
 

									45.


				ROCKY
		It ain't your fault -- I
		originally done it in the Baby
		Crenshaw fight.
			(opens his wallet)
		That's me fightin' Big Baby
		Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the
		size of an airplane an' I
		broke my hands on his head --
		I lost, but it's a nice
		picture, don't ya think?

				CLEANER
		Six!

				ROCKY
		How 'bout some Cokes?

				CLEANER
		Cost ya a buck.

				ROCKY
		This guy is beautiful -- get
		the Cokes.

Adrian does a slight turn and Rocky has to speed up and
nearly falls.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		See, I ain't graceful,
		y'know -- I don't move good --
		Stink as a dancer too -- But I
		can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw
		an' nobody wants to fight a
		southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?

Adrian nods and is very nervous... The Cleaner moves
carefully across the ice.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Y'know how I got started in
		the fight racket?

				ADRIAN
		By accident?

				CLEANER
		Here -- Three minutes.
 

									46.


				ROCKY
		Yeah -- My ol' man who was
		never the sharpest told me --
		I weren't born with much brain
		so I better use my body.

For the first time, Adrian laughs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's funny?

				ADRIAN
		My mother told me just the
		opposite.  She said, 'You
		weren't born with much of a
		body so you'd better develop
		your brain.'

				CLEANER
		Time!

The Cleaner walks over as Rocky and Adrian get off the ice.

				CLEANER
			(continuing)
		That's ten bucks.

				ROCKY
		I must be goin' deaf 'cause I
		thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

Rocky hands him a dime.

				CLEANER
			(weakly)
		... How 'bout for the Cokes?

				ROCKY
		Charge it.

Rocky and Adrian start to leave.  Rocky pauses at the door
and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Had ya goin', didn't I, huh?

He grins and leaves.
 

									47.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

				ROCKY
		Some people are very shy by
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		I would say you're very shy bu
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		Some people think bein' shy is
		a disease, but it don't bother
		me.

				ADRIAN
		It doesn't bother me either.

				ROCKY
		Then why did I bother bringin'
		it up?  'Cause I'm dumb,
		that's why... Y'know, I think
		we make a real sharp coupla
		coconuts -- I'm dumb an'
		you're shy.

				ADRIAN
		... It is just hard for me to
		understand why anybody wants
		to be a fighter.

				ROCKY
		Ya gotta be a little soft to
		wanna be a pug... It's a
		racket where ya' almost
		guaranteed to end up a bum.

				ADRIAN
		I don't think you're a bum.

				ROCKY
		... I'm at least half a bum.
		Yeah, fightin' is a crazy
		racket.  The roughest part is
		the mornin' after.

				ADRIAN
		Morning after?
 

									48.


				ROCKY
		After a rough fight, ya'
		nothin' but a large wound.
		Sometimes I feel like callin'
		a taxi to drive me from my bed
		to the bathroom... Ya' eyes
		hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair
		even hurts... But the thing
		I'm proud of is I been in over
		sixty fights an' never had a
		busted nose -- Bent an'
		twisted an' bitten but never
		broke... That's rare.

				ADRIAN
		Why do you do it if it hurts
		so bad?

				ROCKY
		... Guess.

				ADRIAN
			(pause)
		'Cause you can't sing or dance?

Rocky smiles.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment... She is
nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room...
Rocky goes to the icebox.

				ROCKY
		Would ya like a glass of water?

				ADRIAN
		... No thanks.

Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees
a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and
smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is
reflected in the mirror.

He turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the
turtle bowl.

				ROCKY
		Here's the guys I was tellin'
		ya about -- This is Cuff an'
		Link.

				ADRIAN
		I sold them to you.
 

									49.


				ROCKY
			(very embarrassed)
		... Oh, yeah, I bought the
		whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me
		the turtles, the bowl, an' the
		mountain -- I had to get rid
		of the mountain 'cause they
		kept fallin' off.

				ADRIAN
		Do you have a phone?

				ROCKY
		I had it pulled.  People
		callin' all the time.  Who
		needs it -- Who'd you wanna
		call?

				ADRIAN
		I wanna let my brother know
		where I am.

				ROCKY
		D'you really wanna call?

				ADRIAN
		Yes, I do.

				ROCKY
		You sure?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		I think he might be worried.

				ROCKY
		I'll call your brother.

Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's
		with me!  I'll call ya later.

Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not
smiling.  She looks frightened.
 

									50.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's the matter?  Ya don't
		like the room?

				ADRIAN
		It's fine.

				ROCKY
		It's only temporary.

				ADRIAN
		It's not that --

				ROCKY
		What's the problem?  You don't
		like me -- Don't like the
		turtles -- What is it?

				ADRIAN
		I don't think I belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's okay.

				ADRIAN
		No, I don't belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's all right -- You're my
		guest.

				ADRIAN
		... I've never been in a man's
		apartment before.

				ROCKY
			(gesturing)
		They're all the same.

				ADRIAN
		I'm not sure I know you well
		enough -- I don't think I'm
		comfortable.

				ROCKY
		Yo, I'm not comfortable either.

				ADRIAN
			(standing)
		I should leave.
 

									51.


				ROCKY
		But I'm willin' to make the
		best of this uncomfortable
		situation.

Adrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; softly)
		Would ya take off your glasses?

				ADRIAN
			(dumbstruck)
		What?

				ROCKY
		The glasses... Please.

Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes.

				ADRIAN
			(timidly)
		... T-thank you.

				ROCKY
		Do me another favor?

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		Could ya take off that hat.

After a moment, Adrian removes the hat... She is becoming
rather pretty.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I always knew you was pretty.

				ADRIAN
		Don't tease me.

The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing...
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body.

				ROCKY
		I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
		have to kiss me back if ya
		don't feel like it.

Rocky softly kisses the woman... Her arms hang limp.  He
puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond.
Her hand glides like smoke up his back.
 

									52.


She embraces his neck.  The dam of passion erupts.  She
gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.

EXT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The following day, Rocky strolls down the street to
Goldmill's Gym... Out front a group of young blacks stop
talking and study Rocky as he passes.  Rocky's eyebrows knit
in confusion.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym...

... In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the
athletes stare in wonderment... The big black heavyweight
contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and
turns away.

Mike quietly approaches Rocky.

				MIKE
		Hey, Rock -- What happened?

				ROCKY
		'Bout what?

Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office...

				MICKEY
		Did ya get the message, kid?

				ROCKY
		Message -- What message?

Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket... He hands
it to Rocky.

				MICKEY
		A Rep from Miles Jergens'
		Promotions was lookin' for
		ya -- They need sparrin'
		partners for Creed.

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on?

				MICKEY
		Here's the card?

				ROCKY
		When was they here?
 

									53.


				MICKEY
		'Bout an hour ago.

				ROCKY
		Probably lookin' for sparrin'
		partners.

				MICKEY
		... I said that before.

Rocky turns from Mickey and jogs out of the gym.  Mickey
fumbles with his rosary beads.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		... Waste of life.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Rocky steps off a bus in mid-town Philadelphia.  He hurries
down Broad Street.  Every few steps he breaks into a trot...
He enters a skyscraper.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - HALL - DAY

Rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of Miles
Jergens' Productions.

INT. JERGENS' PRODUCTIONS - DAY

The SECRETARY is slightly startled by Rocky's excited
expression.

				SECRETARY
		May I help you?

Rocky hands her the business card.

				SECRETARY
			(continuing)
		Your name, please?

				ROCKY
		Balboa, Rocky Balboa.

The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes
the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls.

The Secretary returns.

				SECRETARY
		You may go in.

Rocky collects himself and enters...
 

									54.


INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Miles Jergens warmly greets him.

				JERGENS
		Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles
		Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

				ROCKY
		... Thanks.

				JERGENS
		Mr. Balboa --

				ROCKY
			(overriding)
		Rocky.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, do you have any
		representation?  A manager?

				ROCKY
		No -- Just me.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in --

				ROCKY
		Sparrin'?

				JERGENS
		Excuse me.

				ROCKY
		I know ya need sparrin'
		partners -- I'm very available.

				JERGENS
		I'm sure you are.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely -- Sparrin' with
		the Champ would be an honor --
		y'know what?

				JERGENS
		What?

				ROCKY
		I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
		I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
 

									55.


Jergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in fighting Apollo Creed for
		the Championship?

				ROCKY
		... Like I said, I'd make a
		boss sparrin' mate.

				JERGENS
		Did you hear what I said?

				ROCKY
		Sure, an' I'm smart enough to
		know that no sparrin' partner
		should take cheap shots at the
		Champ.  He's just there to
		help condition the man.

				JERGENS
		Not spar, I'm asking whether
		you would be interested in
		fighting Creed for the
		championship.

The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky.
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case
as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses.

				ROCKY
		... Ah... Absolutely.

The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and
white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to
Apollo being interviewed.

				REPORTER #1
		How'd you like the 'City of
		Brotherly Love?'

				APOLLO
		I like my Philadelphia Brothers.
		An' I'm patriotic!

Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting
microphone.
 

									56.


				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			mock seriousness)
		If yo' don't back up I'm gonna
		send yo' home with a microphone
		in yo' nose!

The Reporters laugh.

				REPORTER #2
		Why did you agree to fight a
		man who has virtually no
		chance of winning?

				APOLLO
		If history proves one thing,
		everybody gotta chance --
		Didn't yo' all ever hear of
		David an' Goliath? -- 'Course
		I woulda knocked out Goliath.

				REPORTER #3
		It is a coincidence that
		you're fighting a white man on
		the most celebrated day in the
		country's history?

				APOLLO
		The same coincidence that he's
		fightin' a black man.

				REPORTER #1
		What're your feelings about
		the challenger?

				APOLLO
		He's Italian.

				REPORTER #1
		What does that mean?

				APOLLO
		It means if he can't fight, I
		bet he can cook!

Rocky and Adrian laugh at the interview... Paulie, her
brother, takes offense.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- His lungs,
		punch 'em out.

				ADRIAN
		Paul.
 

									57.


Rocky's interview now fills the screen.  Rocky squints and
looks nervous under the hot lights.

				REPORTER #2
		This is your largest payday
		ever -- How do you feel about
		it?

				ROCKY
		Feel?  I dunno... Happy.

				REPORTER #2
		How will you fight Apollo Creed?

				ROCKY
			(mind elsewhere)
		Creed's great, ain't he...
		I'll do what I can.

				REPORTER #1
		Where did you get the name,
		'Italian Stallion?'

				ROCKY
		I thought of it 'bout eight
		years ago, when I was eatin'
		dinner.

				REPORTER #2
		Is it true the most you've
		ever made in a prizefight is
		five hundred dollars?

				ROCKY
		Four hundred -- But that was a
		long time ago.

				REPORTER #2
		And now your payday will be
		one hundred and fifty thousand
		dollars.  Any comment?

				ROCKY
		Listen, I wanna say hi to my
		girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!

Adrian blushes and laughs.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky!

				PAULIE
			(dry)
		Christ.
 

									58.


				ADRIAN
		You didn't!

				ROCKY
		Sure I did.  You heard.

They continue to watch the remainder of the interview... The
head COMMENTATOR is looking directly into the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		A Bicentennial Fight --
		January first.  It will be the
		first sporting event on our
		two hundredth birthday and is
		already being called by many
		the greatest farce in sports
		history.  If this man lasts
		more than a minute I would say
		he's on borrowed time.
			(sarcastically)
		It's matches like this with
		their exorbitant prices that
		give sports a bad name -- Not
		only is this match bad,
		people, it's sad!  Why a Rocky
		Balboa?  At the State Athletic
		Commission, Larry Duggan
		reporting.

				PAULIE
			(irate)
		The guy's a friggin' moron.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				PAULIE
		Don't it matter none he's
		makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd
		break his lips.

				ROCKY
		It don't matter.

				PAULIE
		He's takin' cheap shots.

				ROCKY
		It don't bother me none.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be
		lookin' for people to help,
		right?
 

									59.


				ROCKY
		Help what?

				PAULIE
		Y'know, to help keep ya livin'
		clean.

				ROCKY
		I'll do okay.

				PAULIE
		Ya gotta have a guy help ya
		exercise, mebbe somebody to be
		standin' by with a towel or
		run errands, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Hey, who cared about me
		yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I
		think I'm gonna train myself.

				PAULIE
		Without havin' good people
		around, ya won't have such a
		good chance.

Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude.
She faces him.

				ADRIAN
		Einstein flunked out of
		school... twice.

				PAULIE
		That so.

				ADRIAN
		Roosevelt finished last in his
		class -- Beethoven was deaf,
		an' Helen Keller was blind --
		I think Rocky has a good chance.

INT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her.

				ROCKY
		See ya tomorrow.

Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he
converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE
ECHOES up the stairwell.
 

									60.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How'd ya like hearin' ya name
		on TV?

				ADRIAN
		I don't know -- I was shocked.
		Why did you do that?

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on, right?

				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		Absolutely -- What time should
		I expect you?

				ROCKY
		'Bout seven.

				ADRIAN
		I'll be waiting.

Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the
top floor landing.

				ROCKY
		Y'know how I said that stuff
		on television didn't bother me?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		It did.

As Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and
slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front.
They are eating hot sandwiches.

				ROCKY
		Y'know I won't be able to work
		for ya no more.

				GAZZO
		Hey -- if a good man can make
		a better life, let him make it.

				ROCKY
		I feel bad about walkin'.
 

									61.


				GAZZO
		Take your shot, kid -- You got
		money for trainin' expenses?

				ROCKY
		A few bucks.

Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.

				GAZZO
		Here's five hundred -- Put it
		in your glove.

				ROCKY
		Do I have to pay juice?

Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"

Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at
the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Does Santa Claus charge juice?
		Merry Christmas -- Now, how's
		about my present, ya gonna win?

				ROCKY
		Gonna try.

				GAZZO
		Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya
		know, I'm with ya -- Italian,
		we're blood.  You kill this
		rug -- We Guinneas gotta show
		these Afro-Americans where
		it's at.  Give it your best
		shot cause I want ya to prove
		to these bums on the corner
		that my man can't be beat by
		this rug... Ya got any action
		on the side.

				ROCKY
		No action.

				GAZZO
		Ya gettin 150 grand killer.
		Ya got any plans for it?
		Whatta ya think?
				(MORE)
 

									62.


				GAZZO (CONT'D)
		Ya like to put it on the
		street, make it work for ya?

				ROCKY
		I'm gonna do somethin with it.

				GAZZO
		Sure, you do what ya want.
		Stay away from the stock market.

				ROCKY
		Black market?

				GAZZO
		Same thing.  Ya know, Rock,
		remember when we was kids, we
		fought together.  An' I wasn't
		well an' ya had to beat up
		that Irish kid -- what's his
		name? -- Gallager -- I bought
		a suit and became a businessman.
		You put on gloves.  An' I
		remember Mama almost cried,
		may she rest in peace -- an'
		our ol' man who said ya had no
		brains -- I'd like to lay
		hands on that bastard.  You
		ain't never had any luck.
		Even when I owned you in '66
		you never had luck.  But now I
		think you might be gettin'
		some luck kid.  Whatta you
		think?

Rocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car.  Rocky follows him
across the street.

				ROCKY
		Yo, you gonna show, Tony?

				GAZZO
		Where else am I gonna go.
			(to Bodyguard)
		Bet three grand on Rocky.

				BODYGUARD
		He's a bum -- are you kiddin?

				GAZZO
			(slaps Bodyguard)
		No!  I'm not kiddin!

Rocky walks away.
 

									63.


INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning
on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds
the turtles.

				ROCKY
		Look who's home!

Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He
approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one.
Settling on the bed, he reads the other.

A KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill,
the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.

				MICKEY
			(stiffly)
		I seen the light.  I figure
		somebody was home.

				ROCKY
		Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
		here?  Here, sit down.

Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Best seat in the house -- Hey,
		Mick, this is too much.

				MICKEY
		How do you mean?

				ROCKY
		I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
		but seein' ya here, in my
		house, it's kinda outta joint.

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
something important is preying on his mind.

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
having outsiders see how he lives.

				MICKEY
		Listen, Rock, you're a very
		lucky guy.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.
 

									64.


				MICKEY
		What's happened is freak luck.

				ROCKY
		Freak luck for sure.

				MICKEY
		Look at all them other fighters.
		Real good boys.  Good records.
		Colorful.  Fight their hearts
		out for peanuts -- But who
		cared?  Nobody.  They got it
		shoved in their back door.
		Nobody ever give them a shot
		at the title...

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		Freak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles.

				MICKEY
		Whatta' those?

				ROCKY
		Turtles -- domestic turtles.

				MICKEY
			(businesslike)
		I'm here tellin' ya to be very
		smart with this shot.  Like
		the Bible sez, ya don't get no
		second chance.

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya need a manager.  An advisor.
		I been in the racket fifty
		years.  I done it all, there
		ain't nothin' about the world
		of pugilism that ain't livin'
		up here.

He lights a half-smoked cigar.

				ROCKY
			(at a loss)
		Fifty years, huh.
 

									65.


				MICKEY
			(stronger)
		Fifty years.  The rep is known
		around Philly, an' a good rep
		can't be bought, but I don't
		have to tell you that.

				ROCKY
		How 'bout a glass of water?

				MICKEY
		Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		... What?

				MICKEY
			(driving each
			word hard)
		I done it all.  I've done an'
		seen everything'.  Believe
		what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya
		shoulda seen the night in
		Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'
		Russo outta the ring, September
		14, 1923 -- same night Firpo
		knocked Dempsey outta the ring.
		But who got the Press?  He did.
		He had a manager -- September
		14, 1923.

				ROCKY
			(softly)
		Ya got a good mind for dates.

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.

				MICKEY
		Look at this face -- twenty-
		one stitches over the left
		eye, thirty-four over the
		right -- my nose was busted
		seventeen times, the last
		being the Sailor Mike fight
		New Year's Eve, 1940, in
		Camden, New Jersey -- What a
		professional pastin' I give
		him.  Here, read about it.
				(MORE)
 

									66.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
			(shows a tiny
			press clipping;
			points to
			cauliflower ear)
		An' he give me the vegetable
		on the ear.  I got pain an'
		experience... an' you got
		heart -- kinda remind me of
		Marciano, ya do.

Rocky points to his most prized possession.

				ROCKY
		Nobody ever said that --
		There's his picture.

				MICKEY
		Yeah, ya kinda remind me of
		the Rock.  Ya move like 'im.

Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more
than being compared to his idol.

				ROCKY
		Really think so?

				MICKEY
		Ya got heart.

				ROCKY
		Heart, but I ain't got no
		Tocker.

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
crouch.

				MICKEY
		Christ, I know this business.
		Rocky, when I was fightin' it
		was the dirtiest racket goin',
		see.  Pugs like me was treated
		like fightin' dogs -- throw ya
		in the pit an' for ten bucks
		ya try to kill each other.  We
		had no management...
				(MORE)
 

									67.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		fought in boxcars, in
		whorehouse basements, any
		joint with a floor -- October
		1931 I fought a bum who put a
		tack in the thumb of his glove
		an' punched so many holes in
		my face I had spit shootin'
		outta my cheeks -- I never had
		no manager watchin' out for
		me -- See that picture outside
		the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'
		that's me in my prime.  I had
		all the tools.  I coulda
		starched any lightweight husky
		on the East Coast -- But I had
		no management.  Nobody ever
		got to know how slick I was,
		but I had a head for business
		an' stashed a few bucks an'
		opened the gym -- It's a dirt
		hole, I know it, but that an'
		a lotta scars is what I got to
		show for fifty years in the
		business, kid -- now you come
		along with this shot an' I
		feel like it's me gettin' the
		shot I never got... Yeah, we
		was treated like dogs -- like
		them Dago's, no offense, in
		the Colosseum in Rome there --
		An' now I got all this
		knowledge, I wanna give it to
		ya so I can protect ya an'
		make sure ya get the best deal
		ya can!

Rocky rises and opens a window.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Respect, I always dished ya
		respect.

				ROCKY
		... Ya gave Dipper my locker.

				MICKEY
			(almost begging)
		I'm sorry, I -- I made a
		mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man
		to man.  I wanna be ya manager.
 

									68.


				ROCKY
		The fight's set -- I don't
		need a manager.

				MICKEY
		Look, you can't buy what I
		know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it
		all!  I got pain an' I got
		experience.

				ROCKY
		I got pain an' experience too.

				MICKEY
		Please, kid.

				ROCKY
			(tightly)
		Whatever I got, I always got
		on the slide.  This shot's no
		different.  I didn't earn
		nothin' -- I got it on the
		slide... I needed ya help
		about ten years ago when I was
		startin', but ya never helped
		me none.

Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He
remains on one knee.

				MICKEY
		If ya was wantin' my help, why
		didn't ya ask?  Just ask.

				ROCKY
		I asked, but ya never helped
		nothin'! -- Like the Bible
		sez, ya don't get no second
		chance.

				MICKEY
			(yells)
		Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
		old.  Maybe you can be the
		winner I never was -- your
		shot is my last shot!

Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
door.

Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.

Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
 

									69.


EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his
shoulder.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with
great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter.

At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills
the basin and submerges his face in cold water.

Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He
cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
swill... his body quivers.

EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

Rocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and
his steaming breath attests to the cold.

He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
street lamps.

Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN

Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
of stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
into the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
legs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the
stairs.

EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN

Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,
heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several
lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
aching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe
with amusement.

Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
 

									70.


EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN

Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
elevated train station.  The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
blend perfectly with his muscular running style.

EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

The sky is beginning to lighten.  The fighter now runs along
the piers and past anchored freighters.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
belonging to Eastern Packing Company.  Alongside the loading
platform come several boxcars.

Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door.  It soon
opens and Paulie guides him inside.  Paulie is drunk.

INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY

				PAULIE
		How ya feelin'?

				ROCKY
			(panting)
		... Tight.

				PAULIE
		I got whiskey here.

				ROCKY
		... No.

Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.

				PAULIE
		This is the guy who's fightin'
		Apollo Creed.

				JOSE
			(heavy accent)
		Good luck -- Kill him, man.

				PAULIE
			(as though
			rehearsed badly)
		Hip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --
		Hip -- Hip --
 

									71.


				JOSE
			(walks away)
		Hooray, man.

				PAULIE
		Rock'll be comin' by every
		mornin' to pick up some
		Prime -- can't train on that
		store crap.

Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.

INT. FREEZER - DAY

They enter.  The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
darkness to the far end of the refrigerator.  The blower
overhead causes the men to speak loudly.

				PAULIE
			(teasing)
		If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
		up hangin' on the hook, right?

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's a good man.

				PAULIE
		How 'bout you talk to 'em
		about me?
			(tightly)
		Please do me that favor.

				ROCKY
		Keep this job, ya eat better.

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat.  He
swills whiskey from a pint bottle.

				PAULIE
		Y'know, d'ya think you an' my
		sister -- Ah, doin' good
		together?

				ROCKY
		Whatta you think?

				PAULIE
		Ain't sure, what's the story?

				ROCKY
		What?
 

									72.


				PAULIE
		The story -- what's happenin'?

Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
quite a while.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Ya really like her?

				ROCKY
		Sure I like her.

				PAULIE
			(nervous laughter)
		What's the attraction?  I
		don't see it?

				ROCKY
		I dunno -- she fills gaps.

				PAULIE
		What gaps?

				ROCKY
			(shrugs and
			takes meat)
		She got gaps.  I got gaps --
		together we fill the gaps.

				PAULIE
			(sharply)
		You ballin' her?

				ROCKY
			(turns around)
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

				PAULIE
			(tersely)
		C'mon, ya screwin' her?

From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.

				ROCKY
		That's why I can't put ya
		together with Gazzo, cause ya
		talk too much -- big mouth.

Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a
hanging beef.
 

									73.


The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
responds.

Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.

The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.

Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
though he were locked in total battle.

				PAULIE
		Hit the rump.  The rump!
		Ya'll break the ribs!

Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark
recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his
POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.

Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef
swings and appears surrealistically alive.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		We do that to Creed an'
		they'll take us to jail for
		murder.

Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to
the elbows with beef blood.

Paulie hands him a package of beef.

				ROCKY
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes
reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING.
Rocky pounds a heavy bag.

Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
pocket.
 

									74.


				MICKEY
			(passionate)
		Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
		It's clumsy.  You're off
		balance.

He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the
string.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
		two feet slack.

				ROCKY
		I never had good footwork.

Mike completes the task.

				MICKEY
		Forget the footwork -- You're
		off balance.  The legs are
		sticking everywhere.  Marciano
		had the same problem, an' the
		string cured it.  When you can
		hit and move without breakin'
		the string you'll have balance.

				MIKE
		You'll be a very dangerous
		person.

Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.

				BOY
		Rocky, could we have your
		autograph?

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				MICKEY
			(irate)
		Don't you boys ever interrupt
		when I'm conductin' business,
		or I'll kill you both -- Go
		away.

The boys depart.
 

									75.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Autographs!  Ya wanna be a
		writer or a fighter?  Let's
		work.

Mike looks off across the gym.

				MIKE
		... we got visitors.

Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of REPORTERS and NEWS
CAMERAMEN entering his gym.

				MICKEY
			(approaching)
		Can I help you guys?

				REPORTER
			(to Cameraman)
		Set the camera up over there.
			(to Mickey)
		We're from Channel Seven --
		Covering the pre-fight training.

				MICKEY
		I own the place.

The Reporter has a hundred things on his mind... he turns
from Mickey and nods to his crew... the other television
crews rush to set up.

				CAMERAMAN
		Rolling here.

				SOUND MAN
		Speed here.

				REPORTER
			(to the camera)
		We're here at Goldmill's
		Gym -- A Philadelphia landmark
		of sorts since 1929 -- The
		stench of toil permeates every
		corner.  The sweat a trademark
		of a unique profession... Yet,
		the most unique fixture is an
		unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog
		heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa.

The camera turns to Rocky.
 

									76.


				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Should I do this?

Mickey nods and Rocky faces the glaring lights.

				REPORTER
		So much has happened lately --
		Has it changed your life style
		much?

				ROCKY
		... People talk to me more.

				REPORTER
		How're you preparing for this
		Bicentennial bout?

A young punchy fighter yells out:

				FIGHTER
		Readin' fuckin' history books,
		man!

The gym explodes with laughter.

				REPORTER
			(flushed)
		We can cut that out later.
		Apollo Creed says he'll let
		you stay three rounds before
		he puts you away.

				ROCKY
			(honestly)
		Apollo's a great fighter.

				REPORTER
		Do you feel you have a chance?

				ROCKY
		Maybe --

He faces Mickey.  Mickey whispers in his ear.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I'll tear his head off.

				REPORTER
		Do you have anything derogatory
		to say about the Champion?
 

									77.


				ROCKY
		Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great.

Apollo Creed and his entourage enter the gym.

				APOLLO
			(bellowing)
		I am the Champion of the whole
		world!!!

The gym freezes... everyone turns and stares in wonderment...
Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.  He now
realizes it is a publicity stunt.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
			(approaching Rocky)
		Italian Stallion, I come over
		to tell you to be very smart
		an' after this fight donate
		what's gonna be left of your
		body to science, cause after
		this fight what's left won't
		fill a tuna fish can!... So
		beware, Mon Cher!!!

Apollo turns to the cameras... Rocky is speechless.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		This classic fight -- Tha's
		right, this bicentennial
		fight's goin' down in the
		history books 'cause January
		first I'm gonna be the first
		man to bounce another man offa
		the planet Pluto!

Dipper stands in the far ring... the attention Rocky is
receiving makes him a killer.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now I gots a special
		announcement, y'hear.  For the
		first time in alotta years
		this championship fight is
		gonna be on your home T.V.!
		Free -- 'Course that's just
		for Philly -- My present to
		the city...
				(MORE)
 

									78.


				APOLLO (CONT'D)
		Now some ya'll ain't much on
		likin' me, but ya gotta admit
		Apollo Creed is one DAMN
		generous, 100% pure, government
		inspected, Afro-American Folk
		Hero!!!

Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large
snake.  He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky.  He
nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.

Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.

				DIPPER
			(loud)
		Ya nothin', Boy!

Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence... The
television crew faces Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing)
		I say ya nothin'!

				MICKEY
		What's happenin' here?

				DIPPER
		I'm happenin'!  This pig is
		takin' my shot -- I iz a
		contender.  He's nothin'.

				ROCKY
			(dumbstruck)
		Yo', Dipper, why're ya --

				DIPPER
			(shaking his fist)
		Spar me in front of these here
		TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to
		Jersey!

Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper
slaps them soul style.

				MICKEY
			(to Dipper)
		You can forget about sparring,
		kid.

				DIPPER
		Yo' know I iz the best man
		here!  Yo' said so yoself!
 

									79.


				MICKEY
			(almost
			apologetically
			to the crew)
		Why let Rocky here take a
		chance on cuttin' or breakin'
		a hand? -- Take a shower,
		Dipper.

				DIPPER
		Don't mouth me, old man, I'll
		knock yo' out too.  C'mon,
		wop, spar me, let everybody
		see who's got the heat around
		here.

Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The
scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew
slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.

				DIPPER
			(continuing; insanely)
		Man, yo' best keep them
		cameras out!  Fight me, boy!
		Let Creed here see the kind of
		punk he's fightin'!

Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky.

				MIKE
		Don't chance it, man -- He's
		sick.

				MICKEY
		This is gettin' outta hand --
		Rocky will fight in the ring
		January first, not here!

				DIPPER
		Yo' yellow, old man.

				MICKEY
		Not yellow, cautious.
			(to the crew)
		See, it's very easy for a
		fighter to accidentally hurt --

Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard
across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold.
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.
 

									80.


				DIPPER
		If yo're afraid to fight me,
		then get down an' kiss my
		feet, boy.

Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds
before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.

				MICKEY
			(softly)
		Let's take a walk, Rock.
		Please, don't take a chance.
		He wants to hurt you so you
		can't fight.

Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around
his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper
steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.

Mike jumps forward.

				MIKE
		Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
		Back off, scumbag, or I'll
		bite your face!

Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The
room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth
between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and
they begin to ease away.

				DIPPER
		... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles
forward and stands before Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing;
			almost in a whisper)
		... Kiss 'em.

Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's
feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the
shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of
combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD
and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very
gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of
apprehension... He leaves.
 

									81.


Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes
his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.

				MICKEY
		The kid's got cannons -- Print
		that.

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken
figure lying on a dirty gym floor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
				ADRIAN
		Don't you open them anymore?

				ROCKY
		They either say, 'Kill the
		nigger' or 'Hope you die,
		Honky.' -- What ya got in the
		bag?

Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but
lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.

				ADRIAN
		Like?

				ROCKY
		Sharp -- Real nice.

				ADRIAN
		Really -- You don't think
		they're overly feminine?

				ROCKY
		No... Sharp -- You look great.

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath...
Rocky smiles.  His eyes show what he feels for this woman.

				ROCKY
		Adrian, you really look great,
		y'know -- But I can't fool
		around durin' trainin' --
		makes the legs weak.

				ADRIAN
		Don't want weak legs.
 

									82.


				ROCKY
		Can't fool around -- You look
		very great.

				ADRIAN
		-- The legs.

				ROCKY
		Yeah... But I think weak legs
		ain't bad sometimes, y'know.

Rocky approaches in a seductive manner.  Adrian
uncharacteristically removes her sweater.  Underneath is a
T-shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win."

				ADRIAN
		I thought it might be cute.

				ROCKY
		Ya right --
			(laughs)
		Mebbe we best just hold
		hands -- the shirt made me
		feel guilty, y'know.

SCENE FADES.

EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

Rocky is running... for extra weight he carries his huge
dog, Butkus.  After a half a block he sags under the weight,
and laughing, begins to wrestle with the dog on the
pavement... Rocky tries to sneak away from the dog, but
after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the
street.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is early morning and as usual Rocky jogs to the meathouse.
He is followed by his new dog, Butkus.  He is stopped short
when he notices several television news vans parked out front.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

He and the dog enter the freezer area and see several
reporters and men with mini-cameras milling around... Paulie
is waiting for him -- Rocky is upset and goes outside.
Paulie follows.
 

									83.


EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock.  I made a few phone
		calls an' thanks to me ya
		goin' to be a big man --
		Thatta dog?

				ROCKY
		Whatta these guys want?

				PAULIE
		To see ya train.

				ROCKY
		Yo, what's with you? -- It was
		suppose to be private.

				PAULIE
		I thought I was doin' ya a
		favor -- C'mon inside --
		Y'know, my sister really likes
		ya.

Rocky follows Paulie inside.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAY

A REPORTER points in Rocky's direction and suddenly he is
surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned
beside a slab of hanging beef.  The camera lights go on.

				COMMENTATOR
		Just relax, Mr. Balboa --
			(to the camera)
		Today we're here with
		heavyweight challenger, Rocky
		Balboa.  The reason we are
		standing in a refrigerated box
		is that Mr. Balboa has an
		unusual method of training and
		in a moment he is going to
		demonstrate it for our viewing
		audience -- But first, Rocky,
		how did you ever come to train
		in an icebox?

				ROCKY
		Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me
		in one day an' I hit the beef
		here an' liked it -- An' since
		I become a challenger, the
		owner don't mind neither.
 

									84.


				COMMENTATOR
		Is this a common training
		method -- I mean do other
		fighters pound raw meat?

				ROCKY
		I think me and Paulie invented
		it.

				COMMENTATOR
		Would you give us a
		demonstration?

Rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with
incredible intensity... Everyone present is taken aback.
Rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his
hands dripping beef blood.

The Commentator is unnerved and Rocky looks straight into
the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists.

				COMMENTATOR
		... Diane Lewis in the
		meathouse with the Southpaw,
		Rocky Balboa.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Apollo sits behind Jergens' desk.  Jergens is not present.
Four middle-aged and younger types and Creed's lawyer sit
around the desk.  The desk is flowing with forms and charts.

				APOLLO
		How much is being channeled
		into West Coast closed-circuit
		advertising?

				LAWYER
		Three hundred thousand.

				APOLLO
		Make it four hundred an' fifty.
			(to younger man)
		Send two hundred roses to the
		mayor's wife from me, get a
		picture an' make sure it gets
		all the papers.

				BUSINESSMAN #3
		Do ya want to run the fifteen
		radio spots in the mid-west?
		I think you could spend the
		money better in Canadian
		publicity.
 

									85.


				APOLLO
		Yeah, I'd like to get Canada --
		see, if we can get a tax
		break -- Gimme the figures on
		the Program Concession.

Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened
corner looking at a small television.  He is watching
Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news...

He waves at Apollo.

				TRAINER
			(worried)
		Apollo, you oughta come see
		this boy you're gonna fight on
		TV -- looks like he means
		business.

Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork.

				APOLLO
		I mean business, too --
			(to men)
		The gross rental of the arena
		is gonna include the four
		hundred ushers, right? --
		Gimme some coffee.

EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT

It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street
and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a
chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen.

He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills
the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES
traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens
and he staggers towards the bedroom.

He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a
crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the
otherwise darkened room.

				ADRIAN
		... And he called the
		reporters --

				ROCKY
		Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
 

									86.


				ADRIAN
		Don't be mad at him -- He just
		wants to help.

				ROCKY
		Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just
		outta joint when reporters are
		around -- They take cheap
		shots an' Paulie knows it.

				ADRIAN
		... Are you going to say
		anything to him?

				ROCKY
		... What's to say?  I dunno
		what he wants from me --

Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the
room.

				PAULIE
		Nothin'!  I want nothin' from
		you!!!

				ADRIAN
		Paulie!

				PAULIE
		Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I
		ain't no charity case!  Get
		outta my house!

				ADRIAN
		It's not your house --

				PAULIE
		You ain't no friend no more --
		Go home!  Outta my house I
		want ya!

				ADRIAN
		Don't talk like that to him!

				PAULIE
		Get outta my life both of ya's.

Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be
bordering on a nervous breakdown.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Outta my house I want ya!!
 

									87.


				ROCKY
		... It's cold outside, Paulie.

Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball
bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow.

				PAULIE
		I don't want ya messin' up my
		sister no more -- He's scum
		from the corner, I don't raise
		ya to hang with no bum!

Adrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(continuing;
			raising the bat)
		... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon --
		C'mon, I'll break both ya arms
		so's they never work...

Rocky freezes...

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie.  Stop now!

				PAULIE
		I want 'im outta here --
			(to Rocky)
		Don't think I'm good enough to
		work for Gazzo?
			(spits)
		That's what I think of bums
		like you an' Gazzo!
			(spits again)
		You're goin' up an' don't care
		enough to throw Paulie some
		crumbs!
			(spits)
		I give ya meat, an' I give ya
		my sister, too!

				ADRIAN
		Only a pig would say that!

Paulie smashes a small table with the bat.

				PAULIE
			(to Adrian)
		You forget what I went through
		to give ya the best.
 

									88.


				ADRIAN
		You gave me what?!  Knots!
		You gave me knots in here
		every day -- you made me
		scared of everything!

				PAULIE
		I always seen ya had the best,
		but did ya ever think of
		puttin' in a good word for me
		with this scumbag!

Paulie smashes a large lamp with the bat.

				ADRIAN
		Don't do that again!

				PAULIE
		Get away from me -- I could
		never even get married 'cause
		you couldn't live by yaself --
		ya'd die by yaself!  So
		instead I put you two
		together -- Did ya think of
		puttin' in a good word for
		me? -- You owe me!

				ADRIAN
		Owe you what?

				PAULIE
		You owe me an' are supposed to
		treat me good!

				ADRIAN
		Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've
		been treatin' you like a baby.
		Since I can't remember it's so
		long -- I'm the only one who
		feeds you an' puts you in bed
		when ya can't stand up -- and
		it's you that made me feel
		like a loser -- That's what ya
		use to call me 'Loser' -- What
		kind of name is that?  So can
		ya blame me for not remembering
		to talk about you when I'm
		with Rocky -- I don't owe you,
		Paulie, you owe me.

The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat.

				PAULIE
		You busted?!
 

									89.


				ADRIAN
		What?!

				PAULIE
		You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in
		ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya
		pulled down ya pants an' let
		him have it, didn't ya!!

Mortified, Adrian runs to her room... Rocky steps to Paulie.

				ROCKY
			(fuming)
		Hey --

Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses... Rocky remains still.

				PAULIE
			(softly)
		... I can't haul meat no more.

				ROCKY
		What can I do about it?

				PAULIE
		Christ, I been beggin' ya for
		a break until I'm sick inside.

				ROCKY
		What break?  Huh?  What break!
		Who am I to give breaks!  I'm
		a fighter, you haul meat.  You
		do what you do an' I do what I
		do best -- that's it -- that's
		life, man!

Paulie looks ashamed... Rocky walks, then returns.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... An' what ya said to my
		girlfriend ain't right -- Do
		it again, I'll kill ya.

Rocky goes into the bedroom... Adrian has buried her face in
a pillow... She is rocking slightly.  Rocky cradles her and
kisses her cheek.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Wanna hear a dirty joke?
 

									90.


				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		... Yes --

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room
is dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is
watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky
watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like
a huge dancer around the ring.

				MICKEY
		His defense is great, can't
		lie 'bout that -- You have a
		rollin' style.  Can't retreat
		as fast -- But your style
		ain't retreatin'.

They both watch the flickering images.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		See how he plays sometimes --
		Drives his cornermen nuts.
		Nobody knows his next move --
		Him included.

They watch more action... Creed has a fighter helpless
against the ropes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Killer instinct -- Ya both got
		the killer touch.  Interestin'.
		See that! -- Right-cross
		combination.  Beautiful.  But
		you got the power to rip the
		body.

They watch more action.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Rocky, when ya climb into the
		square, an' know ya' meetin'
		the best fighter in the world,
		ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna
		be ready 'cause I been waitin'
		for fifty years -- Fifty years.
		When I'm done with you, you'll
		gonna be able to spit nails.
				(MORE)
 

									91.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		You'll gonna be able to eat
		lightin' and crap thunder --
		You'll be a very, very
		dangerous person...

The SCENE FADES on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring
transfixed at the images projecting on the wall...

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration.
As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - LATER

Rocky now works on the incline situp board... While doing
situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell.
The pain is evident on his face.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders...
Mickey coaching drives him on.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around
the ring swinging at them.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression
is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats
Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball...
Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky
heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and
Mickey nods.

				MICKEY
		What cha say, Benny -- Meet
		'The Rock.' This is our
		cutman, Benny Stein.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Benny.

				MICKEY
		Check the eyes, Ben.
 

									92.


Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes.

				BENNY
		Ain't bad.  Seen worse --
		Cover up an' things should be
		okay.

				MICKEY
		Take a shower.

Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie
who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room
entrance.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock, I think I found an
		angle to make some bread usin'
		ya name, ya mind?

Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods
'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie
strides off.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Running... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled.
Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY

It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a
huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens...
Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending
stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing
the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at
the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells
with pride... He is ready.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky
is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated
behind his wide desk.

				MAYOR
		Sit down, Rocky.

Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him.
 

									93.


				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I've been going over your
		record -- You've been the busy
		type --
			(reading)
		Nineteen arrests -- probation
		three times -- expelled from
		seven public schools in 1964
		and '65.

Rocky tries to sink into the chair.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I'm a very busy man, but I
		just wanted to remind you that
		you'll be setting an example
		for thousands of guys like
		yourself and maybe start them
		off in a new direction and
		give our police force a
		break -- I also hope you try
		your very best and bring pride
		to Philadelphia.

				ROCKY
		... I'll try.

The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters.

				MAYOR
		Would you stand up, please.

Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture
is taken three times... The photographer exits.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		Thank you for coming by,
		Rocky -- good luck.

				ROCKY
			(turns)
		Any time.

				MAYOR
			(sitting)
		Wait... After the fight you'll
		have nearly a hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars -- What
		do you plan to do with it?
 

									94.


				ROCKY
			(smiles)
		... Run for mayor.

The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big,
friendly laugh, and Rocky exits.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at
new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian
Stallion or Donkey?" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky
stands with the mayor.

				ADRIAN
		Rocky, do you realize everybody
		in this country knows your
		face, and after the fight
		everybody in the world is
		going to.

				ROCKY
		Yeah...

She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman,
Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other
clippings.

The TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new
white object hanging on the wall.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		My first call... Hello?  Yeah,
		speakin' -- Who is this?
		Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo,
		Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't
		seen ya for nine or eight
		years -- Yeah, things is
		great, how's things with you
		upstate -- Ya sellin' real
		estate, hey, that's a good
		job... Yeah, I gotta advance,
		but I bought ringside seats
		for the guys at the gym.  I
		get the hundred an' fifty
		grand after the fight...

Adrian overhears the statement.
 

									95.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Yeah, I know it's a lotta
		money -- Condominiums?  Nobody
		uses them anybody.  Listen, I
		think a pet shop is a good
		investment, y'know -- I don't
		care 'bout long hours --
		there's no depreciation --
		that don't matter none to
		me -- Yeah, I like animals.
		Why don't ya give me ya number
		an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme
		getta pencil --

Rocky makes no motion to get a pencil.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Okay, what is it -- four-
		twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah,
		thanks for callin' -- Sure
		I'll get back to ya, Bruce --
		see ya.

Rocky hangs up.

				ADRIAN
		What was that you said about a
		pet shop?

				ROCKY
			(distant)
		... What?

				ADRIAN
		What did you say about a pet
		shop?

				ROCKY
		I don't want ya cleanin'
		nobody else's cages no more.

				ADRIAN
		Is everything all right?

				ROCKY
		I gotta go out for a while.

Rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; to dog)
		... Come.
 

									96.


INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - NIGHT

Rocky arrives at Goldmill's Gym... He unlocks the gym's door.
Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym.

Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the
steps to Mickey's office... At the top of the stairs he
looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters
the office.

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered
desk and sets up the projector... He goes to the cabinet and
removes a stack of 16 mm films.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

The office clock indicates it is several hours later.  Rocky
is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film.  He sits
motionless.

Rocky sits upright.  Something catches his eyes... He
springs at the projector.  He reruns the scene several times.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

Several hours later Rocky is engrossed in watching another
Apollo Creed film... He sits motionless.  Something catches
his eye.  Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering
a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent.

Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it
was a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing
on a note pad.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN

The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy
windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
has lost interest in watching the movies.

The film has completed its run through the projector and
lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
his reddened eyes.
 

									97.


The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
stare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies
Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
fighter's mind.

				MICKEY
		... I know what you're
		thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
		gotta shot -- All ya can do is
		try ya' best.

Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits
the room.  Mickey walks over and turns off the projector.
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it
slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.

EXT. STREET - DAWN

After leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly
move down the street and head for home.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Rocky arrives at his apartment... Adrian is asleep on the
couch.  He lowers himself beside her.  Her eyes open.

				ROCKY
		... Can't do it.

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		... I can't beat him.

				ADRIAN
		Apollo?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, I can't beat him.

Adrian touches his face.

				ROCKY
		I been watchin' the movies --
		studyin' -- He ain't weak
		nowhere.

				ADRIAN
		What're we going to do?

				ROCKY
		... I dunno.
 

									98.


				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.

				ROCKY
		It ain't so bad, 'cause I was
		a nothin' before --

				ADRIAN
		Don't say that.

				ROCKY
		C'mon, it's true -- But that
		don't bother me -- I just
		wanna prove somethin' -- I
		ain't no bum... It don't
		matter if I lose... Don't
		matter if he opens my head...
		The only thing I wanna do is
		go the distance -- That's all.
		Nobody's ever gone fifteen
		rounds with Creed.  If I go
		them fifteen rounds, an' that
		bell rings an' I'm still
		standin', I'm gonna know then
		I weren't just another bum
		from the neighborhood...

Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers
himself beside his woman.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... No foolin' around.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is
the Philadelphia Spectrum.

The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed
celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into
their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red,
white, and blue sweater...

The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and
blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE
WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN
FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent
except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the
arena.
 

									99.


It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING
SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room.
Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.

Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the
adhesive tape.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except
for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only
SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase
his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of
APOLLO TAKING IN AIR.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

A heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's
eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with
the grease.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Grease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME
CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into
the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and
lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from
the screen.
 

									100.


INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's trainer slips a mouthpiece into Apollo's mouth.
Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places
another one in the champ's mouth... Creed nods yes.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom.
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.  Completing his silent
prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
of his life.

Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
in and nods that it is time.  He leaves... Rocky steps out.

				MICKEY
		... It's time, kid.

Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.

				ADRIAN
		... I'll wait for you here.

Rocky nods and she kisses him.  The fighter leaves with his
trainers... Adrian is on the verge of tears.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rocky, Mickey and Mike start down the long hallway... Up
ahead are three security guards... Rocky rubs his bare
shoulders.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mick, can I have my rob?

Rocky puts on the robe... Embroidered across the back in
flaming letters is:

		"THE ITALIAN STALLION"

				*Pennzoil*

Mike helps him into the robe... Mickey is not amused.

				MICKEY
		Don't you care what the people
		will say?

				ROCKY
		... I'm doin' it for a friend.
 

									101.


				MICKEY
		Whatta you get outta this?

				ROCKY
		I get the robe an' Paulie gets
		three grand.

				MICKEY
		... Shrewd.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

TWO RINGSIDE COMMENTATORS sit in front of a panel of closed
circuit televisions.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		We would like to welcome our
		viewing audience to the Grand
		World Championship Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Fight -- the first
		major event of the Bicentennial
		Year... A point of interest is
		that the fight is being beamed
		to more than seven hundred and
		fifty million fans in theatres
		in nearly every corner of the
		world.  I would like to
		welcome an old friend, and co-
		commentator for this evening's
		event -- Jimmy Michaels.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Thank you, Bob.  The
		electricity is everywhere
		tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
		fifty-to-one underdog, is
		living a Cinderella story
		which has captured peoples'
		imaginations all over the
		world -- to quote a popular
		sports magazine, 'The fighting
		style should be 'The Caveman
		Against the Cavalier.' From
		the increase in sound it
		appears the challenger is now
		approaching the ring... His
		record is forty-four wins,
		twenty losses and thirty-eight
		knockouts.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I only wonder if this man has
		the skill to go past three
		rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
 

									102.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
insults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
the greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar
faces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
Washington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to
DEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and
Creed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington
outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
white and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,
white and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
silk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes
match the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
beard.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You could go deaf with the
		noise -- it undoubtedly means
		Champion Apollo Creed is
		heading towards the ring --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Am I seeing right?  Creed is
		approaching the ring in a boat.
		Is he supposed to be George
		Washington?  Obviously so.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		It's been confirmed that it is
		definitely an impersonation of
		George Washington -- a great
		way to start 1976 off.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I agree.

Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.

				APOLLO
		I want you!  I want you!

The crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to
his corner.

				MICKEY
		Don't let 'im get you tight.
 

									103.


				ROCKY
		Whatta ya think that outfit
		cost?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men
in suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely
and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky
waves at him.  Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at
his date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.

				ANNOUNCER
		Ladies and gentlemen --
		Welcome to the Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Championship
		Fight... We are very proud to
		have with us four former Great
		Champions... Ladies an' gents,
		'The one and only 'Manassa
		Mauler' -- Jack Dempsey!'

The CROWD ROARS and JACK DEMPSEY waves and goes to Creed's
corner, then Rocky's.

				DEMPSEY
		Good luck, kid.

He moves off.

				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Christ, Jack Dempsey.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer points and the timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

				ANNOUNCER
		Former Middleweight Champion --
		'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake
		LaMotta!

JAKE LA MOTTA raises his fist and gives best wishes to both
contenders... Timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		The man with the big punch --
		Everybody's favorite, 'The
		Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis!
 

									104.


JOE LOUIS bows and steps to Creed's corner.  Creed strikes a
boxing pose and Louis tosses a playful punch.
				ROCKY
		They must be friends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Now, last but certainly not
		least -- the former Heavyweight
		Champion, a son of Philly,
		Smoking Joe Frazier!

FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS.
Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's
going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They
laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner.

				FRAZIER
		Save some of him for me.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The former champ looks great --
		Can we get Joe over here --
		here he comes.

Joe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(continuing)
		Joe, what are your feelings
		about tonight's fight?

				FRAZIER
		Well, I think any man who
		works an' trains hard always
		gotta chance.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You look in great shape, Joe.

				FRAZIER
		I'm always in shape.

Joe laughs and exits.  The timekeeper RINGS the BELL.
 

									105.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		... Now for the evening's main
		event -- In the corner to my
		right, The Challenger, wearing
		white trunks -- At one hundred
		an' ninety-one pounds, one of
		Philly's own sons -- 'The
		Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa!

A good CROWD RESPONSE.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		In the far corner, wearing
		red, white an' blue -- Weighing
		in at two hundred and ten
		pounds -- Undefeated in forty-
		six fights -- the Heavyweight
		Champion of the World -- 'The
		Master of Disaster' -- Apollo
		Creed!

The arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the
center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules
Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The
Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the
screen... Something soulful and frightening is being
communicated.

				REFEREE
		... Now come out fighting.

The fighters return to their corners.

				MICKEY
		God bless ya, Rock.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as
though he considers the man an amateur.
 

									106.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The Champ stings the slower
		challenger with jabs at
		will -- Balboa blocks eighty
		percent of the blows with his
		face -- Creed doesn't look the
		best he's ever been but is
		moving smoothly -- Creed snaps
		out a triple combination that
		backs Balboa into a corner --
		oh, a solid hook by Creed, a
		master of fist-men.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		The Champion is smiling and
		toying with the man -- trying
		to give the fans their money's
		worth and make a show of it
		with the badly out-classes
		challenger -- Another left to
		right combination.  I feel
		sorry for --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Creed is down!!!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw.
Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show
disbelief.  So do Rocky's.

Rocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him.

				MICKEY
		You can do it!  Goddamnit, you
		got the power!  The body, get
		the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!

				REFEREE
		Six!... Seven!... Eight!...

Creed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all
business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly.

				APOLLO
		... Come at me, sucker!

Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's
chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed
to cringe...
 

									107.


Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations
to the body.

The BELL RINGS.

ROCKY'S CORNER

				ROCKY
		How am I doin'?

				MICKEY
		Real good.

				ROCKY
		See how fast he is -- damn!

				MICKEY
		Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin
		down!!  Use the legs and drive
		through 'im.  Attack --
		Attack -- Attack!

APOLLO'S CORNER

Apollo does not sit.  He stands and clowns with the
spectators to prove he is not hurt.

				APOLLO
			(to Trainer)
		... That boy damn near broke
		my arm.

				TRAINER
		Sure -- He can hit -- Don't
		play no more -- Stick an'
		move, hear?

				APOLLO
		I'll carry him 'till the third.

				TRAINER
		Don't play with this man, he's
		fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel
		some real heat!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast
and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that
dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs
his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.
 

									108.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding
combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that
flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The
round ends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he
is beginning to show the strain from the body punches.

				APOLLO
		Man, I rearranged his face
		with that right -- The people
		love what's happenin' tonight.

				TRAINER
		People nothin', you in a
		fight, my man, -- ya best
		believe what you hear... Knock
		that boy out soon an' let's go
		home.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling
around his eyes... The nose is shattered.

				MICKEY
		Ya nose is broke.

				ROCKY
		Damn!  How's it look?

				MICKEY
		Can't hardly tell.  Don't
		swallow the blood -- Go for
		his ribs.  Don't let 'im
		breathe.

				ROCKY
		... The guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Why don't ya tell 'im you're a
		fan!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators are caught up in the action.  They speak
rapidly into their microphones.
 

									109.


				COMMENTATOR #2
		If you had asked anyone who
		knows boxing, they never
		would've predicted a first
		round knockdown and the second
		round punishment to the body
		of the Champion... Most
		fighters will tell you,
		receiving a good body punch is
		the next worst thing to dying.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Round three ready to start and
		should be interesting to see
		if Creed can put the challenger
		away -- there goes the bell.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Round three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side-
steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general,
Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and
Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling...
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to
the heart.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Apollo almost sprints out of
		his corner -- feints and
		throws a pair of left-right
		combinations.  Balboa drops
		beneath a left upper cut and
		lands a very solid shot on
		Creed's temple -- not much
		movement from Balboa, duck a
		left, a right, another left
		and explodes with a right hook
		to the temple -- I mean
		explodes.  The Champ backs off.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		There's no way Apollo expected
		this kind of hitting power.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		No way -- but the brilliant
		ability of the Champion to
		master situations like this is
		one of his most outstanding
		traits -- Creed tosses a
		perfect right hand that rocks
		Rocky.
				(MORE)
 

									110.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		Creed on the offensive --
		Balboa takes the punishment
		and counters with a left flush
		over the heart... that hurt.

The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A
STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a
terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.
Creed's face contorts with excruciation.

				TRAINER
			(yelling)
		Cover your face!  Cover up!
			(to Assistant)
		My man's cut, my man's
		bleedin' -- Get ready!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close
the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut.

				TRAINER
		Bad?  Talk to me, man!

				DOCTOR
		Deep, but passable.

				APOLLO
			(staring at Rocky)
		... That man's takin' his job
		too serious.

				TRAINER
		He's movin' to your left --
		don't let him no more -- dance
		and stick, hear?  Don't
		play -- I know what ya feelin',
		but don't play.

				APOLLO
		He got lucky.

				TRAINER
		Luck!  You fightin' a crazy
		man -- but you got him hurt
		bad.
			(to Assistant)
		More ice, now!
 

									111.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly
swollen around the eyes.

				MICKEY
		How you holdin' up, kid?

				ROCKY
		Fine... That guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Gimme the water!  Ya getttin'
		tagged with his right.  I
		think you should feint left
		and high hook 'im -- Benny,
		check the eyes!  Can ya see?

				ROCKY
			(standing)
		See what?

				MIKE
		Ya sappin' his strength --
		He's losin' steam.

				ROCKY
		He ain't losin' nothin'.

				MICKEY
		Keep on him -- You're doin'
		great.

SERIES OF SHOTS

In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to
ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut.
Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Adrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the
GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.

INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT

Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door
at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE
OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back
to watching the fight.
 

									112.


INT. ARENA - NIGHT

Adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the
battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.

Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a
thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...
Rocky is game but losing.

At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
his seat.

Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.
Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the
bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and
cheer loudly.

				ANDY
		... The Rock's got real stones.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

The men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips
and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
outclassed.

				APOLLO
		C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He
sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound
and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But
Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators shift in their seats.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Without a doubt this is the
		most punishing brawl I have
		ever seen -- The ringside
		audience is spotted with blood.
				(MORE)
 

									113.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		This fight should have been
		stopped rounds ago but Rocky
		Balboa refuses to fall --

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Not only has he refused to
		fall, but he has beaten the
		Champion's body without mercy
		and the bout has become a
		vicious slugfest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely
hurt.

				APOLLO
		My side.

				TRAINER
			(to Assistant)
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		No doctor!

				TRAINER
		You're hurtin', man!

				APOLLO
		No doctor!... I'm feelin'
		good, bro!

ANOTHER ANGLE

In Rocky's corner, things are frantic.  His eyes are swollen
shut.

				MICKEY
		Wanna keep goin'?

				ROCKY
		Would you keep goin'?

				MICKEY
		... Yeah.

				MIKE
		No more, ya wanna lose an eye?
		No more.
 

									114.


				ROCKY
		Open my eyes -- Please, open
		my eyes!

Mickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife
between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement
he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
one is ever aware of the operation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
She is caught up in the heat of the battle.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,
but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined
to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and
receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to
ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
to stay down.

				REFEREE
		Six -- Seven -- Eight --

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He
is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into
Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like
a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he
leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
judges and continues to fight.
 

									115.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
corner.

				APOLLO
		... Ribs broke --

Blood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.  The
Trainer feels the ribs.

				TRAINER
		Yo' bleedin' inside, man --
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		One more round.

				TRAINER
		Don't kill yourself, man --
		Let the doctor stop the fight.

				APOLLO
		... Stop jivin'!

				TRAINER
		Cover the ribs -- Look here,
		elbow down, tight -- Tight --
		stand straight -- you're the
		best, you're the best!

				APOLLO
		... Thanks.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely
been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant.

				ROCKY
		How I look out there, Mick?

				MICKEY
			(truly worried)
		Great, kid, great.

The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.

				DOCTOR
		One more round -- How do you
		feel?

Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He
cannot be bothered with pain or doctors.
 

									116.


				ROCKY
		Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna
		make it -- I'm gonna make it!

Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition.

				MICKEY
		We gotta stop it, kid.

				MIKE
		Ya gave it ya best shot!

				MICKEY
		Nobody's gonna say ya didn't
		give ya all.  I can't let ya
		go out.

Rocky stands and eyes them all.

				ROCKY
			(impassioned
			and quietly)
		I'll kill ya all... Don't stop
		nothin' --

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner
and circles to Rocky's right.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The fight has slowed down to a
		near stand-still -- Creed
		circles to Rocky's right...
		The spectrum is nearly
		silent -- Neither fighter has
		made a motion to throw... I've
		never seen anything like it in
		the last round of a
		championship fight... Apollo
		spits blood on the canvas.  It
		appears he is protecting his
		right side.  His ribs were
		probably injured at the end of
		round fourteen.
				(MORE)
 

									117.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		It's confirmed, unofficially,
		Creed's ribs may be broken --
		Apollo fakes a left and throws
		a big tired right -- Balboa's
		mouthpiece is out!  Creed
		attacks with one hand!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes
a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
their feet.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.
written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for
blow.

				ROCKY
		Gimme ya best!!!!

Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Gimme ya best!!!

Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.

The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit
of strength from their souls and beat each other without
mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension
far beyond blood and pain.

				SIX
				FIVE
				FOUR
				THREE
				TWO
				ONE!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval.
 

									118.


Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the
midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.

As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
ear.

				APOLLO
		... Ain't gonna be no rematch.

				ROCKY
		... Don't want one.

Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to
his corner... Mickey embraces him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer enters the ring with a microphone.

				ANNOUNCER
		Attention, please!!  Attention!!
		Ladies and gentlemen, tonight
		we have had the rare privilege
		to have witnessed the greatest
		exhibitions of stamina and
		guts ever in the history of
		sports.

The CROWD ROARS.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		Ladies and gentlemen -- We
		have a split decision!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo did not expect this and tenses.  His corner nervously
tries to reassure him.  It does no good.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at
Mickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Walker scores it eight-
		seven Creed... Judge Roseman
		scores it eight-seven Balboa.
 

									119.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo is rigid.  Fear radiates from his eyes.  To lose the
crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill
him... A silence has blanketed the arena.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Conners scores it nine-
		six Creed... Winner and still
		Heavyweight Champion of the
		World, Apollo Creed!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of CHEERING fans
that circle the ring and reach out towards him... Mickey
grabs Rocky's hand and raises it.  The CROWD ROARS.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what they say,
		you're a winner.

				ROCKY
		Yo, can I have my locker back?

Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs
Rocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky
turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
shoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the
ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
reflect admiration.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-
wishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting
apprehension as the fans become abnormally active.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.
Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but
they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
along by a legion of fans.
 

									120.


ANOTHER ANGLE

On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
frightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to
control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
clamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
their shoulders.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against
each other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'

Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'

ANOTHER ANGLE

Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he
starts swinging.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the
crowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless
as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...
The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
forward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
through the mass to get to Rocky.

ANOTHER ANGLE

She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
but she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,
Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
and waits for the procession to pass.

The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be
king of the world.

The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on
her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams
Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
the racket and reaches Rocky.

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is
carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the
crowd won't permit it.
 

									121.


Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a
down escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky
manages to crawl across them to Adrian.

Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up
and they lock in an embrace.

				ADRIAN
		I love you -- I love you -- I
		love you...

The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can
remember...

				THE END
RUSH

1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1

    Dark clouds passing overhead.

    The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in
    Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..


2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2

    A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
    Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..


3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3

    The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
    international TV commentators in different languages.

                         COMMENTATORS
               ...in places the track is still
               dangerously wet, but following a
               drivers meeting the decision has been
               taken. The race is going ahead...


4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4

    The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
    wearing a fireproof balaclava...

    Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

                         NIKI (V/O)
               My grandfather always said history is
               cruel and reductive and no matter how
               long we live, or how much we achieve -
               we are remembered for very little. So
               make sure it's the right things.

    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
    using slicks or wets?


5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5

    We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major
    Grand Prix. All around us...




                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                         2
5   CONTINUED:                                                       5


    Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
    Minute"...

    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.

                           NIKI
                 This is bullshit. We have no control
                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what
                 we are remembered for...

    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

                           MECHANIC
                 Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
                 anche tu?
                     (Mass is going on slicks. You
                      want to change?)

    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

                           NIKI
                 Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the
                 1976 season.

    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

                           NIKI
                 What about Hunt? Has he changed?

                           MECHANIC
                 No, he's going on wets.

    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

                           NIKI
                 I don't know why it became such a big
                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting
                 each other's balls. To me this is
                 perfectly normal. But other people saw
                 it differently.

                                                           (CONTINUED)
                                                                         3
5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   5

                         NIKI (contíd)
               That whatever it was between us went
               deeper. And changed us both somehow.
               Forever.

    NIKI stares, then...

                         NIKI
               Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da
               bagnato.
                   (Then we go on wets, too.)

    The ten-second board is held up.

    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
    split-second, eyes staring...

    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
    RPM.

                         NIKI
               Maybe that explains the state of mind
               I was in. And why it happened. The
               other thing I'm remembered for.
                   (a beat)
               On August 1st, that same year...

    CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".

    The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his
    engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch
    scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.

    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
    leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

    His arch-rival. HUNT.

    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
    change tyres...

    NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
    one end...
                                                                          4



6   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6

    Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
    crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
    pits to change to dry tyres.

    It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

    The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
    men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
    Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..

                         MECHANIC
               Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le
               slicks!
                   (See? I told you to go on
                    slicks!!)

                         NIKI
               Bullshit. Where's Hunt?

                            MECHANIC
               There!

    NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black
    helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...

                            NIKI
               C'mon...!!

    NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns
    make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.

                         NIKI
               What's GOING ON???

    "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and
    NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost
    him dear...


7   EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                             7

    Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS
    stations informs us of the positions.

    MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...


8   INT. NIKI'S CAR - DAY                                             8

    NIKI gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
    trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine
    screaming.

    He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
    Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
    now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.

    NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
    wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
    any harder.

    NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
    the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
    And tight. Too tight. A mistake...

    "Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
    inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
    mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

    "Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,
    and is thrown across the track..

    Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
    with another car bearing down upon him...

                          NIKI
                 No...!

    The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a
    sickening, terrifying impact.

    The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
    gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
    seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.

    NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
    temperature. Trapped inside his car.

    Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

    Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
    commentators helplessly describe what's happening..

    NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
    figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

    Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
    to undo NIKI's seatbelt..

    Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
    Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out
    in agony, inhaling the powder..

    Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,
    the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

    Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

    Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...


9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9

    We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular
    Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

    Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-
    feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.

                         NURSE
               Emergency...

    She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is
    being said. Then her expression changes...

                         NURSE
               Okay...standing by!

    The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR
    colleagues...

                         NURSE
               That was the race-track..! There's
               been an accident..! A driver's been
               injured and is on his way in..!

    Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as
    DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...

    All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.

    The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
    consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...

    CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"

    Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks
    through and into the accident and emergency unit.

    Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
    overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
    (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

    A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
    describe an Englishman. SEXY.

    Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and
    the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no
    mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..

                  I think the racetrack telephoned ahead
                  that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..?

     JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..

                            JAMES
                  What's the matter? No one seen a spot
                  of blood before?

                            NURSE
                  Are you all right?

                            JAMES
                  Absolutely fine.


10   INT. A&E UNIT - DAY                                              10

     The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls,
     checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...

                            NURSE
                  We all thought you'd been in an
                  accident.

                            JAMES
                  I have. If you call a friendly
                  disagreement with another driver an
                  accident.

                            NURSE
                  What did you disagree about?

                            JAMES
                  None of your business. Ouch.

                              NURSE
                  Sorry.

                              JAMES
                  His wife.

                            NURSE
                  That's going to need a couple of
                  stitches. It's a nasty cut.

                            JAMES
                  It was a nasty blow. Done with a
                  bloody spanner.

                            NURSE
                  Why? What did you do?

                  Nothing! Only what she begged me to
                  do.

     The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES's chest...

                            NURSE
                  Which was..?

     She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest..

     JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet..

                            JAMES
                  Be happy to show you if you like.


11   INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  11

     `Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble
     through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...

     The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor
     student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer
     cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two
     budgerigars.

     A mattress on the floor.

     Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
     crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
     government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,
     leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

     JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
     dressed, but already passionately making love...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  I have a theory why women like racing
                  drivers. It's not because they respect
                  what we do...driving round and round
                  in circles. Mostly they think that's
                  pathetic. And they're probably right..
                      (a beat)
                  It's our closeness to death.

     JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love
     in the shower...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  The closer you are to death, the more
                  alive you FEEL...the more alive you
                  ARE. And they can see that in you.
                  FEEL that in you. The way you live.
                  Willing to risk everything.

                            JAMES (V/O) (contíd)
                  With no thought for tomorrow...as if
                  each day is your last. It's a
                  wonderful way to live...and the ONLY
                  way to drive. The only way to get that
                  tenth of a second on everyone else...

     The lovemaking becomes more intense...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  To dare to be one step bolder...one
                  step faster...

     JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  Sure one step closer to death...

     JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  But one step closer to victory, too...

     JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the
     bed. Exhausted.


12   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - DAY                             12

     A grotty old race track in South London.

     JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his
     battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the
     mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..

                            NURSE
                  I've never been to a Grand Prix
                  before.

                            JAMES
                  You still haven't. This is Formula 3.

                            NURSE
                  What's that?

                            JAMES
                  A lower division. Where people like me
                  mess about in the hope of finding
                  sponsors or being talent-spotted to
                  race in Formula 1.

     JAMES leads the NURSE into...
                                                                           10



13   THE PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                               13

     The pits where JAMES introduces her to his team...

                          JAMES
                Everyone, this is Nursie.

                          NURSIE
                    (correcting)
                Gemma...

                          JAMES
                Nursie, this is Doc our designer...

                          DOC
                How do you do?

                          JAMES
                Bubbles, our chief mechanic.

                          BUBBLES
                How do you do?

                          JAMES
                Le Patron - Alexander, Lord Hesketh.

                          HESKETH
                How do you do?

                          NURSE
                Fine, thanks. Blimey...is everyone in
                Formula 3 this posh?

                          HESKETH
                Glass of champagne, Nursie?

                          NURSE
                It's Gemma. No, thanks.

                          HESKETH
                You sure? It's Krug. Clos de Mesnil.

                          NURSE
                It's also ten in the morning.

                          HESKETH
                Oh, dear. Superstar? You haven't
                brought us a bore, have you?

     JAMES strips off, changing into his racing overalls.

                          JAMES
                Trust me. Nursie's anything BUT a
                bore..

     The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where
     BUBBLES is making last minute checks...

                            NURSE
                  That's the car?

                            BUBBLES
                  That's her. The Dastle Mk 9...with the
                  Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.
                  She's no beauty. But goes like the
                  clappers.

     An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with
     yellow strips along the side and James's name in small
     letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.

                            JAMES
                  Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.

     The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound.
     She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...

                            HESKETH
                  Nothing to be worried about! Does it
                  before every race! Good sign,
                  actually. Means he's stoked!


14   EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                         14

     JAMES continues vomiting...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  There's a lie that all drivers tell
                  themselves. "Death is something that
                  happens to other people." That's how
                  you find the courage to get in the car
                  in the first place...

     JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...

                            HESKETH
                  All right, Superstar?

                            JAMES
                  Never better, Patron.

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  Because bad things only happen to
                  others, right?

                            HESKETH
                  Have a gargle with this.

     JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then
     swallows, puts on his balaclava...

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  Problem is deep down you know that's a
                  lie. That it could happen to you at
                  any moment.

                            HESKETH
                  Quick toke of this...

     HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a
     huge lungful from....

                            JAMES (V/O)
                  So how do you make that terror go
                  away? Well, booze is good for that.
                  And wacky baccy. But better than
                  everything else is...sex.

     JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips,
     then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car.

     JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM
     as the engine starts...

                            HESKETH
                  Ahhhh! What music! They could never
                  have predicted it, those pioneers that
                  invented the automobile that it would
                  possess us like this, in our
                  imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men
                  love women...but even more than that,
                  men love CARS...


15   EXT. PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                              15

     JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already
     unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..

                            JAMES
                  Who's that?

                  Is there a difference?

     JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in
     the form of a signature, "Niki Lauda".

                            JAMES
                  All bloody Goosesteppers.


16   EXT. RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY                           16

     JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner.

     NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second
     bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No
     right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.

     Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..

     JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to
     slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...


17   EXT. PITS - SAME TIME                                            17

     sidelines...

                            BUBBLES
                  That move was suicide!

                  It was also quite brilliant!! God he's

     JAMES carries on driving. Flat out.

     But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his
     car has 50 bhp more.

     And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the
     Englishman beaten..

     JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful
     madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...

     ...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI's
     car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.

     NIKI and JAMES's cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal
     spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right

     ...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to
     change gears, and continue driving...

     NIKI's car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing
     THE WRONG WAY on the track...

     NIKI's eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow,
     like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...

                            NIKI
                  Umgotteswillen...

     NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car,
     when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.

     NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....

     "SMASH", one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it
     would have killed him instantly).

     "WHAM", another car narrowly misses him...

     "CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...

     Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...

     NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.
     He rips off his helmet, furious...

     And now we see NIKI LAUDA's face for the first time. Sharp-
     featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth.

     Something unmistakably rat-like about him.


19   EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON                 19

     JAMES is on the podium, having won. He's with the NURSE, and
     HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with
     champagne..

     NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and
     shouts out, still incandescent...

                            NIKI
                  Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had
                  that corner...

                            JAMES
                  You mean the one you spun out of? And
                  finished facing the other way? I think
                  that corner had you.

     Laughter.

                            NIKI
                  That move was total suicide. What if I
                  hadn't braked? We'd have crashed..!!

                            JAMES
                  But we didn't, did we? Thanks to your
                  impeccable `survival' instincts...

     JAMES makes chicken noises...

                            NIKI
                  Fuck you! What's your name?

                            HESKETH
                  James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it,
                  my little Jerry friend. Because one
                  day he will be World Champion.

                            JAMES
                  Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple.
                  "Hunt". It rhymes with....

     "BEEEEP", a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES's c-word
     insult...

                             JAMES
                  ...a word that happens to describe you
                  perfectly.

     Laughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, "Screw you, asshole".
     The NURSE watches NIKI go..

                            NURSE
                  Who was that?

                            JAMES
                  No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad
                  loser. Forget him.

     NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..


20   EXT. VIENNA SKYLINE - DAY                                        20

     To establish: the Austrian capital. OVER THIS: the sound of
     NIKI's voice...

                            NIKI (V/O)
                  In my home town, Vienna, my family is
                  famous for one thing. Business. My
                  grandfather was a businessman, my
                  father, too...
                                                                           16



21   INT. NIKI'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      21

     NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket,
     and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...

                          NIKI (V/O)
                So when they heard I wanted to race
                cars for a living, they had a few
                things to say...


22   INT. LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT                             22

     A large, forbidding dining room. NIKI's FATHER and terrifying
     GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head,
     clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)

                          GRANDFATHER
                Never! Racing is for playboys and
                dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with
                nothing in their heads. The name
                `Lauda' appears on the front pages,
                with politicians and economists, not
                on the back pages with...
                    (gestures in contempt)
                ...footballers and skiers. If you want
                my money, you do as I say and follow
                me into my business..

     NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..

                          NIKI (V/O)
                It's in moments like this that you
                discover who you really are..

     ...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for
     ever, NIKI gets to his feet..

                          NIKI
                Fine. Keep your money. Don't invest in
                me. But when I'm World Champion, and I
                have the trophy, and my name is not
                just on the back pages, but on the
                front too, you will regret it.

     NIKI walks out, the old man's insults ringing in his ears...

                          GRANDFATHER
                You dare sit at my table and lecture
                me on what I will or won't regret? Get
                out! Impertinent wretch! Consider
                yourself disowned!
                                                                          17



23   INT. RAIFEISENKASSE - BANK - DAY                                23

     NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and
     LAWYERS. They speak in German...

                          BANKER
                Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still
                haven't repaid the other...

                          BANKER 2
                Three..

                          BANKER
                Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus
                your Grandfather called to inform us
                he will no longer be offering
                security.

                          NIKI
                I know. There is no room for failure.
                I understand that.

                          NIKI (V/O)
                But I was still a Lauda...


24   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                   24

     NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on
     his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading
     "Flughafen". (Airport)...

                          NIKI (V/O)
                ...which meant I was still a
                businessman above everything else.


25   EXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY                                       25

     A private jet. A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle-
     age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the
     tarmac...

                          NIKI (V/O)
                It just so happens that the business I
                deal in is speed.


26   INT. VIENNA AIRPORT - CAFE                                      26

     NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe.

     Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS
     STANLEY is counter-signing...

26   CONTINUED:                                                     26


                            STANLEY
                  In return for your money you get a
                  car, mechanics and a place on the
                  team. Plus fifty per cent of starting
                  fees and bonuses for podium finishes.

                            NIKI
                  Who's the number one driver?

                            STANLEY
                  Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to
                  him at all times.

     NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up...

                            NIKI
                  Why would I defer to him if I am
                  paying his wages?

     NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades..

                            STANLEY
                  Because he's a proven winner at the
                  highest level, a good guy, and someone
                  who quite frankly, could teach you a
                  thing or two.

     NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...

                            NIKI
                  OK. There is one clause missing.

                            STANLEY
                  The one about mechanics' exclusivity?
                  Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.
                  All information is shared between ALL
                  our drivers..

                            NIKI
                  And I made it perfectly clear that my
                  mechanics work for me. No one else.
                  This is something I cannot sign.

     NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares...

                            STANLEY
                  All right. I'll have the lawyers amend
                  it.

                            NIKI
                  While you're at it you can tell them
                  to amend the clause for podium
                  finishes. Podium is first THREE
                  places, not just wins.

     NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut,
     taking it with him..

                          NIKI
                You'll get the money on signature, as
                agreed. See you at winter testing.

     NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache
     case disappear.

                          STANLEY
                If that little git drives half as well
                as he negotiates, we're going to be
                fine.

28   INT. AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT                                      28

     An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with
     cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black
     tie...

                          PRESENTER
                I'm delighted to say the winner of the
                British Guild of Motoring Writers
                award for the `Most Promising Driver
                of the Year' is James Hunt...

     A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table.

     JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives
     her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet,
     shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the
     podium...

                          JAMES
                Thank you. My parents always wanted me
                to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and
                gave me a first class education...but
                to no avail. My brothers are the
                success stories. I get bored easily. I
                have a hot head, an inability to
                tolerate discipline. I fall out with
                people left and right. I'm quick to
                settle matters with my fists. The only
                creatures I've ever loved and treated
                well, are budgerigars. In any normal
                area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total
                liability. All I've got going for me
                is I'm quick in a car.

                            WOMAN
                  That's not all!

     Laughter.

                            JAMES
                  So thank you for acknowledging that.
                  And giving me this...
                      (indicating trophy)
                  I'm going to give it to my Dad, and
                  tell him to put it on the mantle-piece
                  and imagine it's a first class degree
                  in medicine.


29   INT. AWARDS CEREMONY - LATER                                    29

     Afterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every
     pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched
     beside bottles of champagne...

                            HESKETH
                  Well done, Superstar. One more season
                  in F2 then I'll move you up. To the
                  big time.

                            JAMES
                  You don't think I'm ready now?

                            HESKETH
                  You are! I'm not! I've got to find you
                  a car first. And the money. The
                  economics of Formula 1 are terrifying.

                            BUBBLES
                  Hurry up. You don't want him to do
                  what Lauda did.

     `Pop', HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...

                            BUBBLES (contíd)
                  The Goosestepper. Remember him?

     JAMES makes the chicken noises again..

                            BUBBLES
                  Said he no longer wanted to risk his
                  life with "a bunch of crazy amateurs
                  and losers..."

                            JAMES
                  Is that what he called us?

                  Said if he was going to risk his life,
                  he would only do so on the big
                  roulette table. Formula 1. So he got
                  himself a drive with BRM.

                  A hundred and fifty grand?

     JAMES stares. Already sick with envy.

                            JAMES
                  That's either an act of utter lunacy,
                  or the ballsiest thing I ever heard.

30   INT/EXT. RECEPTION PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - FRANCE - DAY           30

     The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of
     France. Where all winter training and testing is done.

     NIKI arrives. An attractive woman (AGNES) greets him...

                            NIKI
                  Niki Lauda. Here for pre-season
                  testing. BRM?

                            AGNES
                  Take a seat, please. I'll get someone
                  to come and collect you...

     NIKI watches as she telephones the BRM workshops...

                            AGNES
                  Hi. There's someone here for you?

                            NIKI
                      (prompting)
                  Lauda.

                            AGNES
                      (misunderstanding, speaking
                       louder)
                  SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.

     She hangs up. NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.

                            AGNES
                  They'll be right here.

                               NIKI
                  Thank you.

     A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI
     watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...

                            NIKI
                  Worked here long?

                               AGNES
                  Excuse me?

                            NIKI
                  Just wondered if you've worked here
                  long?

                            AGNES
                  Almost eight years.

                            NIKI
                  That long? And they didn't promote you
                  yet?

                            AGNES
                  Yes, several times. I am the AGNES.
                  Agnes Bonnet. If you're looking for
                  the receptionist, she's on her lunch.

     NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to
     say something when the door opens, and...

     Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..



                                                           (CONTINUED)
                                                                           23

     Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,
     they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

     What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.
     What have you done to the weather?

     They make her laugh. And smile.

     NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He
     gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect
     him.

     As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the
     other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

     He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.


31   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                         31

     The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the
     car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...

                          STANLEY
                Niki, let me introduce you to our
                number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and
                our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..

     The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY
     REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands.

                          STANLEY
                And these are your mechanics,
                reporting exclusively to you. As per
                contract...

     REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes
     hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS.

                          MECHANIC
                You want to see the car?


32   INT/EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY                                     32

     NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro
     sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just
     above the driver's helmet...

                          MECHANIC
                There she is. The P160..

                          NIKI
                Same as Regazzoni's?

32   CONTINUED:                                                     32


                            MECHANIC
                  Identical in every detail.

     NIKI scrutinizes the car...

                            NIKI
                  She looks heavy. How much does she
                  weigh?

                               MECHANIC
                  540 kilos.

                            NIKI
                  That's crazy. Why so heavy..?

                            MECHANIC
                  It's a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing
                  weighs 190k alone.

                            NIKI
                  What horsepower are you getting out of
                  it?

                               MECHANIC
                  450.

                            NIKI
                  Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the
                  engine needs to be 20k lighter.

                            MECHANIC
                  We already tried...

                            NIKI
                  Did you use magnesium parts?

     The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...


33   INT. BRM WORKSHOPS - NIGHT                                      33

     Shooting from above:

     The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now
     spread all over the workshop floor.

     NIKI's team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night
     making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...

                            NIKI
                  Any solid plate, strip it out...

     More disbelieving, skeptical looks. The car is in pieces on
     the floor. NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert. Focused.

33   CONTINUED:                                                    33


                            NIKI
                  And when we've done that, we need to
                  look at the aerodynamics. Front and
                  rear wing..

     More mutinous looks. "Who is this asshole?"


34   EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - FIRST LIGHT                                 34

     Daylight breaks over the race-track. The doors to the workshop
     open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.

     NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...

                            NIKI
                  OK. Thank you. Good night..

     But they're exhausted. Refuse to shake hands with this nut.


35   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   35

     LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...

     NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time-
     testing his car. He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and
     several MECHANICS are doing the timings...

                            NIKI
                  What was his time?

                            STANLEY
                  Two minutes six seconds.

                            NIKI
                  OK. Now put him in my car, and he'll
                  go round under two minutes.

                            STANLEY
                  Six seconds faster? Impossible.

     NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again
     on the other side of the track.

     NIKI waves hi. AGNES waves back. Smiles. NIKI raises his
     eyebrow. Surprised.


36   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   36

     REGAZZONI gets into NIKI's car.
                                                                         26



37   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 37

     REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.

     REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI's car. LOUIS
     STANLEY looks at the stop watch..

     His expression changes.


38   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                 38

     STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS
     are in conversation, getting changed...

                          STANLEY
                All right. What did you do to the car?

                          NIKI
                That's information I will share with
                you under certain conditions only.

     STANLEY stares, bracing himself..

                           STANLEY
                Go on...

                          NIKI
                A guaranteed place in the team, and a
                paid contract on equal terms with
                Regazzoni for two years.

                          STANLEY
                Are you crazy? Clay's a senior figure
                in Formula One...you're a rookie. The
                only reason we took you ON was because
                you were paying us.

                          NIKI
                Well, as of now, if you want me to
                stay, we rip up the contract. I don't
                pay you a cent.

                          STANLEY
                It's outrageous.

                           NIKI
                Was he quicker in my car? He was,
                wasn't he?

     STANLEY stares...

                          NIKI
                Did he go under two minutes?

                      (quiet)
                  One fifty-six.

                            NIKI
                  So have a think, work out your
                  priorities, and get back to me.

     NIKI turns, and goes. STANLEY stares...

                            STANLEY
                  Not even my WIFE speaks to me like
                  that.


39   EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY                                   39

     CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by
     the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe.

     He removes his helmet, then stops.

     In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive
     TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off..


40   INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY         40

     NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with
     AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...

     CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks
     English with an Italian accent..

                            REGAZZONI
                  I know what you're going to say. That
                  it's none of my business...

                            NIKI
                  What?

                            REGAZZONI
                  If it's the Track Manager you're
                  taking on your date tonight?

     NIKI immediately becomes defensive...

                            NIKI
                  It's none of your business.

                            REGAZZONI
                  Okay, but if you want my advice...I'd
                  let this one go. I'm not questioning
                  your taste. She's a great girl.

                  British Formula 2 driver, who has a
                  reputation for two things. For being a
                  suicidal jerk on the track, and for
                  going all night, and all day
                  afterwards...and all night again in
                  bed. He's an OK driver, but an
                  IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't
                  know about you, but that's not an act
                  I'd like to follow.
                      (shrugs)
                  But if that doesn't bother you...

                            NIKI
                  What's his name? The driver?

                            REGAZZONI
                  Hunt. James Hunt.

     NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it.

                            REGAZZONI
                  See? You share information, I share
                  information.

     CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..

                            REGAZZONI
                  That's what team-mates are for.

                            NIKI
                      (quiet/defeated)
                  Thanks.


41   EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                          41

     A restaurant in Marseilles. Through the window we can see
     AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER sitting at a table alone.
     Waiting for NIKI.

     Reverse angle to reveal:


42   INT. NIKI'S CAR/ MARSEILLES STREET - SAME TIME                   42

     NIKI is sitting in a car across the street. He stares at AGNES
     in the restaurant. Then starts his car, and drives off.

43   EXT. EASTON NESTON - HESKETH RACING HQ - DAY                     43

     Easton Neston. Set in 3,300 acres, one of England's great
     country houses. Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700.

     JAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his
     anything but grandiose Mini. It splutters to a stop, just in
     time.

     They are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags
     from his filthy car.


44   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY              44

     The Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted
     stables on the estate. HESKETH leads a blindfolded JAMES in...

                          HESKETH
                Keep them closed...! Wait for it, wait
                for it...

     HESKETH removes JAMES's blindfold...

                          HESKETH
                There! What do you say?

     JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain
     white, no stickers...

                          HESKETH
                Isn't she a beauty? The March 731.
                Converted by the brilliant Doc..!

     DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with
     everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..

                          JAMES
                She is a beauty. But...haven't you
                made a mistake?

                          HESKETH
                What?

                          JAMES
                That's not a Formula 2 car. She's F1.

                          HESKETH
                She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got
                together with the beancounters, and it
                turns out that the economics of F1 are
                not so significantly different to the
                economics of Formula 2...

     BUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue..

                            HESKETH
                  So we thought if we were going to be
                  messing about losing money we might as
                  well be doing it with the big boys.

                            JAMES
                  Are you serious?

                            HESKETH
                  Never been more serious in my life!

     JAMES embraces HESKETH in excitement, kisses him...

                            HESKETH
                  Actually, I got the idea after what
                  you said about the Austrian chap who
                  bought his way in rather than waste
                  his time in the lower divisions. I
                  thought, "Bloody hell, he's right!"

     JAMES slips into the cockpit...

                            JAMES
                  Well done the Goosestepper!!

                            HESKETH
                      (indicates car)
                  No sponsorship, Superstar! I hope you
                  approve.

                            JAMES
                  I do, Patron.

                            HESKETH
                  No vulgar logos for cigarettes, or
                  condoms. Just plain white. With the
                  Union Jack. And racing overalls which
                  read...

     HESKETH indicates JAMES's hanging racing overalls...

                            HESKETH
                  "Sex. Breakfast of Champions." Unless
                  it's me, of course, in which case it's
                  two kippers, porridge, boiled eggs,
                  and half a dozen slices of toast...

     Laughter.

                            JAMES
                  So when do we start?

                            HESKETH
                  Soon as you're ready.

                That's my boy!

     HESKETH pops champagne...

                          HESKETH
                They won't know what's hit them!


45   EXT. SPANISH GP - RACE TRACK -27 APRIL 1975- DAY                 45

     To establish: a Formula 1 race track on Grand Prix week-end..

     A helicopter comes in to land.

     The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue
     of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS' ROYCE's, oysters, champagne...

     A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss)
     providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh's debut...

                          STIRLING MOSS
                ...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh
                and his team of upper class
                enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the
                racing community, or just comedy...

     They walk around in their own branded clothing. Alexander's
     jacket reads, "Le Patron". He speaks to MOSS.

     Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise,
     curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..

                          STIRLING MOSS
                It's certainly the first time I can
                remember seeing a butler serving
                caviar and oysters in the pits...

     Suddenly pandemonium breaks out. Screams. Something has
     happened. A bad accident on the track. During testing...

                          STIRLING MOSS
                    (holding ear-piece)
                ...reports are reaching me of a
                serious accident that has just taken
                place in qualifying....

     All smiles fade. The party atmosphere changes in a flash.
     Panic breaks out.

     The sound of sirens. Ambulances rushing to the scene of the
     accident. All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too.

     HESKETH, BUBBLES and JAMES look at one another, put down their
     champagne glasses, and follow...


46   EXT. RACE TRACK - SPAIN - DAY                                    46

     Mangled wreckage. A car has crashed into (badly installed)
     Armco guard rails, splitting the railing in two...

     The DRIVER has been decapitated. His helmeted HEAD lies
     cleanly severed on the ground...

     A goldfish-bowl of blood.

     It's a horrific accident. People SCREAM and look away. Even
     hardened medical professionals...

     JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident.
     But they are kept away, at a distance...

                            STIRLING MOSS
                  ...it seems the driver...just twenty-
                  six years old....was killed on
                  impact...and the death toll in Formula
                  1 shows no sign of slowing down...


47   INT. HESKETH PITS - SPANISH GRAND PRIX - DAY                     47

     JAMES, dressed in his overalls, is violently retching. Sick
     with nerves. A TV plays in the pits...

                            COMMENTATOR
                  ...in the last five years alone
                  Formula 1 has lost Piers Courage, Jo
                  Siffert, Peter Revson, Jochen Rindt,
                  Francois Cevert, Roger Williamson...

     ON TV: quickfire clips of the terrible, violent deaths.
     BUBBLES hastily switches off the TV as JAMES walks past...


48   EXT. PADDOCK - DAY                                               48

     JAMES walks out of the paddock, towards his car. Other DRIVERS
     gathered in concerned groups, talking...

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
                  It's terrible.

                            JAMES
                  They should cancel the race.

     Then, a distinctive Austrian accent..

                            NIKI
                  Why? No one came to see him anyway.
                  He made a mistake. Went into the
                  corner too fast.

                            JAMES
                  Is that right? So says the nobody who
                  had to pay for his own drive. How's
                  that working out, by the way?

                            NIKI
                  Fine. How's it at the back?

                            JAMES
                  Not planning on being there for long.

                            NIKI
                  Good. Look forward to you showing me
                  the way today.

                            JAMES
                  `Be happy to. I'll have you inside lap
                  one.

                            NIKI
                  Yeah right.

     JAMES walks off to his car, shaking his head..

                             JAMES
                  Asshole.

     NIKI walks to his car, putting on his helmet.

                  Asshole.

     His eyes meet JAMES's..


60   INT. BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT                                         60

     JAMES and BUBBLES and PETER HUNT (JAMES's blazer-wearing
     manager and elder brother), sit together at a table in the
     corner. It's late. A frank post-mortem. Drinking and talking..

                          JAMES
                Niki humiliated me today. He lapped me
                three times.

                          BUBBLES
                He lapped Carlos Pace six times.

                          JAMES
                That's supposed to console me? What do
                I need to do?

                           PETER
                Grow up.

                          JAMES
                Shut up, Moneyman. `Didn't ask you..

                           BUBBLES
                Your brother's right. You've got to
                change your attitude. We all do. And
                match it with a whole different mental
                approach. Professionalism. Maturity.
                Like Niki.

                          PETER
                Bet he doesn't go out every night,
                drink and screw himself stupid.

                          JAMES
                So speaks the jealous married man..

                          PETER
                No. So speaks the manager who's
                wasting his time, making ten per cent

                  You've just got to take it more
                  seriously. Yourself more seriously.

                            PETER
                  Something he's never done.

                            JAMES
                  Don`t patronize me, Pete...

                            BUBBLES
                  We need you to spend less time in bars
                  and nightclubs...

                            PETER
                  Make that NO time...

                            BUBBLES
                  And more time with the mechanics,
                  setting up the car. That's what Lauda
                  does. 24 hours a day.

     JAMES rolls his eyes...

                            BUBBLES
                  God knows there's nothing wrong with
                  your talent. Or courage. It's purely a
                  character issue right now.

                            JAMES
                  And the good news is I've got Sigmund
                  Freud Horsely, failed driver par
                  excellence, and a washed-up accountant
                  to lecture me on it.

                      (closes eyes)

67   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        67

     The grand Hesketh estate in the Northamptonshire countryside.


68   INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY             68

     JAMES is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he's
     been working on the car - but now his eyes are closed.
     Memorizing tracks. Around him people are working on the car..

                          JAMES
                ....along the Beau Rivage, long left
                into Massenet, into the short right of
                Casino. Sharp right into Mirabeau,
                then sharp left into Loews, mind the
                guard rails...

                          VOICE
                Is Alexander around..?

     JAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop-
     dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY
     MILLER, the most successful model of the day.

                          JAMES
                He was. Then went to the house to take
                a call. He'll be back shortly.

                           SUZY
                Only he wanted to show off his pride
                and joy...

     SUZY indicates the car...

                          SUZY
                ...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me.
                And `toy'. I can't believe what I'm
                seeing.

                          JAMES
                Why?

                          SUZY
                It's just so small! For something that
                costs so much. And so flimsy. There's
                no comfort. No protection. Nothing.

                          JAMES
                No. Just a little coffin, surrounded
                by high-octane fuel, being driven
                round at 170 miles per hour..

                            JAMES (contíd)
                      (becoming grave)
                  To all intents and purposes a bomb. On
                  wheels.

                            SUZY
                  Why don't they make it safer?

                            JAMES
                  No one wants it to be. It's like
                  saying why not make bullfighting
                  safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of
                  death turns people on. Without it, I
                  guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is
                  fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV,
                  fine for everyone..
                      (a beat)
                  ...except us drivers.

     SUZY looks JAMES up and down. Sees the bare feet, the rock
     star good looks...

                            SUZY
                  You're James, aren't you?

                             JAMES
                  Yes.

                            SUZY
                  Thought so. You fit the description.
                      (shaking hands)
                  Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

                            JAMES
                  I know exactly.

     In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of
     SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She's clearly the most famous
     model in Britain, and a star in her own right...

                            JAMES
                  What was the description?

                            SUZY
                  Mostly positive in terms of
                  appearance. Negative only in terms of
                  character. I've been told to avoid
                  you.

                             JAMES
                  By whom?

                            SUZY
                  Alex. He says you're a bad boy.

                          JAMES
                Was. Not any more. New me very
                professional. Early to bed. Early to
                rise. All very dull.

                          SUZY
                Really?

                          JAMES
                Round-the-clock work, practise and
                focus. Tedious, but apparently the
                only way to vin against ze
                Goosestepper..

                          SUZY
                Is that what you were doing when you
                came in?

                          JAMES
                Visualization techniques. Memorizing
                the circuit, in this case Monaco,
                which is next up. Eyes closed, know
                your way round in your sleep...
                    (a beat)
                I know...I've always been a great
                believer in getting there on the day,
                putting the old foot down and playing
                chicken with everyone else.

     SUZY laughs..

                          JAMES
                But they don't want me to do that
                anymore...they want my body like a
                temple. My mind like Monk.

                          SUZY
                And your soul? Your heart?

                          JAMES
                What does that mean?

                          SUZY
                You can't be so disciplined in all
                areas of your life, can you..?

                          JAMES
                They want me to stop messing around,
                get married and settle down with the
                next nice girl I meet. They think it
                would be good for me.

                          SUZY
                What do you think?

                Sounds bloody awful.

     SUZY laughs again...

                           JAMES
                But since they're right about most
                things, they're probably right about
                that, too.

     JAMES looks SUZY up and down...

                          JAMES

     JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding
     dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church.

     JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the
     paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and
     BUBBLES.

     They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars...

     On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC
     POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the
     crowd..

     SUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even

                  little longer than you'd hoped.
                      (a beat)
                  He's just been signed by Ferrari.

                  WHAT??? But that's the best team in
                  the world. They could have ANYONE. Did
                  he pay his way in there, too?

                            BUBBLES
                  Apparently they took back Regazzoni
                  and he insisted they give Lauda a
                  trial. Thinks he's a genius. Setting
                  up the cars...

     JAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with
     SUZY and her FAMILY.

     ENZO FERRARI himself, the Commendatore, a formidable white-
     haired patriarch in Onassis dark glasses, reads newspapers,
     sitting by the race tracks, barely looking up as two red
     Ferrari's roar round the track...

     LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, the young, dynamic, aristocratic manager
     of the Scuderia, by contrast, watches eagle-eyed..


72C EXT. FIORANO - TRACKSIDE - LATER                                 72C

     The two cars stop, and NIKI and CLAY REGAZZONI gets out. NIKI
     talks (in a mix of Italian and English) to his MECHANIC,
     giving them typically blunt feedback...

                 I've driven better milk floats. It
                 understeers like crazy and the weight
                 distribution is a disaster...

     The MECHANIC gulps, then walks over to where the terrifying
     COMMENDATORE and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO are sitting, and passes
     on the information...

                           MECHANIC
                 He says the car is magnificent, a
                 masterpiece, but he has suggestions
                 for one or two minor refinements...

     A car drives fast on country roads in Northern Italy...

                            REGAZZONI (contíd)
                  You're friend and family to the
                  Commendatore as long as you win. The
                  minute you don't..
                      (mimes execution)

                            NIKI
                  I understand. It's business. I would
                  be the same.

                            REGAZZONI
                  But it isn't just business, is it?
                  What we do? It's passion. Love. Which
                  is why we're prepared to risk our
                  lives for it.

                            NIKI
                  Not me. If I thought I had more talent
                  and could earn better money doing
                  something else, I would.

                            REGAZZONI
                  But how do you know you will make
                  money here? You haven't yet.

                            NIKI
                  Not yet. But I will.
                      (smiles)
                  If you can, I can.

     REGAZZONI shakes his head, can't help smiling...

                            REGAZZONI
                  You know, are you ever NOT an asshole?

     NIKI laughs...

                            NIKI
                  Why am I an asshole? You know by now
                  I'm both quicker than you and better
                  at setting up the car. You can't deal
                  with that, then you're the asshole.

                               REGAZZONI
                  Screw you.

     REGAZZONI pulls up outside the house...

                            REGAZZONI (contíd)
                  I brought you along today because you
                  seem like a lonely kind of guy. I
                  thought if I introduce you to some
                  nice people, it'd be good for you.
                  Forget it. Make your own friends.

     REGAZZONI walks ahead, disappears through the front door,
     where he is warmly welcomed, and invited into a party.

     NIKI calls after him...

                          NIKI
                I'm sorry. C'mon, Clay...


76   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY                        76

     NIKI stares through the window. Inside: a very appealing
     looking bunch - young, good-looking, cool, sexy GUESTS - all
     having a good time..

     By contrast: NIKI catches his own reflection in the glass
     reflection. Pale. Intense. The outsider.

     Inside: REGAZZONI is surrounded by friends, telling a story.
     Everyone laughs.

     NIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front
     door opens...

     And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading
     several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress.

                          NIKI
                Are you leaving?

                          MARLENE
                Yes.

                          NIKI
                Can you give me a lift to the nearest
                town? Anywhere with a train station.

                          MARLENE
                Sure. Nearest town is half an hour's
                drive. Get in.

     The car drives. The radio plays. Marlene sings along. NIKI
     can't help noticing something. He turns down the music.
     MARLENE's smile fades..

                          MARLENE
                What are you doing?

                            NIKI
                  You hear that noise when you
                  accelerate?

                             MARLENE
                  No.

                            NIKI
                  Your drive belt is loose.

                             MARLENE
                  My what?

                            NIKI
                  Alternator. And when you brake, your
                  foot goes all the way down. Means
                  there's air in the system.

                            MARLENE
                  Anything else?

                            NIKI
                  No. Apart from the rear brakes are
                  imbalanced. The front right wheel is
                  flat, and it feels like a crack in the
                  engine block...which explains why
                  you're drifting so much.

                            MARLENE
                  How can you tell?

                             NIKI
                  My ass.

                             MARLENE
                  What?

                            NIKI
                  God gave me an OK mind, but a really
                  good ass, which can feel everything in
                  a car.

                            MARLENE
                  You don't know what you're talking
                  about. The car is fine. And it just
                  had a service a week ago.

                            NIKI
                  Not a good one.

                            MARLENE
                  A very good one. From a proper garage.
                  It cost a fortune. This car is good as
                  new. Relax.
                                                                          45



79   EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY                             79

     White smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down.
     Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail.

     NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but
     disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine.

     NIKI's hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a
     large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.

                          NIKI
                Nothing I can do here. The car needs a
                garage.

                          MARLENE
                I'm sorry. You're not in a hurry, are
                you?

                          NIKI
                No. As long as I'm back in Maranello
                by Monday morning.

     NIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb...

                          MARLENE
                So who are you anyway?

     MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)...

                          MARLENE
                You're from Vienna, aren't you. We can
                speak German. How do you know Curd?

                          NIKI
                Who's Curd?

                          MARLENE
                Curd Jurgens. The actor. It's his
                house. He is, or was until yesterday,
                my boyfriend. I must have been mad!
                There is something very attractive
                about an older man when they behave
                like one. But when they behave like a
                frightened child..

     MARLENE gets to her feet...

                           MARLENE
                C'mon, let me do this. Otherwise we'll
                never get out of here. We're in Italy,
                after all.

     MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches
     up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs..

     SSSCCCREEEEEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!!

     Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses
     noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI...

                            MARLENE
                  Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it,
                  you're impressed..!

     MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian
     MEN driving the open-topped sports car..

                            MARLENE
                  Ciao, Regazzi...!

     But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if
     she's invisible, and stare at NIKI...

                            ITALIAN MAN
                      (in Italian)
                  Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?

                            NIKI
                  Yes.

                            ITALIAN MAN
                      (in Italian)
                  Oh, my God...!!! I told you it was
                  him..!!!
                      (blown away)
                  Do you need a ride?

                            NIKI
                  Yes, we do...

     The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads
     MARLENE's luggage inside...

                            ITALIAN MAN
                  An honour, please!!! But on one
                  condition..

     The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI's ear. MARLENE stares, not
     understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly
     gets into the car. He starts the engine.

     MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with
     the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..

                            MARLENE
                  Will someone please tell me what's
                  going on?

     MARLENE turns to NIKI...

                          MARLENE
                Who are you, anyway? What do you DO?

                          ITALIAN MAN
                You don't know? He's a Formula I
                driver. Who just signed for Ferrari!

                          MARLENE
                Him? Never. Impossible!

                            ITALIAN MAN
                Why?

                          MARLENE
                Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are
                sexy, have shirts open to here..

     MARLENE indicates...

                          MARLENE
                Anyway, look at the way he's driving!!
                Like an old man!!

     It's true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.

                          NIKI
                No need to drive fast. It only
                increases the percentage of risk.
                We're not in a hurry. No one is paying
                me. Right now, with zero incentive or
                reward, why would I drive fast?

     MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...

                          MARLENE
                    (in German)
                Because I'm asking you to.

                          NIKI
                    (in German)
                And do you always get what you want?

                          MARLENE
                    (in German)
                Usually.

     NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot. He does a
     lightning double-declutch...

     "SLAM", NIKI's foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the
     rev counter flies to the right...

     And the open-topped sports car lurches into warp-drive...

     MARLENE is thrown back hard in her seat, "Jesus", her eyes
     widen in terror and amazement..

                          MARLENE
                Oh, my God...!!

     The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life
     as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to
     breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before...

     NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving
     between cars at twice their speed..

     We CLOSE on NIKI's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers
     scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other
     cars on the motorway...

     His EYES remain calm, his WHEELS a blur of speed, and we...

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:


80   EXT. USA GP - WATKINS GLEN - 5TH OCTOBER 1975 - TRACK - DAY      80

     Calm EYES, and WHEELS moving in a blur of speed. We're in the
     middle of a Grand Prix, and NIKI is driving at the limit...

     CAPTION: "1975".

     Ahead of him: a familiar sight. The back of JAMES HUNT's
     Hesketh..


81   EXT. PITS - DAY                                                  81

     MARLENE watches on TV in the pits as NIKI is engaged in an
     epic tussle with JAMES...

     Commentators note the improvement in JAMES's technique,
     maturity and performance. But then, "Puff", a plume of smoke
     comes out of JAMES's engine. The engine has blown...

     Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking
     effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag.

     Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI
     LAUDA has become world champion...


82   EXT. FERRARI PITS/USA GP TRACK SIDE - DAY                        82

     NIKI's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he
     gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a
     delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO...

     ...then falling into a passionate kiss with MARLENE...

     Champion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by
     REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German,
     English...


83   EXT. USA GP/PADDOCK - DAY                                       83

     An impromptu party in the paddock area. The victor's garland
     still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion
     trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through
     the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations..

     He runs into JAMES, who's in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is
     pulled away to talk to someone else..

                            JAMES
                  Congratulations.

                               NIKI
                  Thank you.

                            JAMES
                  Though with a car like that, the rest
                  of us never stood a chance...

                            NIKI
                  Maybe the fact the car is so good
                  might have something to do with me.

                            JAMES
                  You're still in a Ferrari. And I'm
                  still in a Hesketh. On equal terms,
                  the way it was in Formula 3, I'd beat
                  you, and you know it.

                            NIKI
                  Never. You might get lucky and win one
                  race. Maybe two. Because you're
                  aggressive. But in the long run, over
                  the course of a season, no chance.

                            JAMES
                  Why's that?

                            NIKI
                  Because you're not serious. You're
                  just a party guy. Which is why
                  everyone likes you.

                            JAMES
                  Now try saying that and tell me you're
                  not jealous.

                            NIKI
                  But all that affection, all those
                  smiles is also a sign of their
                  disrespect! They don't fear you.
                  Whereas compare that to me...

                            JAMES
                  Whom no one likes...

                            NIKI
                  Right..

                            JAMES
                  Not even his own team-mates..

                            NIKI
                  Right! Because I'm relentless. I don't
                  screw up. I go to bed early. I look
                  after myself, look after my car. And
                  then, soon as the race is finished, I
                  go home. You should go home more
                  often, too. I heard you got married.

                            JAMES
                  I did.

                            NIKI
                  So where is she?

                            JAMES
                  In New York. Working.

                            NIKI
                  You know I've never seen you with her,
                  once...

     NIKI turns to MARLENE, "Let's go"..


84   EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                        84

     JAMES's Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway
     towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt.

     JAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he
     uncharacteristically ignores, storming past...


85   INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY                             85

     JAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy
     doing something...

                            JAMES
                  Right, whatever it takes to beat
                  Lauda, just say it, your word is my
                  command. I'll do it. There are no
                  lengths to which I will not go. And I
                  mean it this time...

     JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES's expression...

                            JAMES
                  What's the matter?

     Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He's packing.

                            JAMES
                  What are you doing?

     Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None
     of the usual mechanics, or engineers..

                            JAMES
                  Where is everyone?

     BUBBLES looks up. Unsure how to break it to him.


86   INT. DRAWING-ROOM - EASTON NESTON - DAY                          86

     An old drawing-room. The open fire roars. But HESKETH is
     uncharacteristically quiet. Defeated..

                            HESKETH
                  Do you know what the date is today?

                            JAMES
                  November 14th.

                            HESKETH
                  Do you have any idea of the
                  significance of that date?

                            JAMES
                  I'm assuming it refers to some animal
                  you are allowed or no longer allowed
                  to slaughter on your estate.

                            HESKETH
                  Actually it's the deadline for
                  securing sponsorship for the
                  forthcoming Formula 1 season.
                      (a beat)
                  Which elapsed at midnight last night.
                  And we didn't attract any.

                            JAMES
                  So? We aren't looking for sponsorship.
                  Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right?

                            HESKETH
                  Right. Except we are. Or were. I've
                  made something of a miscalculation.
                  The economics. Formula 1. Reality
                  thereof. Turns out not like the lower
                  divisions at all.

                            JAMES
                  What are you saying?

                            HESKETH
                  I'm saying it's over, Superstar. The
                  banks have stepped in. Read me the
                  riot act. Started laying everyone off.
                  Probably have to sell this place. Fun
                  while it lasted, would do it all again
                  and all that...
                      (ashen)
                  I daren't tell you the actual figures.

     JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...

                  Christ.


87   INT. JAMES'S FLAT - LONDON - NIGHT                              87

     JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing
     Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...

                            JAMES
                  I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find
                  me a drive.
                      (listens)
                  What does that mean? "My reputation
                  precedes me?"

     "Crash", the electric toy car crashes...

                             JAMES
                      (listens)
                  Really? Is that what they said?
                      (a beat)
                  Did they at least say a "Quick
                  arsehole?"
                      (listens)
                  Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone
                  else. I'll go mad otherwise.

     "Click", JAMES hangs up. SUZY walks in. Sees his mood..

                  Don't worry. Something will turn up.

     JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...

                            SUZY
                  But I doubt that will help in the
                  meantime.

     JAMES knocks back the drink...

                            SUZY
                  Why don't we go away for the week-end?
                  Before I leave again for New York?

     JAMES carries on drinking..

                            SUZY
                  Talk to me, James. Don't make a
                  stranger of me.

     JAMES doesn't react...

                            SUZY
                  I can't watch this.

     SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..

                            JAMES
                  What were you hoping for? A well-
                  adjusted knight in shining armour?

                            SUZY
                  No danger of that....

                            JAMES
                  Let me give you some advice.

                            SUZY
                  I'm all ears...

                            JAMES
                  Don't go to men who are willing to
                  kill themselves driving in circles
                  looking for normality.

                            SUZY
                  Well, I certainly didn't get that...

                            JAMES
                  Should have gone for one of my

                          JAMES
                What's that? Tell me..

                          SUZY
                The gulf between appearance and
                reality. Look at you, all sunshine
                blonde beauty and smiles...yet the
                reality is...a frightened, immature,
                depressed, self-pitying child...

                          JAMES
                At least there's SOMETHING behind the

                Fuck off to New York, dear. There must
                be a moisturizer or eye shadow
                somewhere that needs your vapid mush
                to flog it.

                          SUZY
                How quickly beauty can turn ugly.

                          JAMES
                Agreed. Repellent.

     SUZY stares...and goes. JAMES carries on drinking.

     The following morning. The phone rings. Piercing the darkness.
     JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved
     budgies...

                          JAMES
                Good girl...

     A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about
     JAMES. He strokes the birds with real tenderness..

     JAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes
     him sit up...

                            JAMES (INTO PHONE)
                  Who? McLaren?

     JAMES is waking rapidly now..

                  Just get me in a room with them, Pete.

                      (checks watch)

91   EXT. MCLAREN HQ - TO ESTABLISH                                   91

     The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks.

     A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate. Bare
     brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words
     `MCLAREN RACING' in large white letters.


92   INT. MCLAREN HQ - BOARDROOM - DAY                                92

     A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from
     Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50's - hair turning grey) sits
     at the head of the table.

     Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and
     McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL.

     The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...

                            MAYER
                  I'll come straight to the point. Our
                  esteemed lead driver...

                            CALDWELL
                  Fitti-fucking-paldi..

                            MAYER
                  Has ditched us for another team at the
                  last minute..

                            CALDWELL
                  In November. Fucking outrageous.

                            MAYER
                  And we need a replacement. Asap.
                  Thankfully a few hands have already
                  gone up. Good people...

                            CALDWELL
                  Like Jackie Ickx.

                            JAMES
                  I'm quicker than Jackie.

                            MAYER
                  But he's consistent, dependable.
                  Sponsor friendly. He'll dress up nice.
                  Say the right things.

                            JAMES
                  What do you want? A driver or a
                  brushes salesman?

                            MAYER
                  We want to be successful.

                            JAMES
                  So do I. But I measure that in podium
                  finishes and beating Niki Lauda not
                  being a show pony for sponsors.

                            MAYER
                  I've heard about this thing with
                  Lauda.

                            CALDWELL
                      (rolls eyes)
                  Everyone has..

                            MAYER
                  You really think you can beat him?
                  He's World Champion.

                            JAMES
                  I beat him in Formula 3.

                            CALDWELL
                  This season alone he's had eight
                  podiums, five wins, you've had what?

                            HOGAN
                  One.

                            JAMES
                  Only because I've been in the wrong
                  car. I beat him when the playing field
                  was level. I'd beat him again in a
                  McLaren.

                It's the only car out there as good as
                the Ferrari. Which is why I'm here,
                begging.

     JAMES stares imploringly..

                          JAMES
                I'll do whatever you ask. Even put on
                a suit, talk to sponsors and say the
                right thing. I promise.

                           NIKI
                 What are you talking about?

                           JAMES
                 I won that race in Spain. And you know
                 it.

                           NIKI
                 In an illegal car.

                           JAMES
                 The aerofoil was five eighths of an
                 inch too long!! Something that doesn't
                 have the slightest effect on car
                 speed. You complained. Now we've had
                 to totally rebuild the car and it's
                 become a monster.

                           NIKI
                 At least it's a LEGAL monster.

                           JAMES
                 A car that was beating you week in
                 week out, so you have to resort to
                 this. Cheating.

                           NIKI
                 He drives in an illegal car and he
                 calls ME the cheat? Let me tell you:
                 two weeks before that race in Spain,
                 we put 20-inch rims on the rear
                 wheels. We get an extra half second
                 speed on each lap!! But the Old Man
                 tells me we can't use those rims, they
                 make the car too wide. Against the
                 rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims
                 making the car slower again. Rules are
                 rules. For all of us. You're just a
                 bad loser who can't accept that.
                     (tapping head, to MARLENE)
                 Komm, he's crazy. Sick in the head.

   NIKI turns to MARLENE, speaks in German...

                           NIKI
                 Den Trottel lassen wir alleine..
                     (Let's go. Leave this jerk
                      alone.)
                 No wonder she left him...

   NIKI and MARLENE go. JAMES is left staring. Not understanding.


114 INT/EXT. ZOLDER PADDOCK/ MCLAREN TRUCK - DAY                   114

   JAMES walks into the crowded MCLAREN pits. Sees TEDDY MAYER
   and ALASTAIR CALDWELL...

                           JAMES
                 Is there something I should know about
                 Suzy? Where is she? Wasn't she
                 supposed to be here today?

   CALDWELL nervously indicates the Sunday newspapers...

                           CALDWELL
                 We kept it from you. Didn't want to
                 tell you before the race...

   JAMES looks at the newspapers, then his expression changes.

   A grand, five-star hotel overlooking Central Park in
   Manhattan's mid-town district...


118 EXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY                                   118

   A huge collection of paparazzi SNAPPERS and Journalist HACKS
   is camped outside the hotel.

   Immediately a surge of activity, "Here he is"...

   A burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the
   JOURNALISTS as JAMES - gets out of the taxi and runs the
   gauntlet of humiliation...

   ...into the hotel..

   A large hotel suite. There are flowers everywhere. Newspapers
   are all over the table.

   JAMES sits opposite SUZY. He sees an expensive gift; recently
   opened. A diamond necklace..

                           JAMES
                 That from him?

   SUZY nods. Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a
   fortune.

                           SUZY
                 Why have you come here, James?

                           JAMES
                 To get you back.

                           SUZY
                 You don't want me back...you never
                 wanted to be married in the first
                 place. You did it because you hoped it
                 might change you...settle you down...
                 help with the racing. Not because you
                 loved me. And who knows, if it had
                 been just the drinking, or the dope,
                 or the infidelity, or the moods...it
                 might even have worked...but when it's
                 all of them?

                           JAMES
                 I know. I'm terrible.

                           SUZY
                 No, you're not terrible. You're
                 just...who you are...at this point in
                 your life. And God help anyone that
                 wants more.

                           JAMES
                 Will he be able to give you more? He
                 has quite the bad boy reputation
                 himself.

                           SUZY
                 What's important is how it feels to
                 me. And it feels like he adores me.

   A flicker behind JAMES's eyes. Failure.

                           JAMES
                 Right.

                           SUZY
                 He's aware of the delicacy of the
                 situation, and how it looks. Having
                 raided your larder. Plundered your
                 safe. Smash and grab, and so forth. So
                 he's assured me he'll take care of the
                 financial side. And will be very
                 generous.

   JAMES manages a brave smile.

                           JAMES
                 Fine. I'll give him a call.

               No. His lawyers will contact you.

   JAMES notices the vast unmade bed. Where, until recently, two
   people had slept.


121AEXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY                                  121A

   JAMES emerges from the hotel - into the storm of paparazzi
   again. He manages a brave smile...

                         JAMES
               It's all very amicable. My wife has
               found herself a new backer...I mean
               lover...which makes her happy..
                   (laughter)
               Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling
               young again...let's hope his pockets
               are deep...they'll need to be...
                   (laughter)
               And I've found a way to be single
               again without it costing me a penny,
               which has to go down as the biggest
               win of my career.

   Laughter from the JOURNALISTS who are hungrily writing down
   the copy. But JAMES's hollow smile fools no one...


122 INT. JUMBO JET - FIRST CLASS - DAY                             122

   JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the
   track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full
   glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone
   on the plane.

   A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles.


123 INT. JUMBO JET - WC - DAY                                      123

   JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard.

   Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking
   out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.
   Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...

   OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...


123AINT. FRENCH GP 1976 - PAUL RICARD - 4TH JULY 1976             123A

   Suzy's words still ringing in his ears.

   Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car
   shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

   Where death has become a real option.

   Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves
   anyway...

   And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has
   unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an
   advantage over everyone else...

   The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become
   an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared
   to take...

   So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every
   gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

   The chequered flag waves again as JAMES's car roars across the

   A crowded PRESS room. In opposite corners of the room, JAMES
   and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV
   journalists. Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES...

                           STIRLING MOSS
                 ...James, a few weeks ago, you were
                 out of the running for this season
                 completely, now you're right back in
                 it. What's changed...?

   Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting "James, we love
   you." JAMES stares across the room at NIKI...

                           JAMES
                 A combination of factors, not all of
                 which I'm prepared to discuss here.
                 Justice being done re: the
                 disqualification in Spain helps, and
                 having my old car back of course...

                 Mathematically in theory it's now
                 possible for Hunt to catch you. Are
                 you worried?

                           NIKI
                 Not at all. For him to catch me, he'd
                 have to win all the remaining races,
                 and I'd have to lose them. And pigs
                 would have to fly.

   Laughter among the confident GERMANS.

                           NIKI
                 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a
                 private family matter to attend to.

   Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.

137 INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - IBIZA - NIGHT                           137

   MARLENE is fast asleep. She wakes, to discover the bed is
   empty beside her..


138 INT. HOUSE - IBIZA - NIGHT                                     138

   MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds
   him on a balcony...alone..

                         MARLENE
               Come to bed.

   MARLENE notices his mood. It's different.

                         MARLENE
               What's the matter?

                         NIKI
               It's the enemy, you know. Happiness.

   NIKI looks up at MARLENE...

                         NIKI
               It weakens you. Puts doubt in your
               mind. Because all of a sudden you have
               something to lose..

   MARLENE stares at him.

                         MARLENE
               When you call happiness an enemy, then
               it's too late.
                   (a beat)
               Then you have lost already.

   MARLENE turns, and goes..

   NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is
   struggling with something for the first time. Fear.


139 EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY                                         139

   The notoriously difficult and treacherous German race track.

   Testing is underway. A CAR (from one of the other teams)
   skids, and crashes violently.
                                                                         71



139AEXT. NURBURGRING - CRASH SITE - DAY                         139A

   AMBULANCES arrive. The Driver is badly hurt. Screaming in
   pain. His leg is crushed. Bone is sticking out. A brutal
   compound fracture. He is taken away.


139BINT/EXT. NURBURGRING PITLANE - DAY                          139B

   In the pits, everyone is shaken. JAMES, REGAZZONI, and other
   DRIVERS nervously talk among themselves as the Ambulance races
   past.

   NIKI's face: visibly pale. More frightened than ever.


140 EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY                                         140

   Race-day. Huge crowds arrive at the Nurburgring. And rain.
   Heavy rain falling.

   Television commentary informs us about the Nurburgring's
   terrible reputation as a `graveyard' track.


141 EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY                                         141

   JAMES arrives at the race track, to find ALASTAIR CALDWELL
   waiting for him, a concerned look on his face...

                         CALDWELL
               We've just been told, a driver's
               meeting has been called.

                         JAMES
               Who by?

                         CALDWELL
               Niki.

   JAMES's face. Instantly suspicious.


142 INT. MEETING ROOM - NURBURGRING RACE TRACK - DAY               142

   About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team
   REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered
   FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are
   sitting behind a table...

   A buzz of anticipation and curiosity. What's going on? What is
   all this about? NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands
   calling for silence...




                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                                        72
142 CONTINUED:                                                    142


                           NIKI
                 Thank you. I called this meeting
                 because as all drivers know the
                 Nurburgring is a race track from the
                 Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
                 outdated, dangerous, track in the
                 world. You've all seen the rain which
                 has been falling this morning. Those
                 of you with experience know the Ring
                 needs perfect conditions to be even
                 remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
                 As you can see today is anything BUT
                 perfect, so I called this meeting to
                 take a vote to cancel the race.

   A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..

                            NIKI
                 There would be no change to the
                 situation as far as points is
                 concerned. The race would simply be
                 cancelled.

   TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....

                           MAYER
                 This is bullshit...

   Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...

                           EDWARDS
                 If the race is cancelled, none of us
                 get our race fees...

                           NIKI
                 It's true. You leave without your fee,
                 but you might leave with your LIFE.

   Another voice pierces the controversy...

                           VOICE
                 It also means you would effectively
                 win the championship.

   It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...

                           JAMES
                 So I can see why this suits you just
                 fine.

                           NIKI
                 Why? There would be no points for me
                 either...




                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                                       73
142 CONTINUED: (2)                                               142


                         JAMES
               But there would be one race less where
               I, or anyone else, could catch you.

   Uproar in the room...

                         BRETT LUNGER
               James is right! This is just tactics!

                         ARTURO MERZARIO
               Ferrari's dirty tricks! We've seen it
               before!

                         HARALD ERTL
               Maybe it's just that he's frightened?

   Laughter among the DRIVERS...

                         NIKI
               Which asshole said this?

   Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.

                         NIKI
               Yes, I am frightened. Always a little
               bit when I race. I accept every time I
               get in my car there is 20% chance that
               I could die. But not one per cent
               more. And today, with the rain the
               risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
               of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
               I have the track record here. I am the
               only person in history to do the Ring
               in under 7 minutes. So actually it's
               to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
               Because I'm quicker than all of you.

   A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...

                         JAMES
               Fine. Then let's race!

   It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and
   enthusiasm among the other drivers...

                         JAMES
               There's a hundred thousand fans out
               there who would never forgive us if we
               didn't.

                         MERZARIO
               And some of us need our race fees!!




                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                                         74
142 CONTINUED: (3)                                                142


                         FIA OFFICIAL
               All those in favour of cancelling the
               race?

   NIKI puts his hand up. One or two other racers, too...

                         FIA OFFICIAL
               All those in favour of racing?

   JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic
   figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.

                         FIA OFFICIAL
               Gentlemen, start your engines!!

   A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.

   Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one
   another a discreet hi-five...

   But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at
   JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.


143 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                       143

   "RRRROAAAR", an explosion of noise, as we widen and find
   ourselves on the starting grid of the German Grand Prix.

   An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
   Minute"...

   Deafening, angry thunder, as cars rev their engines.


143AAN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                143A

   A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
   Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..


144 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                144

   This time the eye belongs to JAMES. He stares up at the
   clouds.

   His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an
   all important decision...

   Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry?

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the
   noise - no time to plug his headset in...




                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                                        75
144 CONTINUED:                                                    144


                           CALDWELL
                 Jochen's going on slicks. You want to
                 change?

   JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN
   MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.

   White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the
   tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over
   at the car beside him...

                           JAMES
                 Has Niki changed?

                           CALDWELL
                 No. He's going on wets.

   NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.

                           JAMES
                 Then we go on wets, too.

   JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a
   split-second, then...

   The STARTER waves the flag. They're off!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost
   9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The
   car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black
   scars on the asphalt..

   JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,
   but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,
   gaining fast.

   JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white
   helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.

   MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses
   under his breath...

                            JAMES
                 Shit...!

   JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs
   to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

   He swerves angrily into the pits..
                                                                         76



145 INT. PITS - DAY                                                145

   Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
   crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to
   change to dry tyres.

   The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with
   air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..

                         CALDWELL
               See? I told you to go on slicks!! You
               didn't take my advice...

                         JAMES
               Shut up! Where's Niki?

                         CALDWELL
               Behind you! He made the same mistake!

   JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him
   in the pits, then...

   "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the
   signal, `Clear!'

                         CALDWELL
               Go! Go!! Go!!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres,
   leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...


146 EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                          146

   Archive commentary: from the world's TV stations informs us
   that JAMES roars up into 3rd position..


147 INT. JAMES'S CAR - DAY                                         147

   JAMES gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
   breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.

   The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The
   car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No
   thought of failure..

   Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.

   He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees
   something ahead.

   Flags. Red flags. RACE MARSHALLS. Something has clearly
   happened. An accident..

   The race is being stopped. JAMES brakes, slowing down. He
   pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL..

                              JAMES
                 What's up?

                           MARSHALL
                 Accident. Bad one.

                              JAMES
                 Who?

148 INT. NIKI'S CAR - SAME TIME                                     148

   NIKI's POV: a continuation of the opening scene. Burning smoke
   fills NIKI's helmet, burning his lungs. He cries out in agony.

                           NIKI
                 AAAAARRRRGHGHGGHGH!!!!

   We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the
   other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in
   the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...

   We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in
   the driver's meeting. HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO
   MERZARIO, GUY EDWARDS...

   Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Covering NIKI's helmet.
   Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and
   fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..

   The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages.
   Screaming voices. Panicked reactions.

   Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

   OVER THIS: the hypnotic sound of helicopter blades...

                           NIKI (V/O)
                 August 1st, 1976, I discovered comas

149 EXT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY                        149

   NIKI's POV: the door to a helicopter opens, as it arrives at
   Mannheim University Hospital...

   The sound of shouting voices. Hospital STAFF pull reach
   towards NIKI, pull his stretcher out.

   NIKI's internal voice groans: cries out at the pain.

                         NIKI (V/O)
               Some things are better not remembered.


150 INT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY                        150

   "Crash", doors burst open and NIKI is rushed into emergency.
   Neon ceiling lights pass overhead...

   The sound of difficult breathing.

   His stretcher is surrounded by DOCTORS, talking urgently,
   making quick assessments..

   NIKI's POV: fading in and out of consciousness.

   Bursts of concerned, urgent, overlapping dialogue among the
   German DOCTORS which NIKI can barely make out..


151 INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - MANNHEIM HOSPITAL - DAY             151

   Two narrow, barely open slits of light. NIKI's swollen eye-
   lids. NIKI's POV: barely making out MARLENE standing beside
   the senior burns specialist DOCTOR. NIKI hears voices...

                         DOCTOR
               It's not the burns to his face that
               are the danger. It's the burns to his
               lungs. His blood oxygen level is
               currently...

                         NURSE
               6.8.

                         DOCTOR
               Which is not enough to maintain
               life...

   NIKI slips out of consciousness again. MARLENE is distraught,
   in tears.

155 INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT                        155

   JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while
   feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown)..

   He feels terrible. He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and
   pen...

   JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to
   put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters
   in particular have never been his thing...

   JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. The
   budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..


156 INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY                                 156

   NIKI's P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his
   hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...

                         PRIEST
               ...durch diese heilige Salbung helfe
               dir der Herr in seinem reichen
               Erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der
               Kraft des Heiligen Geistes...

   NIKI's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see
   an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German..

   The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.

                         PRIEST
               Der Herr der dich von Sunden befreit,
               rette dich in seiner Gnade richte er
               dich auf...

   NIKI strains to move. A sense of excruciating pain.

   He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY
   indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive
   and able to fight for life...

   But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites.
   MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's
   shoulder...

                         NIKI (V/O)
               I'm here! Can't you tell? I'm here!

   NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them
   a sign. He's OK. He's still there. But it's no use.

   NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great.

                                                      FADE TO BLACK:


157 INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - DAY                                 157

   Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night
   supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS.

   Niki's MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI.

   Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a
   DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...

                           DOCTOR
                 Frau Lauda? Bitte kommen Sie! He's
                 awake! And just spoke!

   MARLENE scrambles to her feet...

                           MARLENE
                 What did he say?

                           DOCTOR
                 "Tell the Priest to fuck off! I'm
                 still alive!!"

   MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears.
   She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.


158 EXT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY                                 158

   Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's
   bed. She sees NIKI..

   And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to
   him how horrified she is.

   NIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's
   size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes.

   MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the
   shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.

160 INT. NIKI'S HOSPITAL ROOM/TELEVISION COVERAGE FULL FRAME -DAY 160

   The starter's flag drops. On television we see the Austrian
   Grand Prix start.

   NIKI watches the race on television, while beginning his rehab
   in bed, in pain as bandages are changed..

   ON TV: JAMES narrowly misses out on a podium, but still gains
   on NIKI in his points total...

   CAPTION: "RACE 11. HUNT FINISHES 4th"


161 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY - (A WEEK LATER)                           161

   NIKI continues his rehab in the hospital, now out of bed...

   ON TV: the starter's flag drops. Another Grand Prix starts.
   This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..

   NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum
   pump into his lungs. It's AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the
   perfect race...

                         YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR
               We need to vacuum the lungs. Without
               this, they can't heal. But it will
               hurt.

   An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs,
   to try to hoover out the impurities..

   COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with
   LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.

                         NIKI
               Aaarrrggghhhh...

   The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position.

   CAPTION: "RACE 12. HUNT WINS."

   The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment. He's
   had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside...

                          NIKI
               Again!!

   The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again.

   NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI's family
   cannot bear to watch...

   champagne.

   NIKI continues screaming in pain, watching the Canadian GP on
   TV as..

   CAPTION: "RACE 13 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX. HUNT WINS AGAIN"

   For the first time, JAMES has taken the lead in points. NIKI
   stares at the TV: his expression changes.

164 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                            164

   NIKI screams again. MARLENE, NIKI's family and the DOCTORS are
   deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...

                           NIKI
                 Aaaaarrrrggghghhhhhh!!

   We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing. What has caused these
   unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..

                           NIKI
                 I know what you're all thinking...

   Now we see. With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing
   helmet on for the first time. Pressing into his open burn
   wounds...

                           NIKI
                 But if you love me - all of you - you
                 won't say a word.

   He is almost unconscious with pain. His legs are weak. But he
   has done it...

   The Italian Grand Prix. TELEVISION COMMENTARY sets the scene.

   JAMES and the MCLAREN TEAM arrive in the pits to see a vast
   commotion going on elsewhere...

                 What's going on?

                           JAMES
                 What?? They said he was half-dead.

   JAMES stares. Shaken.


166 EXT. MONZA PITLANE/ FERRARI PITS - DAY                         166

   JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the
   crowded FERRARI pits. He sees a racer in the background. The
   name LAUDA on his overalls...

                           JAMES
                 Niki?

   NIKI turns round. JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time.

   JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. His bandages
   are blood stained. He has no hair. Looks grotesque..

   NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face. Sees the shock. The
   horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going
   to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.

                           NIKI
                 Wow. It's that bad, huh?

   JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.

                           NIKI
                 In the hospital I told them to tell me
                 straight, no bullshit - how bad it
                 would be. My appearance. They said
                 with time it'd be fine. But it won't.
                 I can tell, seeing your reaction. I am
                 going to spend the rest of my life
                 with a face that frightens people.

   NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival's beauty, his blonde,
   tanned perfection. His matinee idol, movie star looks...

                           NIKI
                 That's a tough one to get used to.

                            JAMES
                 I wrote you a letter at the time. To
                 apologize.

                 The driver's meeting in Germany?
                 Before the race? I swayed the room.

                           NIKI
                 Yes. You did.

                           JAMES
                 That race should never have gone
                 ahead.

                           NIKI
                 No.

                           JAMES
                 So in some ways...I feel responsible
                 for what happened. I'm sorry.

                            NIKI
                 Trust me, watching you win those
                 points and all those races while I was
                 in hospital fighting for my life...you
                 were equally responsible for getting
                 me better.

   Ouch. That could have been meant generously. But in this case
   it wasn't. It was a cold slap in the face.

   NIKI turns and goes.


167 INT. MONZA GRAND PRIX - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                 167

   A packed press conference. The world's media. NIKI's accident
   and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.
   This is front page news around the globe..

   NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the
   sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....

   NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on
   both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants
   to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 How are you feeling, Niki?

                           NIKI
                 Fine.

                           AMERICAN JOURNALIST
                 Can you confirm for us exactly which
                 procedures you have had? And the
                 expectations for your recovery?

                           NIKI
                 Sure. I had a skin graft operation
                 where they put half my right thigh in
                 my face. It doesn't look too good but
                 one unexpected advantage is it's
                 impossible to perspire through a skin
                 graft, so sweat will never run in my
                 eyes again - which is good for a
                 driver.

   Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in,
   (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.

                           BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST
                 When they heard about your condition,
                 Ferrari immediately hired another
                 driver, Carlos Reutemann.

                           NIKI
                 Ja. Before even my first operation.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 Is he your replacement now?

                           NIKI
                 No. Just another team-mate. Keen to
                 make an impression. So let's see where
                 Mr. Reutemann finishes today.

   Laughter.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 James Hunt and McLaren have caught up
                 a lot while you were away.

                           NIKI
                 Yes.
                     (a beat)
                 Is there a question now? Or are you
                 just trying to piss me off?

   Laughter.

                           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
                 You think you can still win?

                           NIKI
                 Of course. I have the better car. I'm
                 the better driver. But he's a clever
                 guy and has used the time well while I
                 was lying half-dead in hospital to win
                 some points..

   Laughter.

                         NIKI
               She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a
               face to drive. Only a right foot."

   Laughter.

                         BRITISH JOURNALIST
               I'm being serious. Do you really think
               your marriage can survive? With the
               way you look now?

   Silence. NIKI squints into the lights..

                         NIKI
               And I'm being serious, too. Which
               asshole said this? Jesus..

   No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..

                         NIKI
               Fuck you. Press conference over.

   NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up...

   JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with
   his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...


168 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME             168

   JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..

                         JAMES
               Hey..!

   The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..

                         JAMES
               I've got something for you on that
               last question...

   The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls
   out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then...

   "WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then

169 EXT. STARTING GRID - MONZA - DAY                               169

   JAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS.
   Commentators talk in different languages.

   Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback.

   NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in
   Italian...

   But NIKI hears nothing. He looks at the steering wheel, the
   shell of the car, the gear stick. And then we see..

   His hands are shaking violently. He's utterly terrified.

   The light turns green. They're off!

   Other cars (including JAMES's), roar forward. But NIKI is
   frozen.


170 EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               170

   NIKI's mind is a mess - terrified - he starts slowly...finding
   his courage..

   COMMENTATORS point out it's madness. It was clearly too soon.
   Ferrari were right to hire a replacement. NIKI is a wreck..

   NIKI suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident...

   NIKI shakes himself out...gradually building up speed -
   ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him...

   NIKI begins to accelerate. Gently at first. Then a bit more.
   Trusting himself. Gaining confidence..

   Blocking out further flashbacks...

   What's this? Maybe there's life in him yet...

   NIKI changes gears smoothly. He begins to overtake. The old
   feelings come back..

   COMMENTATORS begin to get excited. LAUDA has started to
   overtake the back-markers...

   An incredible sequence. As NIKI gains more confidence, more
   speed, and begins to work his way through the field..

   COMMENTATORS now buzzing with excitement. This is incredible,
   as NIKI overtakes first CARLOS REUTEMANN, the driver hired to
   replace him, then others, working his way through the field...


170EINT. JAMES'S CAR - SAME TIME                                 170E

   JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him. Cannot believe his eyes.
   JAMES move to block NIKI's path...

   NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to
   overtake JAMES.

   Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses
   control of the car. He spins out..

   COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT's blown it!
   LAUDA's overtaken him!

   It's a miracle. It defies belief. As NIKI crosses the line....

                 The man was in a coma. His doctors

               What did you expect? That Niki would
               give you the championship lying down?
               Of course not. He's a fighter. He's
               going to come at you with everything
               he's got. But you can do this. As a
               driver, you're his equal - better,
               maybe. And God knows you're quick and
               brave enough. You just..

               Need to find the respect for yourself
               to close out when it really matters.
               You don't much like yourself, James -
               that's the problem, therefore don't
               believe you deserve it.

   A knock at JAMES's hotel room door..

                         JAMES
               I've got to go.

   JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to
   reveal..

   Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart
   blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..

                         STEWARDESS
               Hi. We've come for the party?

                         JAMES
               What party?

                          STEWARDESS
               The party we were told was going on in
               room 2109.

   Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109.

                         JAMES
               Who sent you here?

                 A man. On the phone. He didn't give
                 his name.

                           JAMES
                 This man. Did he speak with an accent?

                           STEWARDESS
                 Yes. German accent.

   JAMES can't believe it. NIKI.

                           JAMES
                 I'm afraid it was a joke..

                           STEWARDESS
                     (liking the look of JAMES)
                 Awwww. Pity.

                           JAMES
                 Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not
                 tonight.

   JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then,
   after a moment...

   He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to
   disappear into the elevator...

                           JAMES

   Uniforms discarded on the floor.

   Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING?
   JAMES leaps out of bed.

   preparation for the race.

   NIKI continues to stare out of the window. They speak in

                           NIKI
                 Can't see the mountain.

                           DUNGL
                 So?

                            NIKI
                 The locals here believe if you can see
                 the mountain in the morning, it brings
                 good luck.

   NIKI's POV: the view. Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.

   DRIVERS and the TEAMS arrive at the race track. JAMES and
   TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL among them...

   SPECTATORS are huddled under umbrellas. TV CREWS struggle to

   An American VOICE comes over the tannoy...

   A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace...

                         AKIYAMA
               One at a time! Gentlemen, please!

   Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see

               You can't send us out in that! It's a

               Niki's talking to them about
               cancelling the race.

   JAMES's POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible,
   remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous
   track conditions...

   JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...

                         JAMES
               I don't want any part of this. I'm not
               going to be responsible for turning
               the room again.

                         CALDWELL
               But you have no option. You HAVE to
               race, James. It's your only shot. If
               you don't, Niki wins..

                         JAMES
               I'm not voting against Niki
               again....or forcing fellow drivers to
               risk their lives. Sorry. World
               Championship or not...

   The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.

                           MAYER
                 The drivers can vote all they like.

   A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel

   The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered

   Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now.
   Realizing what they've got into. Risking their lives.

   Finally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm.

   NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing

   ALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill. Leans towards

   `ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES's visor.

                         CALDWELL
               To let the condensation out.

                         JAMES
               But it will also let the water in.

                         CALDWELL
               Not if you're leading.

   CALDWELL stares at JAMES...

                         CALDWELL
               Trust me. This race is all about the
               start. Whoever's in front will see
               everything. Whoever's second...

   CALDWELL gestures, "Nothing"..

                            CALDWELL
               Good luck.

   NIKI's engine replies with a loud roar. He looks over at
   JAMES. JAMES turns to face NIKI..

   ALL SOUND GOES SILENT...

   ...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another. All around them,
   the world slows down. Comes to a standstill.



                                                       (CONTINUED)

   THEIR EYES MEET...

   A connection between them. Unspoken realization of where they
   have both got to. What this moment means. For them both..

   It's what they have been waiting for. Working towards. All
   this time.

   NIKI raises his hand. In a gesture only JAMES sees. JAMES
   raises his in return. A private salute.

   Chivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies
   become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives.

   THE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED..

   The moment's truce is broken. They return to the task at hand.

   THE FLAG DROPS. THEY'RE OFF.


188 EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY                          188

   HUNT's foot hits the floor. NIKI's foot hits the floor...

   JAMES gets the better start. His car aquaplanes like crazy,
   skating over the water, totally out of control...


189 EXT. FUJI PIT WALL - DAY                                       189

   CALDWELL and MAYER watch from the pit wall...

                           CALDWELL
                 Hold onto it, James..!


190 EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY                          190

   Miraculously JAMES steadies the car...

   The spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist. The other
   cars are wrapped inside it...

   But JAMES has a clear view ahead. He slams his foot down..

                           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
                 It's the perfect start for Hunt!


191 INT. NIKI'S CAR - SAME TIME                                    191

   NIKI can see nothing. Surrounded by spray, water, noise.

   Other cars are spinning all around him. It's chaos. NIKI
   bravely accelerates into blindness...

                           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
                 But Lauda's car is right on his tail!
                 Barely visible in the spray..!


192 EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY                          192

   JAMES goes to a corner, then his car twitches, aquaplanes
   again...badly...almost losing it completely...

                           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
                 Hunt turns too tightly! He almost lost
                 his car right there...!


193 INT. EASTON NESTON - DAY                                       193

   BUBBLES HORSLEY, ALEXANDER HESKETH and a number of the
   characters from the Hesketh Racing days are all watching...

                           HESKETH
                 Concentrate, Superstar!


194 INT. JAMES'S CAR - DAY                                         194

   JAMES struggles to hold onto his car. He steadies it,
   maintaining the lead.


194AINT. NIKI'S CAR - SAME TIME                                  194A

   JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can't
   blink his eyes...it's agony.

   Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he's
   got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...

   For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The
   steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.

   But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his
   scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...

   MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly.
   Kissing him tenderly.

197 EXT. RACE TRACK - JAPAN - SAME TIME                            197

   JAMES continues to race flat out. Engine screaming. Foot to
   the floor. His car aquaplanes again...almost skidding out...


198 INT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - SAME TIME                             198

   SUZY HUNT is watching on television as RICHARD BURTON talks in
   the background on the telephone...

                         SUZY
                   (urging him on)
               Come on, James...


199 EXT. PITS - RACE TRACK - JAPAN - DAY                           199

   A sign is held up as JAMES races. Lap 39.

   But there are problems with the car. One of the tyres...

                         CALDWELL
               God! His front tyre! Look! It's
               completely frayed!

   CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on
   TV. They can see the shaking car..

                         COMMENTATOR
               Hunt's car has problems...it's
               shaking...the Englishman is definitely
               getting slower...


199AEXT. PITS - RACE TRACK - JAPAN - DAY                          199A

   ALASTAIR CALDWELL holds up a sign....

                         CHANGE TYRE

                         COMMENTATOR
               ...with just a few laps to go, McLaren
               are calling for Hunt to come into the
               pits to change tyres...

   JAMES's car roars past the pits, refusing to stop...

                         COMMENTATOR
               But Hunt is refusing! Simply ignoring
               his team's orders...! He's made the
               calculation that he can still hold
               onto the lead...!
                                                                         99

   HESKETH and BUBBLES cover their eyes. Can't look...

                         BUBBLES
               James!! What are you doing???

                         HESKETH
               I can't bear it!


199CINT. JAMES'S CAR - JAPAN GRAND PRIX - SAME TIME              199C

   Suddenly, a Ferrari in JAMES's wing mirror. Unmistakably, even
   in the spray, he can see the distinctive RED HELMET...

   It's NIKI. JAMES's blood runs cold...

                         JAMES
               No! No! NO!!!!

   JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But
   his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...

   ...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...

   JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has
   no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And
   stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him!

   THE CHEQUERED FLAG.

   JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no
   consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned..

   JAMES has lost. Lost everything.


200 EXT. PITS - DAY                                                200

   JAMES's car arrives in the pits. In a fury. At himself. For
   refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool.
   But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging...

                            JAMES
               I'm sorry!

   But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too.
   The world's media descends on JAMES...

                         MAYER
               Sorry?? What are you talking about??
               You did it!

                             MAYER
                 You WON!!

                           JAMES
                 Rubbish!! What about Niki?? He
                 overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari
                 with a red helmet..

                           MAYER
                 That wasn't Niki. That was Regazzoni.

                             JAMES
                 What???

                           MAYER
                 Niki withdrew. Said it was too
                 dangerous, refused to drive!!
                     (gestures)
                 You're Champion of the World, kiddo!

   TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his
   car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'.

   JAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness.

   A television plays in the Emergency Ward of the hospital.
   NURSIE catches sight of the victory, patients cheering and
   applauding...

   NURSIE allows herself a smile.

   glamorously, smiles.

                           SUZY
                 Well done, James..

   Then turns the TV off. And follows BURTON out.
                                                                       101

201 EXT. FUJI PADDOCK - HELICOPTER - SAME TIME                     201

   Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning.
   JAMES looks over to see...

   NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT. NIKI, now the
   ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES
   surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc

                         MARLENE
               Are you OK?

   NIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers.

                         NIKI
               Fine. It's just one race.

   The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...


202 EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME                                       202

   JAMES watches as the helicopter carrying NIKI flies away, then
   turns to see...

   ...the world's press begins to descend on him, and the biggest
   party of JAMES HUNT's life is about to begin..

   In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving
   interviews again. They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI
   got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came
   9th...

   And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the
   snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.


203 A QUICKFIRE MONTAGE                                            203

   Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative
   endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards.

   JAMES's world championship victory has made him a rich man.
   His movie star looks make him an international STAR and
   marketing man's dream.

   Girls, more girls, and even more girls.

204 EXT. RUNWAY - DAY                                               204

   We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.

   CAPTION: "THREE MONTHS LATER"

   A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.

   A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy
   FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...

   They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet,
   passing other jets, when JAMES stops.

   He's seen something that has caught his eye.

   JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and
   walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...

                           JAMES
                 I heard you were spending more and
                 more time in one of these...

   A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's
   NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a
   painful sight...

                           NIKI
                 Do you fly?

                           JAMES
                 No.

                           NIKI
                 You should try it. If something goes
                 wrong up there, you're on the edge,
                 but have to stay within the rules.
                 Stick to regulations. Suppress the
                 ego. It's good discipline for the
                 racing.

                           JAMES
                 And there I was thinking you were
                 about to wax lyrical about the romance
                 of flight. I should have known better.

                           NIKI
                 What brings you here?

   JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..

                           JAMES
                 A friend's wedding. At least I think
                 it was a wedding. Might have been a
                 birthday. All a bit of a blur. How
                 about you? Been at Fiorano?

                           NIKI
                 Pre-season testing.

                           JAMES
                 Already? In February? You're
                 relentless.

                              NIKI
                 Thank you.

                           JAMES
                 I'm not sure I meant it as a
                 compliment.

                           NIKI
                 But it is one. Relentlessness is good.
                 Means you're a fighter. That you never
                 give up. Behind my back I know some of
                 you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I
                 look like one. It's meant as an
                 insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are
                 ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But
                 they're intelligent. With a strong
                 survival instinct.

   JAMES can't help smiling. That's NIKI.

                           NIKI
                 So when do you start testing? Next
                 week?

                           JAMES
                 Are you mad? I didn't just win the
                 biggest thing of my life so I could
                 get right back to work.

                           NIKI
                 Why? You need to. To prove to all the
                 people who will always say you only
                 won it because...

                           JAMES
                 Because what...? Because of your
                 accident? Is that other people, Niki?
                 Or you? I won. On the all important
                 day when it came down to it, we raced
                 on equal terms in equally good cars.

                         JAMES (contíd)
               You bottled and I had the guts to see
               it through.

                         NIKI
               It's true. You won that race. And
               believe me if I had to lose that title
               to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But
               that doesn't change the fact you have
               to win again.

                         JAMES
               Why?

                         NIKI
               Because that's what it means to be a
               winner, no? It's a permanent
               condition. Never stops or goes away.
               It stays with you always.

                         JAMES
               That's winning? Sounds like losing to
               me. Some of life needs to be for
               pleasure, Niki. What's the use of
               having a million cups and medals if
               you never have any fun? How is that
               winning?

   The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"

                         NIKI
               You're right. I could learn from you.
               In hospital the toughest part of my
               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
               While doing it, I was watching
               television...you winning all those
               races...and I was cursing you.. "That
               bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
               that guy." one day the doctor said,
               "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
               to have been given an enemy in life.
               It can be a blessing, too." I said,
               "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
               wise man gets more from his enemies
               than a fool from his friends." And you
               know, he's right. Look at us. We were
               a pair of kids when we first met.
               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
               nowhere. Now we're both Champions of
               the world. Not bad.

                         JAMES
               No, not bad.

                         NIKI
               So don't let me down now. I need you
               busting my balls. Get back to work.

                         JAMES
               I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy
               myself first. And so should you. You
               think you can?

   NIKI stares. A blank look..

                         JAMES
               See you on race day, Champ.

                         NIKI
               You will. Champ.

   JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his
   laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his
   eyes.

   Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.

               CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The
               THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The
               power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back
               the hair and rattles the ears.

               FADE IN:

               The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.
               Huge fifteen inch guns.

               SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT

               Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from
               German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the
               beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers,
               pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

                         At the far end of the beach, a ninety-
                         foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers.
                         Ringed by fortified machine gun nests.
                         A clear line-of-fire down the entire
                         beach.

                                     TEN LANDING CRAFT
                         Make their way toward the base of
                         the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of
                         explosions.

                         STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows
                         through the waves.

               THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN

               Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough.
               Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them.

               A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT

               A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

               The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.
               FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into
               the bow.

               THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS

               BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes
               the controls.

                                     A YOUNG SOLDIER
                         His face covered with the remains of
                         the motorman.  Starts to lose it.
                         Begins to shudder and weep.  His
                         name is DeLancey.

               THE BOYS AROUND HIM

               Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects
               them.  It starts to spread.

                                     A FIGURE
                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself
                         in front of DeLancey.

               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
               helmet and lights the cigar.

               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
               terrified.

               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

               Delancey Oh, Jesus...

               Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
               left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for
               those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
               cheek and moves on to the bow.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL
                         IN FRONT OF THEM.

               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND

               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none
               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it
               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
               eyes back to the objective.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

               The six surviving boats alongside.

               EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

               From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

               THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN

               A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.  A dozen
               men are INSTANTLY KILLED.  Among them, DeLancey.

                                     MILLER
                         Somehow survives.  Jumps into the
                         breakers.

                                     MILLER
                         MOVE, GODDAMN IT!  GO!  GO!  GO!

                                     EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE
                         THE GERMANS On the edge of the cliff.
                         Rain down MACHINE GUN FIRE and
                         GRENADES.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Struggle through the surf.  FIRING
                         up as best they can.  Making for the
                         base of the cliffs.

               INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,

               EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE

                                     MILLER
                         Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS.
                         Uses hand signals and curt orders.

                                     MILLER
                         THERE!  THERE!  HOOKS THERE!  FIRE
                         SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!

                                     THE MEN
                         Obey instantly.  Set the grappling
                         hooks.  Take position.  Return fire.

               THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

               Drown out most voices.  Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED
               AND DYING.

                                     THE MEN
                         Know what they have to do.  Start up
                         the ropes.  Into the teeth of the
                         German defenders.

                                     MILLER
                         Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine
                         gun.  Starts climbing with the first
                         group.

                                     THE CLIFF FACE
                         The Americans swarm up the ropes.
                         Taking turns firing up at the Germans.

               MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

               A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.
               Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs
               on.

                                     HALF-WAY
                         An American private is HIT.  FALLS,
                         taking two others with him.  All
                         three land on the rocks below.
                         Another way to die.

                                     NEAR THE TOP
                         Less steep.  They leave the ropes.
                         Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.

                                     MILLER
                         Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.
                         Others bottleneck behind them.  Miller
                         scans the route and the defenders.

               Sees an open gap.  Deadly.  Beyond is a protective overhang.
               With a clear line to the top.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the route.

               Miller motions to six men huddled near him.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Take an instant to get ready.  Then
                         SCRAMBLE into the gap.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               Do their best to cover them.  POUR FIRE up at the Germans.
               Bad angle.  No Germans are hit.

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN
                         FIRE.  All KILLED.  They fall to the
                         rocks below.

               SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and
               best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.

               Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         It's the only way.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns to the next half-dozen men.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU'RE NEXT!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Move to the head of the gap.  Miller
                         moves for a better angle against the
                         machine guns.  Calls to JACKSON, a
                         tall, gangly Southern country boy,
                         sharp-shooter.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,
                         WILL YOU?

                                     JACKSON
                              (heavy Southern accent)
                         You betcha, Captain.

               Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.
               Turns to the second six.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Take deep breaths.  Head into the
                         gap.

               MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE

               JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.
               SARGE gets one.  Not enough.

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are
                         KILLED.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns, looking for the next six.
                         His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN
                         who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.
                         Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy Brooklyn accent)
                         Captain, can I put in for a transfer?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start
                         the paperwork.

                                     THE THIRD SIX
                         Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller
                         exchange a look.  They both see the
                         madness of what they're doing.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               OPEN UP on the Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     SARGE
                         Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.
                         Scrambles into the gap.  The other
                         five right behind.

                                     IN THE GAP
                         BULLETS EVERYWHERE.

               Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce
               down.  EXPLODE below.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller
               sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.

               A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING
               TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

               SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He
               swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward
               Miller.

               A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant
               from death.

               SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE

               Under the overhang to safety.

               MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL
               IS BLOWN OFF.

               UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead!

               Sarge hollers back to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO
                         THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!

                                     MILLER
                         I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

               Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.
               HIT more Germans.

               SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop
               near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw
               long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.

               THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.

               Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.

                                     MILLER
                         Crosses the gap.  His men follow.

                                     AT THE CREST
                         The Americans swarm over the top.
                         FIRING.

               TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.

               Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans
               are CUT DOWN.

               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man
               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel
               charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade, your turn.

               Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.

               Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to
               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.
               Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED
               EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.

                                     MILLER AND SARGE
                         Survey the field.

                                     SARGE
                         What the hell were you doing?  Drawing
                         fire!

                                     MILLER
                         Worked, didn't it?

                                     SARGE
                         You tryin' to get yourself killed?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need to, the Krauts go that
                         covered.

               Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff
               at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering
               the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.

               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves
               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German
               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE
               surround him.  DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of
               CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands
               in the heart of Washington, D.C.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:
                         WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.

               JUNE 8, 1944

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,
               quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.

                                     A CLERK
                         Older than the others, sad-eyed,
                         adds a sheet of paper to a large
                         pile in his out-box.

                                     CLOSE SHOT
                         An outgoing telegram.  It reads:
                         "We regret to inform you...killed in
                         action...heroic service..."  This is
                         the paperwork of death.

                                     THE CLERK
                         Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds
                         something troubling.  Quickly shuffles
                         through some other papers.  Finds
                         what he's looking for.  Rises from
                         his desk and hurries out of the
                         office.

               INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Seen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG
               LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.
               He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the
               office with the clerk on his heels.

               INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks
               to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
               bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the
               papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.

               INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The
               walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
               ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly
               hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff
               officer, walks in.

               Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
               about.

               One-armed colonel Yes?

               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha
               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother
               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this
               morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
               this afternoon.

               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear
               and freeze.

               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The
               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
               Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.

               One-armed colonel Is he alive?

               Young captain We don't know.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.

               One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his
               heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.

               EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY

               A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising
               behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.

               EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY

               A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as
               far as the eye can see.

                                     IN THE YARD
                         A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed
                         to the barn over a dirt basketball
                         court.

                                     A PORCH SWING
                         Sits empty.  Moves slightly.

               ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR

               Four American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service.

                                     MARGARET RYAN
                         Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face
                         shows the lines of a life of hard
                         work and mother hood.  A good woman.

               She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the
               fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind
               the black car.

               She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her
               house.  She starts to grow uneasy.

               As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She
               reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

               The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,
               one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.

               INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY

               Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
               GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
               his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half-
               a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
               the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the
               file.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                              (softly)
                         Goddamn it.

               One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company
               in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan
               brothers died on the Juneau.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Any contact with the fourth brother,
                         James?

               One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles
               inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines.

               General Marshall hardens.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Well, if he's alive, we're going to
                         send someone to get him the hell out
                         of there.  That's just what the
                         General's staff wanted to hear.

               EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY

               NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.
               Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force
               of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the
               craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in
               the distance.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:

                                     MILLER
                         Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through
                         the fire and dives into a sludge-
                         filled crater.  He surfaces, sees
                         Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a
                         horrific smell.  Their conversation
                         is repeatedly broken by FIRING And
                         DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we
                         swimming in?

                                     REIBEN
                         Shit, sir.

                                     SARGE
                         Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're
                         in a cranberry bog.

                                     REIBEN
                         Out of the frying pan, into the
                         fucking latrine.

                                     MILLER
                         Look at the bright side, the Krauts
                         sure as hell don't want to advance
                         and hold this cesspool.

               Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.

                                     MILLER
                         Get Fire Control, we need some
                         artillery...

               Radioman Trying, sir.

               MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, what if they send some other
                         company into Caen ahead of us while
                         we're pinned down here?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, we're the only Rangers
                         this side of the continent, we've
                         got to be first into Caen.

                                     SARGE
                         Who cares?

                                     REIBEN
                         I care.  Don't you know what Caen's
                         famous for, Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         Frogs?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie.

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah?  So?

               THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge
               and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German
               positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck
               down again.

                                     REIBEN
                         So, you ever heard of employee
                         discounts?  My uncle sells shoes,
                         gets twenty-five percent off
                         everything in the line, got a closet
                         filled with the best looking shoes
                         you ever seen.

               MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

                                     REIBEN
                         Just picture some French number been
                         spending all day, every day, making
                         cream-colored, shear-body negligees
                         with gentle-lift silk cups and
                         gathered empire waists, what the
                         hell you think she wears at night?

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, how the hell do you know so
                         much about lingerie?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's
                         got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in
                         it, from the time I could crawl, we
                         carry Caen lingerie, it's the best
                         there is, it's all I been thinking
                         about since the invasion.

               Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS
               HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         There's a war on, good chance they're
                         not still making lingerie in Caen.

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Captain, they'll always make
                         lingerie, it's one of the three basic
                         needs of man -- food, shelter, silk
                         teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

                                     REIBEN
                         Happy to, sir.

               Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at
               H.Q., right away.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe the war's over.

               A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops
               falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben
               looks dubiously at Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I don't think so, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Radioman)
                         Stay at it until you get fire control.
                              (to Sarge)
                         Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles
               out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.

               EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY

               Chaos.  Under fire.  INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN
               SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Runs over the broken ground and makes
                         it to the sandbagged H.Q.  He stumbles
                         down the make-shift stairs.

               INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY

               Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which
               continue through the scene.  Miller salutes a Major.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.

               Major Go on in.

               Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a
               dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.
               Very busy.  A field map dominates the center of the small
               space.

               The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him
               respectfully.  He's clearly someone special.

               COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.
               He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of
               the storm.  He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...I understand your problem, but if
                         we don't get those tanks off-loaded
                         by 0600, we're going to have an entire
                         division up at Caen with its ass
                         hanging out of its pants...

               A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of
               paper.

               Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.

                                     MILLER
                         My what?

               Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-
               action.

               Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.

                                     MILLER
                         Find a chaplain.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...alright, let me know when.

               Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Have the Second and Third Regiments
                         hold at St. Michel until we get those
                         tanks.  Aide Yes, sir.

               Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Report.

                                     MILLER
                         Sector four is secured, we put out
                         the last three German one-fifty-fives,
                         found them about two miles in from
                         Ponte du Hoc.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Resistance?

                                     MILLER
                         A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,
                         we took twenty-three prisoners, turned
                         them over to intelligence.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Casualties?

                                     MILLER
                         Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

               An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.

                                     MILLER
                         They didn't want to give up those
                         one-fifty-fives, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         It was a hard assignment, that's why
                         you got it.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Where are your men now?

                                     MILLER
                         Pinned down, a mile east of here,
                         waiting for some help from the navy
                         guns.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         I'm sending Simpson to take over for
                         you, the division is going to Caen,
                         you're not coming with us, I have
                         something else for you.

                                     MILLER
                         Sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         There's a Private James Ryan who
                         parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
                         First near Ramelle.  I want you to
                         take a squad up there.  If he's alive,
                         bring him back to the beach for
                         debarkation.  Take whoever you need,
                         you've got your pick of the company.

                                     MILLER
                         A private, sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         He's the last of four brothers, the
                         other three were killed in action.
                         This is straight from the Chief of
                         Staff.

                                     MILLER
                         But, sir...I...I...

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Spit it out, Captain.

               MILLER HESITATES, THEN:

                                     MILLER
                         Respectfully, sir, sending men all
                         the way up to Ramelle to save one
                         private doesn't make a fucking,
                         goddamned bit of sense.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel
               Anderson glares at Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         You think just because you hold the
                         Congressional Medal of Honor, you
                         can say any damn thing you please to
                         your superior officers?

               Miller considers the question, then smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir, more or less.

               Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
               off, then he smiles, too.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Alright, I'll give you that.
                         Continue.

                                     MILLER
                         The numbers don't make sense, sir.
                         His brothers are dead, that's too
                         bad, but they're out of the equation.
                         Sending men up there is bleeding
                         heart crapola from three thousand
                         miles away.  One private is simply
                         not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson
                         This one is.  He's worth a lot more
                         than that.  Which is why I'm sending
                         you, you're the best field officer
                         there is.

               Miller Shrugs.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?
                         Fine officer, regular church goer,
                         writes poetry, he might like a mission
                         like this.
                              (beat)
                         And he's taller than me.

               Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's
               time to get back to business.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         That's enough, Captain, you have
                         your orders.  Major Thomas will fill
                         you in.

               Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Good luck, John.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank you, sir.

               Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
               Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
               the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they
               go back to work.

               EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY

               A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the
               deck of the enormous ship.

               EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY

               HUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German
               position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.

                                     IN THE CRATERS
                         Miller's Ranger company ducks and
                         covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The
                         Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging
                         from crater to crater, advancing
                         against the remaining Germans who
                         return SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs and dives into a crater
                         with Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge,
                         we're heading out.

                                     SARGE
                         Caen?

                                     MILLER
                         I wish.  You and I are taking a squad
                         up to Ramelle on a public relations
                         mission.

                                     SARGE
                         You?  Leading a squad?

                                     MILLER
                         Some private up there lost three
                         brothers, got a ticket home.

                                     SARGE
                         What about the company?

                                     MILLER
                         Simpson.

                                     SARGE
                         Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking
                         pogo stick!

                                     MILLER
                         I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with
                         his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.

                                     SARGE
                         Beasley's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade.  Translators?

                                     SARGE
                         Fresh out.

                                     MILLER
                         What about Talbot?

                                     SARGE
                         Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn,
                         I'll go see if I can find another
                         one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and
                         Wade, meet me at transport.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the
               crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.

               EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY

               Just in from the beaches.  DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS.
               Nothing close.  Dust.  Confusion.  Vehicles of every sort
               moving out.  Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks.  In the middle
               of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-
               shift desk made out of crate.  He yells at a PRIVATE.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT
                         OF THERE!

               Private They're blocked in!

                                     SERGEANT
                         THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!

               SARGE< REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE

               Wait nearby.  Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.
               The others are relaxed.

                                     MILLER
                         Strides through the chaos, avoiding
                         the passing vehicles.  He sees his
                         men and walks toward them.  Reiben
                         hurries up to Miller, pleading.

                                     REIBEN
                         Please, sir, you can't take me to
                         Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir,
                         please, I told you, they make Caen
                         lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's
                         the best there is, it's...oh, please,
                         sir...

                                     MILLER
                         Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're
                         the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (desperate)
                         No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or
                         what about Faulkner?  Or that little
                         guy with the glasses?

                                     MILLER
                         Trust me, you're the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (whimpering)
                         But, sir...

               Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides
               off toward the Supply Sergeant's table.  Sarge falls in next
               to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         You get a translator, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I've got a line on one.

                                     TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE
                         Chaos.  Vehicles THUNDERING by.  The
                         Supply Sergeant juggles runners and
                         paperwork.  Miller steps up to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, I need a truck.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how
                         'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top,
                         red with black interior.

                                     MILLER
                         White-walls?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         No white-walls, sir, there's a war
                         on.
                              (to the Private)
                         NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER
                         THERE!
                              (to Miller)
                         I can't help you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         A half-track, anything.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir.  Division is using
                         everything on wheels to get up to
                         Caen.
                              (notices Miller's
                              shoulder patch)
                         How come you guys aren't going?

               Miller ignores the question.  He spies a jeep.

                                     MILLER
                         How about that jeep?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog
                         told me if anyone breathes on it,
                         I'll get busted and if anyone so
                         much as touches it with their little
                         finger, I'll get court marshaled.
                         If you were to take it, they'd shoot
                         me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk
                         all the way up to Ramelle?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         What's at Ramelle beside a lot of
                         Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going
                         home, if he's alive.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Senator's son?

                                     MILLER
                         No, three brothers of his were killed
                         in action.  Command wants him out of
                         there.

               The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Damn...I got a couple brothers...

               Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly.  The Supply
               Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY

               Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep.
               Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam
               of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson
               and Wade are crammed in the back.

               The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL
               GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his
               huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.

                                     GENERAL GAVIN
                         SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY
                         GODDAMNED JEEP!?

               The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns
               to take his lumps.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American
               staging area.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to make one stop.

               Miller points the way for Sarge.

               EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly
               white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles
               and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.
               SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out.

                                     MILLER
                         Wait here.

               He strides into the tent.

               INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
               nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and
               gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,
               detailed work.

               One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
               patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
               glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
               EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
               Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

               Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

               Upham Sir, I'm Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         I understand you speak French and
                         German.

               Upham Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have an accent?

               Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a
               touch of the Bavarian.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, you've been re-assigned to me,
                         we're going to Ramelle.

               Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

               Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.

                                     MILLER
                         That's my understanding.

               Upham Lots of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have a problem with that,
                         Corporal?

               Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I
               translate.

                                     MILLER
                         I need a translator, all mine have
                         been killed.

               Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll come back to you.  Get your
                         gear.

               Upham hesitates.

               Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?

               Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

               Upham I'm writing a book and I...

               Miller's expression gives him his answer.

               Upham Uh, how about a pencil?

                                     MILLER
                         A small one.

               Miller shoos him off.

                                     MILLER
                         Go, go...

               Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
               others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA
               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
               in military history.

               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered
               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles
               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-
               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships
               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of
               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some
               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny
               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day
               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are
               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
               equipment, bodies.

               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine
               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly
               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in
               the back of the jeep.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, can I ask you a question?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         Where are you planning on putting
                         Private Ryan, sir?

               Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         It's just that it's kind of crowded
                         back here, I was wondering if you're
                         expecting to have more room on the
                         way back?

               Miller points out a turn to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Left.

               Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets
               it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now we've got a straight shot, due
                         north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,
                         two villages between here and there,
                         St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take
                         the jeep as far as we can, then go
                         on on foot.

                                     SARGE
                         We in radio contact with anybody up
                         there?

                                     MILLER
                         Somebody put the wrong crystals in
                         every one of the Hundred-and-First's
                         radios the night before the drop,
                         not one of them works.  We're going
                         in blind.

                                     REIBEN
                         I usually like surprises.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we likely to run into?

                                     MILLER
                         A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut
                         divisions, no fronts, no lines, the
                         drops were completely fouled up,
                         we've got little pockets of
                         paratroopers all over the place,
                         trying to hang on.  Command says we
                         hold St. Mere, but north of that,
                         it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's
                         where he's supposed to be, he's more
                         than likely dead.

                                     SARGE
                         Hell of a mission.

                                     MILLER
                         Yep, hell of a mission.

               IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP

               Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring
               at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful
               smile.

               Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?

               Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an
               insect.

               Upham I'm Upham.

               (pointing at his corporal's stripes)

               Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.
               Their jaws drop.

                                     REIBEN
                              (to Wade)
                         You want to shoot him, or should I?

               Wade It's not my turn.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,
                         Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

               Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.

               Upham Miller?

                                     MILLER
                         I don't want anybody to shoot him,
                         that's an order.  He speaks French
                         and his German has a touch of the
                         Bavarian.

               Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?

               Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         ...who won the Congressional Medal
                         of Hon...?

               Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
               of Miller's men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
               faced.

               No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as
               if it had never happened.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony
                         of this mission is fucking killing
                         me.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, how so?

                                     REIBEN
                         I should be on my way to Caen, sir.
                         It's like Beethoven, the guy's one
                         of the greatest composers ever lived
                         and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,
                         who'd he piss off?  And here I am,
                         the Beethoven of ladies foundation
                         garments, one step away from Caen,
                         the center of the known lingerie
                         universe and instead, I'm going to
                         Ramelle to save some fucking private
                         who's probably already dead.

                                     MILLER
                         There's to be a bright side, look
                         for it.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous
                         for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company
                         is going to Caen and we're going to
                         the goddamned cheese capital of
                         France.  There is no bright side.

                                     MILLER
                         There's always a bright side.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm listening, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Well, I, for one, like cheese.

               Wade pipes up cheerfully.

               Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's
               something up there for me to blow up.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, you're a happy idiot.

               THEY ROUND A TURN

               SKID TO A STOP AT A:

               BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES

               A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.

                                     MILLER
                         How's the road up to St. Mere?

               Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding
               somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.

                                     MILLER
                         Anybody getting through?

               Lieutenant The lucky ones.

               Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying
               gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
               down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.
               They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct
               hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.

               AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS

               On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of
               a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham
               grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's
               reaction.

                                     IN THE BACK
                         The men bounce up and down like
                         stuffed animals, doing their best to
                         not be thrown out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, this is better than Coney
                         Island!

                                     A HUGE BUMP
                         Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
                         down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN
                         PAIN.

                                     MILLER
                         Just trying to make room for Ryan.

               Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his
               shovel from under his bruised ass.

               THEY ROUND A BEND

               See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,
               obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

               Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER

                                     MILLER
                              (sweetly)
                         Sarge?

               SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.

                                     ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
                         Thirty yards ahead of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Directs Sarge off the road.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got the road zeroed.

                                     SARGE
                         Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep
                         off the road.

                                     THE JEEP BOUNCES
                         Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing
                         everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.
                         The jeep tears along the rutted field.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Just behind them.

                                     SARGE DRIVES MADLY
                         Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid
                         the biggest ruts and bumps.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Close on their side.  Showers them
                         with debris.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus Christ!

               MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN

               Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got a hell of a spotter
                         somewhere.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED
                         WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH
                         the smoke.

                                     MILLER
                         S-curves, Sarge.

                                     SARGE
                         Turns shallow curves without slowing
                         down.

               SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER

               Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned
               earth.  STOPS SHORT.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON

               THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt.

                                     SARGE AND MILLER
                         Hang on.  Stay in the jeep but are
                         battered.  All stunned.  MILLER Is
                         first to regain his bearings.  Jumps
                         up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.
                         Deep in the soft dirt.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge!  Reverse!

               Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
               The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
               Yells to the others.

                                     MILLER
                         COME ON!  YOU WANNA WALK?

                                     STILL DAZED
                         Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw
                         their heads back on.  Shoulder into
                         the jeep.  Push for all they're worth.
                         The WHEELS STILL SPIN.

               ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT

                                     MILLER IGNORES IT
                         He's the only one who does.

                                     SARGE
                         Captain, they got us zeroed.

               Upham is very nervous.

                                     UPHAM
                         That's bracketing, right?

               They all ignore him.

                                     UPHAM
                         I know about bracketing.  I read
                         about it.  The next one is going to
                         land right on us.

                                     MILLER
                         FORWARD!  FORWARD!
                              (beat)
                         NOW REVERSE!

               Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE.  Rocks it.  SLAMS IT BACK
               INTO FORWARD.  Makes progress.

               ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.  WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     MILLER
                         PUSH!

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     THE TIRES SCREAM
                         A bit more progress.  It's almost
                         out.

               THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS

               Knowing the shell is coming any second.  Upham is beside
               himself.

                                     SARGE
                              (sweetly)
                         Oh, Captain...

                                     ONE MORE PUSH
                         The jeep rocks back in, deeper.

                                     MILLER
                         SHIT!

               THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE MEN
                         Instantly take off.  Away from the
                         jeep.  As fast as they can.

               THE SHELL SCREAMS IN

               The men hit the dirt.

                                     DIRECT HIT
                         OBLITERATING THE JEEP

                                     THE MEN
                         Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.
                         STUNNED by the concussion.  SHOWERED
                         with dirt, rock and debris.

                                     MILLER
                         Is first up.  Sarge and the men
                         struggle to their feet.  Hear MORE
                         INCOMING.  Miller grabs Upham by the
                         collar and pulls him up.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE COME THE MORTARS!

               THEY ALL TAKE OFF

               Running as fast as they can.

               THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN

               The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.  But
               there must be a dozen mortars firing.  The shells are almost
               constant.

                                     THE FIELD
                         The six Americans run madly, in zig-
                         zag patterns through the gauntlet of
                         MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  BOOM

                                     RUNNING, STUMBLING
                         BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

               UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

               Miller yanks him up.  Half-drags him to the edge of the field.

               THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

               Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards
               in.

                                     THE EXPLOSIONS STOP
                         THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling
                         to catch their breath. Check their
                         body parts.  Everything's there.
                         They have their weapons, most of
                         their gear.

               Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is
               nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         General Gavin is going to be very
                         irritated at you, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands on the edge of the woods,
                         almost in a trance.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

                                     SARGE
                         Sssssh!

               Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from
               position to position.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, maps.

               Sarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent,
               frozen in place.

                                     MILLER
                         Two eighty-eights, just under two-
                         and-a-half miles, that way, vector
                         from the jeep, through those two
                         trees at the base of the hill.  The
                         mortars came from behind that rise,
                         there, four of them.

               Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out
               of it.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade, the radio.

               Wade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed.

                                     UPHAM
                         You can tell all that, just by the
                         sound, sire?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not all.  There were nine
                         gunners on the eighty-eights, one
                         had a broken heel on his boot, two
                         had bratwurst for supper last night,
                         one of them is named Fritz, the other,
                         Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard
                         to tell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Corporal, you have just seen one of
                         Captain Miller's many God-given
                         talents.  If, by some miracle, you
                         survive, you will witness many more
                         of them.

               Sarge finished vectoring.

                                     SARGE
                         Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care
                         of those eighty-eights?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not what we're here for.

                                     WADE
                              (re. radio)
                         I've got command, Captain.

               Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                              (into radio)
                         This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,
                         sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-
                         three by baker-three.  Two eighty-
                         eights.  Tell our boys to come in
                         low from the east in case the Krauts
                         have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over.

               A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade
               packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir,
               wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.

                                     SARGE
                         He's right, Captain, it might be
                         kind of dangerous for those flyboys.

                                     MILLER
                         Tell that to Private James Ryan.
                         We've got our orders.  Let's go.

               Miller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest
               of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails,
               amazed at Miller.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Miller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in
               alongside Reiben.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     REIBEN
                         Get lost.

               Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     JACKSON
                         You writin' a book or somethin'?

                                     UPHAM
                         As a matter of fact, I am.

                                     JACKSON
                         Figured.

               Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.

                                     WADE
                         I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E,
                         I'm small but wiry, with piercing,
                         steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn
                         but handsome face, I'm from Colorado,
                         my father's a mining engineer, don't
                         you take notes?

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         Demolition, right?

                                     WADE
                         Since I was nine years old.  They
                         got a lot of explosives around mines.
                         Me and my little brother could get
                         into any warehouse you ever saw.
                         Damn, we had fun!

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork,
                         Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher.
                         Him and his two brothers got a
                         ministry, The Blessed Church of the
                         Wandering Gospel.

                                     UPHAM
                         In West Fork?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the back of a nineteen and thirty-
                         one stretch Hudson with a big ole'
                         trailer.

                                     UPHAM
                         No kidding.

                                     JACKSON
                         I don't make jokes about things of,
                         or related to, the preaching of the
                         Holy Gospel, including the ministerial
                         calling of my family.

                                     UPHAM
                         So they travel around from place to
                         place and preach?

                                     JACKSON
                         We got us a tent, forty-two feet
                         across, eighteen feet at center,
                         hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.
                         Circuit's eleven towns, covers all

                         What about the Captain?  Where's he
                         from?

               They all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot.

                                     JACKSON
                         You figure that out, you got yourself
                         one nice prize.

                         five bucks gets you in, whoever

                         the Congressional Medal of Honor, he
                         saved a dozen men.

                         Somebody must know where he's from,
                         what he did for a living.

                         The Captain prefers not to discuss
                         certain aspects of his life, in
                         particular, everything up to and
                         including his enlistment in the United

                         I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm
                         closer to him that I am to my own
                         brother but I don't even know what
                         state he's from.  Somewhere in the
                         Northeast as near as I can figure.
                         I don't even have a clue what he did
                         for a living as civilian.

               Reiben shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         No one's gonna win the money for the
                         simple reason that the Captain never
                         was a civilian.  They assembled him
                         at O.C.S. out of spare body parts
                         from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a
                         fact.

                                     JACKSON
                              (defensively)
                         You got somethin' against the Cap'n?

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, no.  I think he's the best
                         officer in the whole goddamned army,
                         bar none.

               They all nod in assent, no argument there.

                                     JACKSON
                         You got that right.

               Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham
               watches Miller, with even more curiosity.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a
               country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the
               brush.  Miller walks tall now.

                                     JACKSON
                         Captain, my feet are most
                         uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we
                         was gonna have to walk all the way
                         to Ramelle, I never would 'a
                         volunteered for this here mission.

                                     MILLER
                         You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                         I most likely would have, sir, had I
                         been given the opportunity.

                         If we find Ryan and he's still alive,
                         that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry
                         this goddamned B.A.R. back to the
                         beach for me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Army life is too dang easy, my feet
                         have gone soft.  Back home, we go
                         out squirrel huntin', I walk forever
                         and a day and then some, don't even
                         raise a blister.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what a B.A.R. weighs?
                         Nineteen and a half pounds, not
                         counting ammo.
                              (re. ammo bandoleers)
                         And you think these things are
                         comfortable?  They may look good but
                         they weigh twelve pounds each, that's
                         thirty-six pounds, right there.

                                     WADE
                         So what?  I've got three satchel
                         charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen-
                         and-a-half pineapples, and all my
                         regular gear.  You don't hear me
                         complaining.

                                     REIBEN
                         That's because, as I have pointed
                         out on numerous occasions, you are a
                         happy idiot.

                         No, I just happen to take the
                         Captain's advice and look at the
                         bright side of things.

                                     UPHAM
                         How do you do it?

                                     WADE
                         It's easy, it runs in my family,
                         take my grandfather, for example...

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to
                         that grandfather thing again.

                                     WADE
                         As I was saying, before I was so
                         rudely interrupted, my grandfather
                         got old, as grandfathers tend to do.
                         He needed someone to take care of
                         him.  We move around all the time,
                         going from one mine to another, so
                         we had to put him in a home.  Nice
                         enough place but kind of depressing.
                         But not for Granddad.  He just
                         convinced himself he was on a cruise
                         ship, going to Tahiti, he had his
                         own cabin, first class, with room
                         service.  It just so happened that
                         the weather was always lousy, so he
                         never bothered to go up on deck.
                         Happiest guy you ever saw until the
                         day he died.

                                     UPHAM
                         You think he really believed it?

                         Who knows?  It worked.

                         Fine, you convince yourself you got
                         a pack full of feathers and goddamned
                         Private James Ryan can carry my

                         Reiben, you can be very unpleasant
                         to be around sometimes.

                                     REIBEN
                         You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I
                         can do much better than this.

                         Look at Upham, you don't hear him
                         complaining.

               Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a
               shot.

                                     UPHAM
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I was
                         just thinking...

               The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         That I'm so fucking tired of this
                         goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand
                         dollars to see that bastard Ryan
                         crawl on his belly over an acre of
                         broken glass to hear my great-aunt
                         Martha fart through a field-phone.

               The men are stunned.

                                     REIBEN
                         Jesus Christ, he's a natural!

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, are you sure you've never
                         been in combat?

               Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain
               I'd remember.

               Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.

                                     MILLER
                         He's good.

               They walk on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.

               Miller smiles, situation normal.

               EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
               battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR
               EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers
               crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.

               Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a
               couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across
               and disappear into the remains of a building.

               Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
               corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread
               out down the block behind him.

               Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental
               picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
               an alley across the street and down the block.  They are
               CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.

               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET
               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.

               Miller motions Jackson across first.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay low.

               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,
               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and
               makes it to the cover of the far side.

                                     JACKSON
                         Dang!  That was close!

               Miller nods to Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Your turn.

               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him
               very gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple
                         times, you'll be alright.

               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for
                         you.
                              (sternly)
                         But if I do, you goddamned well better
                         go.

               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.

               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks to Upham

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

               Upham nods, still terrified.

               MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN

               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

                                     MILLER
                         Go.

               Upham runs.

               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.

               He doesn't budge.

               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.

               REIBEN watches Upham run.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, that guy can move.

               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to
               the far side.

               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't
               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.
               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.

                                     SARGE
                              (under his breath so
                              only Miller can hear)
                         Damn fool.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, he's fast!

                                     MILLER
                              (glances at Sarge,
                              speaks to Reiben)
                         Glad of it.

                                     UPHAM
                         On the other side of the street,
                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
                         Upham is a bit in shock, less from
                         the nearness of the bullets than
                         from what Miller just did for him.

                                     MILLER
                         DASHES across the street.

               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches
               behind him.

               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Bring 'em over.

               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         One at a time.

                                     MILLER
                         Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-
                         runs down the block.  He passes a:

                                     BOMBED OUT BUILDING
                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen
                         dead American soldiers lined up on
                         the ground.  The battered, bloody
                         bodies, only partially covered by
                         ponchos.

               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no
                         reaction.  Runs to:

                                     AN ALLEY
                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
                         there, out of the line of fire.
                         He's sending off a squad to continue
                         their door-to-door.

               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
               familiarly.

               Captain hamill How was the road in?

                                     MILLER
                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,
                         a nice one, it had a cute little
                         flag with a couple of stars on it.

               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.

                                     MILLER
                         We called in a strike on the eighty-
                         eights that took it out, but it's
                         the Kraut spotter that counts,
                         wherever the hell that bastard is.

               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
               steeple.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson.

               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
               his back.

               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,
               along with Upham, watch curiously.

               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
               is fascinated.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is that?

               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
               shell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel
                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,
                         elevated three-glass scope and a
                         single-throw hammer.

                                     UPHAM
                         The Army gave you that?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep.

                                     UPHAM
                         You must be a hell a shot.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not where I come from.

               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
               and waits, absolutely motionless.

                                     UPHAM
                         That must be four thousand yards.

                                     JACKSON
                              (without taking his
                              eye from the scope)
                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure.

                                     UPHAM
                         You take account of the wind?

               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
               back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
               some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
               Upham and Jackson.

                                     REIBEN
                              (put-on Southern accent)
                         Dang right, he take 'count of the
                         wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a
                         Kentucky windage?

               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
               trigger.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, how many time I got to tell
                         you, I'm from Tennessee.

                                     REIBEN
                         They got squirrels there, too, right?

               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
               the St. Mere road is open.

               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
               Miller.

               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?

                                     MILLER
                         Very far, they're not coming this
                         way, they're going to take Caen first.

               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a
               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it
               gets better.  How many men did you bring?

                                     MILLER
                         Five, but we not staying, we're on
                         our way to Ramelle.

               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private
               Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, you know about that?

               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
               with the early wounded or dead.

               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,
               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.

                                     MILLER
                         Wonderful.

               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the
               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.

                                     MILLER
                         How do we get out of here?

               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
               tomorrow night.

               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
               head.

               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

               Miller shrugs.

               Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but
               I understand what you're doing?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?

               Captain hamill Good luck.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks.

               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
               sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's find someplace to hole up.

               Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head
               of the alley, Miller passes Upham.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         It was nothing.

                                     UPHAM
                         But you could have gotten killed and
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         Like I said, it was nothing.
                              (to the men)
                         Don't bunch up.

               He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham
               watches him go.

                                     UPHAM
                         Did you see what he did, back there?
                         He stepped right into the open, so I
                         could get across.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shit, that was no big deal.

                                     WADE
                         They can't kill him.

                                     SARGE
                         Like hell they can't.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade's right, it's some kind of
                         scientific, magnetic thing, I can't
                         explain it, but I've seen it.

                                     WADE
                         We all have, he's got nine lives, or
                         he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

               The men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is
               neither.

                                     SARGE
                         No one's bulletproof.  No one.
                              (beat)
                         C'mon, stay low.

               Sarge takes off after Miller.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

               Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins
               of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable
               spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.
               Reiben paces.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, could you please explain
                         the math of this mission to me?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, what do you want to know?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,
                         since when does six equal one?  What's
                         the sense in risking six guys to
                         save one?

                                     MILLER
                         Ours is not to reason why.

                                     REIBEN
                         Huh?

                                     MILLER
                         Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick
                         up this kid, high-tail it back to
                         division, everything'll work out
                         fine.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'd much rather die in Caen than
                         Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, there's a fairly good chance
                         you're not going to die at all.

                                     REIBEN
                         Easy for you to say, sir.
                              (beat)
                         Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring
                         his fucking neck.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor
                         bastard's mother.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you
                         got a mother?

                                     JACKSON
                         Last I knew.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of
                         us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain
                         has a mother.

               Miller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, maybe not the Captain, but the
                         rest of us have mothers.

                                     MILLER
                         You have orders, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

                                     MILLER
                         I'd love to hear it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is
                         a serious misallocation of valuable
                         military resources.  Miller Go on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am
                         a finely made instrument of warfare.
                         What I mean by that is, if you was
                         to put me with this here sniper rifle
                         anywhere up to and includin' one
                         mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear
                         line of sight, war's over.

               Miller nods.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I want you to listen closely
                         to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe.
                         Jackson, continue.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that
                         the entire resources of the United
                         States Army oughta be dedicated to
                         one thing and one thing only, and
                         that is to put me and this here weapon
                         on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle
                         of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one
                         to question decisions made up on
                         high, sir, but it seems to me that
                         saving one private, no matter how
                         grievous the losses of his family,
                         is a waste of my God-given talent.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade?

                                     WADE
                         Hell, I don't mind this mission,
                         sir, as long as there's something up
                         at Ramelle for...

                                     REIBEN
                              (finishing Wade's
                              sentence)
                         ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,
                         we heard that.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?

                                     UPHAM
                         Pass.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         I'm just here to keep a bunch of
                         numb-nuts, including one certain,
                         frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,
                         from getting themselves killed.

               Reiben eyes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         And what about you, Captain?

               Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, what's the matter with you?
                         I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain.
                         There's a chain of command.  Griping
                         goes one way, up, only up, never
                         down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to
                         my superior officers.  Up, get it?
                         I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe
                         in front of you.  How long you been
                         in the army?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.
                              (beat)
                         But if you weren't a captain, or if
                         I were a major, what would you say?

               Miller considers his response.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case, I would say this is an
                         excellent mission, with an extremely
                         valuable objective, worthy of my
                         best efforts.

               Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no
               obvious sarcasm.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         In addition, as I pointed out earlier,
                         I have a fondness for cheese and I
                         hope to have the opportunity to sample
                         some of the Ramelle products, when
                         we arrive there, to see if they live
                         up to their excellent reputation.
                         Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
                         for the mother of Private James Ryan
                         and I'm more than willing to lay
                         down my life, and the lives of my
                         men, especially you, Reiben, to help
                         relieve her suffering.  The men
                         thoroughly enjoy the performance.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, if you were not a captain, I
                         would compliment you, now, for being
                         an excellent liar.

                                     MILLER
                         But I am a captain.  If I were not a
                         captain, I would thank you for the
                         compliment and tell you that the
                         ability to lie comes from being a
                         top-notch poker player, which I am,
                         having learned at the side of my
                         mother who is, by popular acclaim,
                         the best poker player in...

               The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're
               about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         ...my home town, which shall remain
                         un-named.

               The men ease back, disappointed.

                                     MILLER
                         Any further thoughts on the subject?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like
                         to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,
                         fuck the cheese capital of France
                         and while we're at it, fuck Private
                         James Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll make a note of your suggestions
                         but I'll leave that last one to you,
                         especially if he's already dead.

               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets
               serious.

                                     MILLER
                         We move out in two hours, try and
                         get some sleep.

               The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all
               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange
               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
               suit.

               Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his
               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,
               he studies his maps while his men rest.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)

               Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,
               Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his
               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,
               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.

                                     SARGE
                         You ever going to open those letters?
                         Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe.

                                     SARGE
                         It's not normal, not reading letters
                         from home.

                                     MILLER
                         Since when have things been normal?

                                     SARGE
                         You got me.  Afraid of bad news?

                                     MILLER
                         Nope.

                                     SARGE
                         Good news?

               Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of
               them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at
               the men.

                                     SARGE
                         You think they'll be alright?

                                     MILLER
                         They're fine.  As long as they can
                         gripe, they'll be alright.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about you?

               Miller considers the question, doesn't answer.

                                     MILLER
                         They guys here aren't going to be
                         able to hold out until battalion
                         shows up.

                                     SARGE
                         Nope.

                                     MILLER
                         Command isn't going to let them
                         withdraw and the Germans sure as
                         hell aren't going to let them
                         surrender.

                                     SARGE
                         Three for three.

                                     MILLER
                         If we stayed, we could make a
                         difference.

                                     SARGE
                         You're kidding yourself.

                                     MILLER
                         You never know.

               They sit in silence for a moment.

                                     SARGE
                         I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now you're the one kidding yourself.
                              (beat)
                         Hell of  a mission.

                                     SARGE
                         Yup, hell of a mission.

               Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Rise and shine, boys.  Let's go.

               Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their
               gear.

               EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT

               SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY
               BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral
               toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,
               but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are
               very formidable-looking.

               EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill
               and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:

               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The
               AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
               countryside like a tidal wave.

               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.

               IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY
               is incredible, strange, other-worldly.

               EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.

               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.

               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.

               SARGE notices, says nothing.

               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes
               go back to the BLAZING SKY.

                                     SARGE
                              (awe-struck)
                         Makes you feel small, doesn't it?

                                     MILLER
                         It doesn't take this.

               Upham's face shows more fear than awe.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wasn't made for this.

                                     MILLER
                              (bitterly)
                         You think the rest of us were?

               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
               hold of himself and speaks gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect
                         you, this shit's gonna keep him up
                         all night, anyway.

               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, this ain't what they pay
                         us for.

               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points
               the way.

               Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a
               gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until
               you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.

               As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to
               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to
               Reiben.

               Gentle-faced private Here.

               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-
               ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's
               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

               Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at
               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.

               Reiben takes the ammo.

                                     REIBEN
                              (gently)
                         Just what I need.

               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands
               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks, but you may need these more
                         than us, or Ryan.

               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
               the ammo back.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's move out.

               Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,
               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill
               and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a
               strange bit of hope.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT

               The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The
               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.
               Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         A couple of weeks.  It started in
                         Portsmouth when they brought us down
                         for loading.

                                     SARGE
                         Is it getting worse?

                                     MILLER
                         No.  It comes and goes.  It stops
                         when I look at it.

                                     SARGE
                         You may have to find yourself a new
                         line of work, this one doesn't seem
                         to agree with you anymore.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll be alright.

               Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk
               on.

               EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)

               Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at
               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge
               brings up the rear.

               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate
               only with hand signals.

               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease
               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
               MEN appear.

               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
               go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of
               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed
               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.

               THE GERMANS PASS.

               MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh
               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
               exposed.  Shitting bricks.

               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad
               approaches.

               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-
               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries
               after Miller, staying close on his heels.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,
               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

               Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as
               Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
               signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn
               is visible.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it
                         up.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

               First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by
               the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.

               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.
               The war is far away.

               Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together
               without speaking for a moment.

                                     MILLER
                         It looks like a Renoir.

                                     UPHAM
                         Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth
                         Symphony, The Normandy?

                                     MILLER
                         I've been humming it.

                                     UPHAM
                         I heard.

                                     MILLER
                         It seemed appropriate.

                                     UPHAM
                         You know classical music?

                                     MILLER
                         Some.

                                     UPHAM
                         Where are you from, Captain?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the pool up to?

               Upham smiles, caught.

                                     UPHAM
                         Over three-hundred.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll tell you what, if I'm still
                         alive when it hits five-hundred,
                         I'll let you know and we'll split
                         the money.

                                     UPHAM
                         If that's the way you feel, why don't
                         we wait until it's up to a thousand.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't expect to live that long.

               Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five hundred, then.

               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself
               back into a commander and barks at Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, private.

               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure
               him out, then he simply follows him.

               EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN

               The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is
               lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,
               hundred of years old.

               Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They
               advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.
               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a
               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
               empty shell casings around his body.

               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to
               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
               gently to him in French.

               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands
               and translates.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five nights ago, he found this
                         paratrooper caught in a tree with a
                         broken leg.  The leg got infected.
                         Last night he went to Ville Cholet
                         to get a doctor.  The doctor refused
                         to come and when he got back, this
                         is what he found.  The Krauts must
                         have shown up while he was gone.

                                     MILLER
                         Did he see any sign of them?

               Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.

                                     UPHAM
                         No, but he heard firing, just east,
                         less that a kilometer.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank him and tell him we're sorry
                         about his loss.

               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.
               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last
               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
               edge of the field.

               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches
               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to
               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with
               bullets.

               Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.

                                     WADE
                         Captain.

               Staying low, they join Wade who has found:

               TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS

               A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.

               MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON

               Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The
               others crawl up behind them.

                                     MILLER
                         Where?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the shadow by those two trees.

                                     MILLER
                         My guess, too.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is it?

                                     MILLER
                         A machine gun.

               Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover
               of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, I've got an idea, let's go
                         around.

                                     MILLER
                         We can't leave it here.

                                     JACKSON
                         We left them eighty-eights.

                                     MILLER
                         They don't send planes to put out
                         machine guns.
                              (beat)
                         Two flank runners with surpressing
                         fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes
                         left has to be fast.

               Upham steels himself and steps forward.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

                                     REIBEN
                         He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

               Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.

                                     WADE
                         How fast?

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-four-five.

                                     WADE
                         Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-
                         two flat.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade goes left.

               Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is
               impressed.

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-two flat?

               Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.

                                     WADE
                         I would have won the states if some
                         bastard hadn't tripped me in the
                         finals.

               Miller points the others to their firing positions.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         ten yards, either side.

               As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,
               out of earshot of the men.

                                     SARGE
                         Rule of thumb, Captain, says you
                         ought to detail this one, instead of
                         going yourself.

               Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?

                                     SARGE
                         How about I go right, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         How about you take your position?

               Sarge hesitates.

                                     SARGE
                         How about...?

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         How about you shut up and take your
                         position?

               Sarge nods.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near
               Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.

                                     UPHAM
                         Good luck, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got
                         five lives.

                                     UPHAM
                         The men said, nine.

                                     MILLER
                         What do they know?
                              (beat)
                         I had nine, but I feel through the
                         ice when I was seven, my brother
                         pulled me out.  Then I used one when
                         a grenade landed in my foxhole in
                         Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one
                         on the beaches, one on the cliffs
                         and two getting here.

                                     UPHAM
                         That only leaves three.

                                     MILLER
                         Plenty.

               Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

                                     WADE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.

               MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.

               Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a
               moment.  Then:

               A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.

               SHATTERING THE QUIET.

                                     IN THE NEST
                         A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING
                         THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE
                         8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.
                         Four Germans in the nest, four more
                         outlying riflemen.

                                     MILLER
                         Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE
                         DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over
                         him.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS
               WADE HITS THE DIRT

               The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.

               SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM

               Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS
               THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND
               SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT

               Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.
                         No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.
                         SLAMS in another.  FIRES.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER

               He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.

                                     WADE
                         Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly
                         row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward
                         him.

                                     MILLER
                         Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles
                         up the roots.  Dives through the
                         brush.

                                     WADE
                         On a slight rise.  Can't hit the
                         dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately
                         sprints.

               WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.
               Goes down.

               SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
                         Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to
                         his feet, running.  Swings his
                         Thompson into firing position.  Racing
                         toward the nest.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         Tearing along the path.  Sees a German
                         rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM
                         DOWN.  Runs over the body without
                         breaking stride.

               SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN
               FIRE from Miller.

               The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow
               he's not hit.

                                     MILLER
                         TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his
                         Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German
                         riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls
                         the pin.

                                     THE NEST
                         The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel
                         from Sarge.  Too late.

                                     MILLER
                         THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.

               THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are
               KILLED.

               SARGE hollers to the others.

                                     SARGE
                         HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                                     MILLER
                         Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another
                         BURST.  KILLS the last of the German
                         riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto
                         the field.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS

               See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto
               the field.

                                     WADE
                         Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.
                         Astonished by the pain.

               ALL THE AMERICANS RUN

               Converging on Wade.  Miller points, and yells, without slowing
               down.

                                     MILLER
                         REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER!  COVER!

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Stop instantly.  Turn toward the
                         perimeter of the field.

                                     SARGE
                         Roots through his medical kit as he
                         runs.  Dropping and scattering
                         inessentials behind him.

                                     WADE
                         Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too
                         much pain.

               MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE

               Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both
               tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping
               one open.  Powder spills.

               REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.

                                     SARGE
                         Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
                         Pours sulfa powder.

                                     MILLER
                         About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the
                         wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

                                     MILLER
                         Damn it!

               Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.

                                     SARGE
                         Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.

                                     SARGE
                         Sulfa, more sulfa...

                                     WADE
                         Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.
                         Sees him preparing the morphine shot.
                         They both know.

                                     WADE
                         Yeah...morphine...make it a
                         double...huh...Captain...?

                                     MILLER
                         SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
                         Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine
                         straight to Wade's brain.  Motions
                         impatiently to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         More morphine, hurry up, come on,
                         come on...

                                     SARGE
                         Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.
                         Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the
                         morphine.

                                     MILLER
                         Snatches the morphine from Sarge.
                         Quickly and efficiently prepares a
                         second shot.  He's done this before.

                                     REIBEN
                         On guard, glancing back.  Pissed
                         off.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     UPHAM
                         Freaked out.  Trying to keep his
                         eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

                                     JACKSON
                         Watching.

                                     MILLER
                         Gives Wade the second shot.

                                     WADE
                         Feels the effects of the first shot.
                         He sees Upham and manages a pained
                         smile.

               WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,
               without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE
               DIES

               ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE

               UPHAM begins to weep.

               REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently
                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers
                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades
                         dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.
                         Sarge notices.

               Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
               see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.

               Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,
               rises and picks up his Thompson.

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         That was no twenty-two flat.

               Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.

                                     MILLER
                         He lied.  Let's move out.

               Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men
               hesitate, then slowly follow him.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY

               A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.
               The five G.I.'s walk, spread out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,
                         just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-
                         bitch.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shut up, will you?

                                     REIBEN
                         You shut up, this is the most fucked
                         up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned
                         Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

                                     JACKSON
                         Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         The hell he didn't.

               Miller motions to them curtly.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep it down.

               They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,
               the men don't hear.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to find someplace to hole
                         up for a bit.

               Sarge looks at Miller closely.

                                     SARGE
                         You alright?

                                     MILLER
                         Let's just find someplace.

               EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY

               Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good
               hiding place.

                                     MILLER
                         Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.
                         I'm going to re-con.

               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but
               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.
               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY

               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The
               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,
               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for
               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,
               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,
               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller
               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a
               thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.

                                     MILLER
                         What was the name of that kid at
                         Anzio, the one who got his face burned
                         off?

                                     SARGE
                         Vecchio.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember
                         his name, he was a good kid, remember
                         how he used to walk on his hands and
                         sing that song about the man on flying
                         trapeze?

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah.

                                     MILLER
                         You know why I'm such a good officer?
                         Because of my mother.  Have I ever
                         told you about her?

                                     SARGE
                         Bits and pieces.

                                     MILLER
                         She's the best poker player you ever
                         saw.  My father used to go to these
                         Saturday night games and lose his
                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him
                         an ultimatum, either she gets a
                         regular seat at the table or she
                         locks him in every Saturday night.
                         He squawked and so did his buddies
                         but after a while they gave in and
                         from the first night she sat down,
                         she never lost.  She could read those
                         cocky bastards like they were playing
                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her
                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
                         her coffee, she was a master.  She
                         won more money on shit hands than
                         anyone in the history of the game.
                         Every Saturday night, my father would
                         lose two, three hundred bucks and
                         she'd win it all back and then some.
                         And I'd stand there, glued to her
                         shoulder, from the time I was five
                         years old, watching every hand, every
                         move, studying how she did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's why I'm such a good officer,
                         I can look at a man's face and tell
                         you exactly what he's holding, and
                         if it's a shit hand, I know just
                         what cards to deal him.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about your own hand?

                                     MILLER
                         No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?
                         So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear
                         me apart when I'd get one of my men
                         killed, but what was I supposed to
                         do?  Break down in front of the ones
                         who were standing there waiting for
                         me to tell them what to do?  Of course
                         not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
                         I started to fall for my own bluff.
                         It was great, it made everything so
                         much easier.  Sarge Is that why your
                         hand's been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         It could be worse.  You know the
                         first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
                         Lie to your men.

                                     SARGE
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     MILLER
                         Not in so many words, but they tell
                         you you can have all the firepower
                         in the world and if your men don't
                         have good morale, it's not worth a
                         damn.  So if you're scared or empty
                         or half-a-step from a Section Eight,
                         do you tell your men?  Of course
                         not.  You bluff, you lie.

                                     SARGE
                         And how do you bluff yourself?

                                     MILLER
                         Simple, numbers.  Every time you
                         kill one of your men, you tell
                         yourself you just saved the lives of
                         two, three, ten, a hundred others.
                         We lost, what, thirty-one on the
                         cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times
                         that number by putting out those
                         guns.  That's over three hundred
                         men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.
                         Then thousand.  Any number you want.
                         See?  It's simple.  It lets you always
                         choose mission over men.

                                     SARGE
                         Except this time, the mission IS a
                         man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's
                         Ryan?  If they're both standing in
                         front of me and I have to shoot one
                         or the other, how do I choose?  Look
                         at my hand, there it goes again.

                                     SARGE
                         John, I've got to tell you, I think
                         you're about used up.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you're right, Keith.

                                     SARGE
                         You want me to take over?

               The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He
               looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.

                                     MILLER
                         No, but if I get any worse, you'll
                         have to relieve me.

                                     SARGE
                              (sighs)
                         Just what I want to do.

               They share a smile.

                                     MILLER
                         You know Wade was the eleventh of
                         the twelve, you're the last one still
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         I know.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't let yourself get killed, if
                         you do, they might make me give back
                         the medal and then I won't be able
                         to lip off to colonels anymore.

                                     SARGE
                         I'll do my best.

               They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller
               Hell of a...

                                     (BEAT)
                         Ah, forget it.

               Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting
               himself.  He's about ninety-five percent there.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks for drawing that machine gun
                         off me.

                                     SARGE
                         You're welcome, John.

                                     MILLER
                         But, that's my personal brand of
                         stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary
                         about it, if you do it again, you're
                         busted.

               Sarge allows himself a slight smile.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back
               to the men.

               EXT. CLEARING - DAY

               The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.
               No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.
               Miller barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Up.  We're moving out.

                                     REIBEN
                         I thought you said we had an hour,
                         sir?

                                     MILLER
                         Well now I'm saying we're moving
                         out.  Get off your ass.

               The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow.

                                     MILLER
                         What the hell's the matter with you,
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on
                         account of Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Who's Wade?

               No one responds.

                                     MILLER
                         I said, who the hell is Wade?

               The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand what you're doin',
                         but I respectfully request permission
                         to grieve in my own manner.

                                     MILLER
                         You'll grieve the way I tell you to
                         goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,
                         there was one, but he died a long
                         time ago, he's been dead for so long
                         you can hardly remember his name,
                         you understand?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand.  I don't like it,
                         but I understand.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, now get your goddamned gear.

               The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.
               Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his
               head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit
               to work.  He knows they have no choice.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,
               grim.

               EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY

               Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds
               up the map, points the way and they move out.

               EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY

               More progress.  The men are still grim.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what the best possible thing
                         that could happen is?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get
                         lockjaw, never say another word as
                         long as you live.

               Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         I've given this a lot of thought,
                         sir.  The best thing that could happen
                         is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Why's that?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, consider the possibilities.
                         A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take
                         him back to the beach.  Knowing you,
                         you don't let him carry my gear,
                         even though he really should, and we
                         all get killed, trying to keep him
                         alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Except for the last part, that one's
                         not bad.

                                     REIBEN
                         B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown
                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,
                         whose name I know you don't want me
                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.
                         The biggest piece is the size of a
                         pea.  We wander around, looking for
                         him until the Germans pick us off,
                         one after another.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't like that one.

                                     REIBEN
                         Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is
                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's
                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry
                         my gear, we have to carry his gear.
                         And him.

                                     MILLER
                         But we accomplish the mission.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe.  But what if he dies on the
                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,
                         sir?  The best possible situation
                         is, he's dead, we find his body,
                         more or less intact, we grab one of
                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back
                         to the beach, or better yet, we head
                         over to Caen and catch up with
                         division.

                                     MILLER
                         Has anyone ever told you, you're
                         officer material?

                                     REIBEN
                         No, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         That's a mystery to me.

               No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

               The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush
               near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  "Ramelle 3 Km."  Miller
               folds up the map.

                                     SARGE
                         Looks like we're going to beat those
                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.

               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something
               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they
               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't think so.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop
               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack
               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a
               bridge.

               CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL

               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

                                     GERMAN FLANK SQUADS
                         Hurry along the fields on either
                         side of the road, trying to keep up
                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS
                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten
                         themselves into the mucky water.
                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to
                         fire.

                                     THE GERMAN SQUAD
                         Approaches the bridge.

               PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES

               See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.

                                     MILLER
                         Is just about to open up on them.

                                     THE GERMAN SERGEANT
                         Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind
                         and CALLS to them.

                                     THE GERMAN PRIVATES
                         Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the
                         convoy.

                                     IN THE CULVERT
                         The Americans breathe again.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wonder where they're going.

                                     MILLER
                         Same place we are.

               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast
               is clear.  They head out.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY

               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,
               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone
               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.

               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.

               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like tea time, maybe they're
                         Brits.

                                     UPHAM
                         I sure hope so.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think they're waiting
                         for, Captain?

               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
               that sound, they don't like it.

               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,
               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two
               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
               There are four of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Puts away the binoculars and jerks
                         his head for his men to follow, low,
                         along the wall.  The men are happy
                         to do so, looking back nervously at
                         the German tanks.

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY

               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is
               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell
               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French
               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
               the firing.

               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He
               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
               firing.

               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings
               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on
               both sides of the bridge.

               MILLER AND HIS MEN

               Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the
               bridge.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like they've been having a
                         hell of a party, here, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

               A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF
                         A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?

               Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty.

                                     MILLER
                         I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE
                         COME.
                              (to his men)
                         Cover me.

                                     REIBEN
                         What if our guys open up, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         You're only allowed to shoot at
                         Germans, that's one of the rules.

                                     REIBEN
                         Have it your way, Captain.

               Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward
               the bridge.

               THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

               Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         POUR FIRE at the German positions,
                         SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.

                                     ON THE BRIDGE
                         The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM
                         OF BULLETS at the German positions.

               Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
               jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
               young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are
               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller
               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to
               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll keep it in mind.
                              (calls to Sarge)
                         OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.

               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
               they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

               Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to
               hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.

                                     MILLER
                         Things are tough all over.  We're
                         looking for a Private James Ryan.

               Forrest Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Is he here?

               Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

               Forrest Go get Ryan.

                                     (TO MILLER)
                         What do you want him for, sir?

               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and
               scrambles to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson, get a hold of command.

               Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to
               Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         How many men do you have?

               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
               to leap over the barricade.

               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge
               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

               Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's
               hailing I.D.   No response.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep trying.

               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

                                     PRIVATE JAMES RYAN
                         Dashing from cover to cover, making
                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an
                         American classic, nineteen years
                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.
                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and
                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's
                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his
                         face has a spark.  You can't help
                         but love this kid.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         All watch Ryan run toward them.

                                     JACKSON
                         So, that's Ryan.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
               barricade.  He salutes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see
                         me?

               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,
               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers
               have been killed in action.

               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
               Somehow he remains upright.

               Ryan All three?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes.

               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning
               him against some sandbags.

                                     THE PARATROOPERS
                         Are stunned at the news.  They look
                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they
                         can do.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         Also look at Ryan, but then, one
                         after another, they turn away,
                         adverting their eyes, looking a their
                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,
                         the sky, anything other than Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         We've been sent to get you out of
                         here.  You're going home.

               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a
               little room.

               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm
                         taking you and your men with me.

               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this
               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
               ninth Division.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.

               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm not going to leave you and your
                         men here to get killed.  Get them
                         together, we're moving out.

               A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.

                                     RYAN (O.S.)
                         No, sir.

               They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about
               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
               the arm and speaks softly to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Come on, Private, you're going home.

               Ryan jerks away from Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         No, sir.

               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.

                                     MILLER
                         Private.  I'm sorry about your
                         brothers but staying here and getting
                         yourself killed isn't going to help.

                                     RYAN
                         Sir, if the Krauts are holding this
                         bridge when division shows up, our
                         guys are going to be sitting ducks.

                                     MILLER
                         This bridge cannot be held.  The
                         Germans have two companies less than
                         three miles from here.  They have
                         tanks.

               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

                                     MILLER
                         Private, if you want to commit
                         suicide, that's your choice, but
                         you're going to have to wait until
                         after I get you back to the beach.
                         And you're not going to take these
                         men with you.

               Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm not leaving, sir.

               Miller starts to boil over.

                                     MILLER
                         The hell you aren't, you're comin'
                         with me if I have to drag you every
                         inch of the way.  You hear me,
                         Private?

                                     RYAN
                         I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
               resist.

                                     MILLER
                         Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
                         you're coming with me or
                         I'll...I'll...

               Ryan speaks softly.

                                     RYAN
                         What are you going to do, sir, shoot
                         me?

               Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind
               Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Uh, excuse me, Captain.

               Miller slowly turns and glares.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         So, what are a few tanks, sir?

               Miller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         He's right, we can't shoot him...well,
                         we could but we'd get in an enormous
                         amount of trouble.  And he's right
                         about the bridge, it's a hell of a
                         lot more important than he is.

               JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n...?

               Miller turns his glare on Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                              (continuing)
                         Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,
                         here, to kill two birds with one
                         stone.  Command seems to think keepin'
                         this boy alive is worth somethin'.
                         If we was to do that and hold this
                         bridge, good chance we'd get us a
                         bucket full of medals.  I might even
                         get me one 'a them big, fancy ones
                         like you got, so's I could sass any
                         officer in the whole dang army, you
                         included.

               Miller does a slow burn.

               UPHAM STEPS FORWARD

                                     UPHAM
                         I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         You don't count.

               SARGE STEPS UP

                                     SARGE
                         I do and personally, I'd rather get
                         the hell out of here, but somebody's
                         got to stay and take care of you and
                         these pin-head privates of yours.

               Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.

               Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir.

               Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                         See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous.

               Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote?
               What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This
               isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you
               follow them.  We don't vote!

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely
                         speaking hypothetically.  IF this
                         was a voting situation, then the
                         vote would have been unanimous.  But
                         of course, it's not a voting
                         situation, you're the captain, and
                         you give the orders, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         You're goddamned right, I give the
                         order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen
                         to me, you little pissant pieces of
                         shit, I am the ranking officer here
                         and what I say goes, is that clear?

               They all quickly nod.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Of course, sir.

               All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

               Miller looks from face to face.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case...
                              (beat)
                         I vote we stay.

               That's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them
               time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson,
                         get up on the bridgekeepers hut with
                         your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and
                         Upham move that machine gun so it
                         can cover the left flank, it's
                         worthless where it is.  Forrest, I
                         want a full inventory of all your
                         weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go.

               They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller
               for a moment.

                                     RYAN
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                              (gruffly gentle)
                         Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next
                         to me, no matter where I go, you
                         understand?

               Ryan salutes.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, come with me.

               Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check
               the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

               Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other
               paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.

               Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon
               grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy
               guns and about sixty rounds per man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it?

               Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, can I change my vote?

               Miller sighs, worried.

               EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY

               Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a
               crescent of sandbags.  His eye is at his scope.  He FIRES.

                                     A GERMAN SNIPER
                         Falls from a window on the edge of
                         town, dead.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sits beside Jackson with a pair of
                         binoculars, searching for another
                         target.  The German sniper fire has
                         subsided for now.  Ext. bridge - day
                         Miller watches as Ryan and several
                         other paratroopers dig a series of
                         trenches across the street, leading
                         to the bridge.

               Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.

               Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head.  He speaks
               to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, see what you can do to make
                         those buildings inhospitable.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE
               DISTANCE.  They all turn at the sound.

                                     UPHAM
                         Eighty-eights, right?

               Miller nods.

                                     UPHAM
                         I can tell what the gunners had for
                         dinner.

                                     MILLER
                         Those guns are close.

               Forrest Just south of town.  The Krauts have a two gun
               emplacement, we saw it on the way in.  That's how we knew
               they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out
               of us.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope they don't change their
                         mind.

               Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.

               INT. BUILDING - DAY

               Within sight of the bridge.  Sarge carefully plants a wire-
               triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.  He
               sets the wire, then carefully backs away.

               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

               Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine
               gun nest.  Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham
               at his side.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think?

                                     MILLER
                         Well, if we had ten times the men
                         and a lot more ammo, we might stand
                         a chance, but not against those tanks.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we going to do?

                                     MILLER
                         We're going to hope like hell the
                         tanks were on their way somewhere
                         else.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe Caen.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope, because we're sure as
                         hell not going to do any damage to
                         them with what we have here.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about our grenades?

                                     MILLER
                         Those are Tigers, they have six-inch
                         armor, they don't even notice
                         grenades.

                                     UPHAM
                         Would they notice and eighty-eight?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, you got one?

                                     UPHAM
                         The Germans do.

               Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are
                         going hunting.

               Upham runs off.  Sarge shakes his head.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, oh.

                                     MILLER
                         Out of the mouth of babes.

               EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT

               Dark.  Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with
               blackening soot.  The rest of Miller's men and several
               paratroopers, including Ryan, look on.  Upham is distressed.
               Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, you've got to learn the
                         difference between whining and
                         griping.  You can't just rely on
                         natural ability, you've got to study
                         and practice.

                                     UPHAM
                         But, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         There you go again, that's whining,
                         that's not okay.

                                     UPHAM
                         Goddamn it, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         That's better, but you've still got
                         a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben,
                         he's a natural and works at it, he'll
                         give you some pointers.

                                     REIBEN
                         Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have
                         him pissing and moaning with the
                         best of us.

                                     MILLER
                         See to it.

               RYAN Steps up to Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'd like to go, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         No, private, I want you to stay here,
                         keep your head down, don't do anything
                         brave or stupid.

                                     REIBEN
                         Aren't they the same thing, sir?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I don't know what I'd do
                         without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close
                         to you and alive.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         You ready?

               Forrest Yes, sir.

                                     JACKSON
                         You betcha, sir.

               Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.

                                     REIBEN
                              (southern accent)
                         Y'all come back.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the
                         way I talk?

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy southern accent)
                         Hell, no!

               Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest
               into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the
               night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads.

                                     IN THE DARKNESS
                         A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He
                         crawls to the edge of the emplacement
                         and freezes in the shadows.

               A moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that,
               Jackson silently crawls up to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a
                         weakness.  There is none.  He motions
                         to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The
                         three of them settle into the
                         darkness.

               EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan
               is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's
               men eye him.

                                     SARGE
                         Private, I'm sorry about your
                         brothers.

               Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip
               from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was
               the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?

                                     SARGE
                         Wade.

                                     RYAN
                         Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here
                         to keep me alive...I never met
                         him...he didn't know me from Adam,
                         strange.  What was he like?

                                     SARGE
                         A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,
                         here, used to call him a happy idiot.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell, I did.

                                     RYAN
                         My brothers would be mighty pissed
                         off at me, if they knew I let some
                         guy get killed trying to keep me
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         You didn't let anybody get killed,
                         you didn't even know we were coming
                         up here.

                                     RYAN
                         Sure, I know, but...
                              (sighs)
                         Goddamn it all...

               The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch.

                                     A SHADOW
                         It's Miller.  Easing through the
                         darkness.  Closer to one of the
                         sentries.

               Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller
               nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the
               sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS.

                                     BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.

                                     A GERMAN SENTRY
                         Approaches.  He sees Forrest.  Just
                         as he's about to open up with his
                         sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him
                         from behind, STABS him, eases the
                         body silently to the ground.

                                     MILLER AND JACKSON
                         Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.

               Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the
               German's truck.

                                     ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY
                         Rounds a corner.  Sees them.  OPENS
                         UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.

               Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.

                                     OTHER GERMANS
                         Race over, FIRING.

                                     JACKSON
                         Covering them, OPENS UP.  Kills the
                         advancing Germans.

               MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.

               FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.

               JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.

               Spins.

               Still FIRING.

               Giving Miller cover.

               MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.

               JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.

               JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.

                                     THE WINDSHIELD
                         Is shattered by bullets.

               Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.

                                     FORREST
                         In the back of the truck.

               Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.

               MILLER FLOORS IT.

               The truck DRIVES through the Germans.

               The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.
               MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.

               The Germans FIRING after them.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a
               gauntlet of Germans.  As they approach the bridge, the other
               American's FIRE COVER for them.

               Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.

               SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS

               THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the
               barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         RYAN!  GET BACK THERE!

               Ryan ignores him.  They get the eighty-eight safely behind
               the barricade.  Miller grabs Ryan.

                                     RYAN
                         Sorry, sir.

               Miller fumes.  he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,
               clearly not pissed at Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't do that again.

                                     RYAN
                         I won't need to sir, it's already
                         here, behind the barricade so...

               Miller GROWLS.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine.  Very
               gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt.  They cover it and
               step back carefully.

               Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their
               tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll
               place the rest of the mines.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Quiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do
               now but wait.

               ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT

               Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see
               Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning
               the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.

                                     REIBEN
                         What do you think?

                                     JACKSON
                         I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

                                     REIBEN
                         I mean, Ryan, what do you think of
                         him?

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't half-bad, I guess.

                                     REIBEN
                         I guess.

               They're quiet for a moment.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         Nope, he ain't Wade.

               Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs through the shadows and
                         stops at the bridgekeepers hut.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben...

               Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun
               nest.

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir.

               REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.

               MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in
               the rear machine gun nest.

                                     MILLER
                         You set?  Sarge nods.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to
               check the others.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

               First light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE
               them in their positions:

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Manning the forward machine gun nest.

                                     JACKSON
                         Behind the sandbags, on top of the
                         bridgekeeper's hut.

               FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS

               Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward
               and the rear machine gun nests.

                                     RYAN AND SARGE
                         Manning rear machine gun.

                                     MILLER
                         At the bridgehead, waiting.

               SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD

               All eyes turn.

               SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER

               Dashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant.
               Then another.  And another.

                                     MILLER
                         Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down
                         behind some sandbags.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE THEY COME!

               A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

               THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE

                                     REIBEN
                         OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         At least fifty of them, advancing on
                         the bridge.  Running from cover to
                         cover.  A squad pushing a French
                         truck, using it as a shield.

                                     JACKSON
                         Calmly picking off the attacking
                         Germans.

                                     THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN
                         Make their way down the streets.
                         Along the riverbank.  Through the
                         houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING
                         from all directions.

               REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.
                         Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Running out of ammo.  See that there's
                         nothing else they can do.

                                     REIBEN
                         Time to go.

               Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.
               Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as
               they can.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER

               REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.
               Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.

               They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.

               DIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them.

                                     RYAN IS FIRING
                         With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops
                         several Germans.

                                     GERMANS EVERYWHERE
                         They swarm over the first barricade.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES A BURST into a German's belly.
                         HITS another with the stock of his
                         Thompson.

               HAND-TO-HAND.

               FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

               FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a
               flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of
               the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE
               PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late.

               THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER
               PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE

               No time to react.

                                     HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING
                         Half a dozen Germans break through.

               Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.

                                     RYAN
                         Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES.
                         KILLS the German.

                                     MILLER
                         Struggling with a pair of Germans.

                                     JACKSON
                         FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on
                         Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open
                         Miller's face with bits of skull.

                                     RYAN
                         Leaps onto the final German attacking
                         Miller.  That German raises his rifle
                         on Ryan.

               UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON

               All see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.

                                     THE STUNNED GERMAN
                         About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by
                         bullets from three directions.

                                     UPHAM
                         I got him.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell you did, I got him.

                                     JACKSON SMILES
                         He got him.

               MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four
               Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben
               and Upham:

                                     MILLER
                         BACK!  LET'S GO!

               They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make
               it to the barricade.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves
                         Ryan firing the rear machine gun.
                         Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING
                         COVER.  Exposed.

                                     BULLETS EVERYWHERE
                         MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the
                         barricade.  Dive over.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees they've made it.  FIRES A FINAL
                         BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of
                         bullets right behind him.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth.  Trying to
               cover Sarge.  Too many Germans.

               SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.  MILLER AND THE OTHERS
               continue to fire, horrified.

               SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET

               Cradling the B.A.R.  Stumbling toward cover.  Slowing.
               Bleeding.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Desperately trying to cover him.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Open up with a volley.

                                     SARGE
                         Is almost there.

               ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE

               As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough.

                                     SARGE
                         Five feet from the sandbags, his
                         back is TORN APART by Germans fire.
                         He looks down, stunned at his chest.
                         Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An
                         instant of surprise, more than fear.

               He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls
               onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.
               THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Who killed Sarge are killed.  The
                         others back off for now.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the
                         barricade.  Sees that he's dead.

               THE GERMANS RETREAT.

               Around the corner.

                                     MILLER
                         Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling
                         next to him.

                                     THE OTHERS
                         Watch, start to gather.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Get back to your positions!

               They hesitate.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

               They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move.
               He can't take his eyes off Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Doesn't move.  He just stares at
                         Sarge's body.

                                     RYAN
                         Looks at Miller, sees him growing
                         weak, starting to sway.  He gently
                         tries to move Miller aside.

                                     RYAN
                         I'll take care of Sarge...

               Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller
               grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made
               as he kneeled over Wade's body.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?  Who's Sarge?

               But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The
               hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's
               called his own bluff.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once.

               Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have
               tightened their perimeter.

               Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.

               They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.

               Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

                                     MILLER
                         English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.

               Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.

                                     UPHAM
                         What'd you say, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I teach English at Addley High School
                         in Addley, Pennsylvania.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Like hell, you did.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, what about our deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I changed my mind.

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I coach the baseball team, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         No kiddin'?

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     UPHAM
                         Forget it.

               They all sit in silence.

                                     MILLER
                         You know that cruise ship Wade's
                         grandfather was on?

               They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's
               talking about.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         I wonder if his cabin is still
                         available?

                                     REIBEN
                         That's not where I am.  Miller No?
                         Where are you?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm in a dressing room with Mrs.
                         Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife.
                         She's an easy forty-four, double E,
                         but I've convinced her she's a thirty-
                         eight D and I'm watching her try and
                         squeeze herself into a side-stay,
                         silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle
                         with s Helf-lift brassiere.
                              (smiles)
                         She's having a devil of a time,
                         getting into that thing.

               They all share Reiben's dream for a moment.  Then Jackson
               smiles.

                                     JACKSON
                         Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy,
                         it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and
                         we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a
                         flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...

                                     REIBEN
                         Jackson, how many times I got to
                         tell you, you're from Tennessee.

                                     JACKSON
                         I am, but I like imported whiskey.
                         So there I am and I hear the biggest
                         ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a
                         rustlin' right there in front of me.
                         That ole' boy comes right out of the
                         brush, I got a clear shot and he
                         knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.
                         I aim, I got my finger tight on the
                         trigger and then I just smile and
                         say to that ole' coon, go on, now,
                         you get out 'a here.  Then I sit
                         down on a hollow log and take me a
                         right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

               Upham smiles.

                                     UPHAM
                         I don't know, I kind of like Wade's
                         idea about the cruise ship.  I've
                         never been to Tahiti.

                                     REIBEN
                         What about you, Captain?

               Miller smiles.  He knows exactly where he is.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm in my backyard, lying in my
                         hammock, with my arm around my wife,
                         listening for the sound of breaking
                         glass.

                                     JACKSON
                         Say what, Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         You see, I've got the best house in
                         all of Addley.  It's not the biggest
                         house, but it's got the best location,
                         right next to the junior high baseball
                         field.  The garage windows face left
                         field.  The guy who owned the house
                         before me had these heavy screen S
                         put over them.  The first thing I
                         did when I bought the place was take
                         off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-
                         two yards from home plate to my garage
                         windows.  It takes a hell of a junior
                         high kid to hit a ball that far.  I
                         look at my garage windows as a
                         Motivator and a way to scout the
                         kids coming up, the ones who are
                         going to give us a shot at the state
                         championship.  I lay there in my
                         hammock and every time I hear the
                         sound of breaking glass, I know we're
                         one step closer to winning it all.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't that get kind of expensive,
                         Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         It's worth it.

                                     JACKSON
                         To each, his own.

               They're all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         How about you, James?

               Ryan sighs.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm home, playing basketball with my
                         brothers, it's evenin' time, we're
                         trying' to get in a few more points
                         before it's too dark to see the ball.
                         That's where I am.

               They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes
               it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all
               eat in silence.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN

               First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.
               A SOUND.  Louder.  And louder.  A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES
               toward the village.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN

               All are awake.  At their positions.  Waiting.

                                     MILLER
                         Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF
                         THE TANK.  Barely has time to react.
                         Sees:

               THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN

                                     MILLER
                         Here they come.

                                     REIBEN
                         FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

               THE GERMANS KEEP COMING

               Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         Manning the forward machine gun.
                         Way out front.  Sees that he's going
                         to be cut off.  He grabs the hot
                         gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.
                         He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK
                         toward the bridge.

               HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY
               BULLETS.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions near the bridge.
                         Moving in.  FIRING.  Overwhelming.
                         They're everywhere.

                                     THREE GERMANS
                         Break through the perimeter.

               RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one
                         German.  STABS the other.

               RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt.

               REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE
               GUN.

               OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A
               LONG BURST.  Germans drop.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES again.  More Germans drop.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions in the building near
                         the bridge.

               They start working their way to the tops of the nearby
               buildings.

               Making their way along the riverbanks.

                                     REIBEN AND RYAN
                         Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding
                         the ammo belt.

                                     REIBEN
                         MORE AMMO!

                                     UPHAM
                         Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He
                         grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS
                         toward Reiben and Ryan.

               SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

               OPEN UP on him.

               BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there.

                                     UPHAM
                         TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart.
                         Stumbles the final few steps to the
                         machine gun nest.  Falls on the
                         sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the
                         ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD.

               RYAN STUNNED.

               For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN
               FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the
               one almost out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the
                         advancing Germans.

               THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK

                                     MILLER
                         Knows what that means.  He hears the
                         RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

                                     MILLER
                         TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME!

                                     RYAN AND REIBEN
                         Immediately grab the machine gun and
                         ammo and race back to the rear nest.

               Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST
               TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two
               German infantry platoons.

                                     JACKSON
                         On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking
                         off German soldiers who follow the
                         tank.

               A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks
               voice-tube.

                                     THE TANK
                         Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning
                         it's turret towards the bridgekeepers
                         hut.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON!

                                     JACKSON
                         Knows what's coming but he holds his
                         position, continuing to pick off
                         German soldiers.

                                     THE TANK BLASTS
                         THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON
                         ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to
                         react.  Then, they turn their
                         attention back to the eighty-eight.
                         Frantically turning the aiming cranks.
                         Lowering the barrel to point blank.

               TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               Which can fire first.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Win the race.

                                     FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A
                         SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Quickly reload the eighty-eight.
                         FIRE AGAIN.

               DESTROY THE SECOND TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech
                         of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on
                         the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE.

               RUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks.

                                     RYAN
                         FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Races through the debris.  Trailed
                         by BULLETS.

                                     REIBEN
                         With the machine gun.  Covers Miller.
                         Keeping most of the German infantry
                         down.

               RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun.  Opens up.  Helping
               to cover Miller.

               THE LAST GERMAN TANK

               Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.
               Ready to blow him to bits.

                                     MILLER
                         Is almost there.  He arms the satchel
                         charge.

               THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.

               BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS

                                     MILLER
                         Throws the satchel charge under the
                         tank.  Rolls off the edge of the
                         bridge.  Lands on the embankment
                         below.

               THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES

               MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

               Almost out of ammo.

               MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,
               hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!

               Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

               A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard
               yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddamn it!

                                     REIBEN
                         More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them
                         The fear on their faces turns to
                         resignation.  They know that they
                         are dead men.  They settle into their
                         positions, and prepare to fire and
                         die.

               They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

               THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
               smile...then a real smile...

               AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then
               ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...

               MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN

               Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along
               with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

               They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after
               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a
               few among the departing Germans.

                                     THE ADVANCING TROOPS
                         Run onto the bridge and start to
                         secure the position.  A SERGEANT and
                         a few of HIS MEN look around,
                         curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
                         Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
                         among the bodies.

               A MAJOR strides up.

               Major Report, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,
                         that's Private Richard Reiben and
                         that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-
                         and-First Airborne.

               The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Ryan?

               One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

               Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

               The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

               Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

               Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.

               EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY

               American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
               road and over the bridge.

               MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN

               Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down
                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a
                         long moment.  Then, with a steady
                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
                         dog-tags.  Then he does the same to
                         Jackson and Upham.

               REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands and walks back to Reiben and
                         Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan
                         who grips them tightly and nods in
                         thanks.

               Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
               he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

               Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller
               down the road, away from the bridge.

                                     CAMERA CRANES UP
                         The three dirty, bloodied, tired men
                         walk down the road, ignored by the
                         fresh troops marching in the opposite
                         direction.

                                     RYAN
                         Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, Private.

                                     RYAN
                         Upham and Jackson, what were they
                         like?

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was
                         writing a book.

                                     RYAN
                         Yeah?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the
                         220 in twenty-four-five.

                                     RYAN
                         No kidding.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,
                         he was going to be a preacher, his
                         father and uncles have a traveling
                         ministry out of the back of a stretch
                         Hudson.

                         And Sarge?

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?
                              (beat)
                         He was the best friend I ever had.
                              (smiles)
                         Lemme tell you about Sarge...

               They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
               and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
               road and over the bridge.

               Fade out.

               CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The
               THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The
               power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back
               the hair and rattles the ears.

               Huge fifteen inch guns.

               SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT

               Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from
               German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the
               beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers,
               pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

                         At the far end of the beach, a ninety-
                         foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers.
                         Ringed by fortified machine gun nests.
                         A clear line-of-fire down the entire

                         Make their way toward the base of
                         the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of
                         explosions.

                         THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE
                         STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows
                         through the waves.

               THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN

               Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough.
               Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them.

               A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT

               A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

               The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.
               FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into
               the bow.

               THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS

               BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes
               the controls.

                                     A YOUNG SOLDIER
                         His face covered with the remains of
                         the motorman.  Starts to lose it.
                         Begins to shudder and weep.  His
                         name is DeLancey.

               THE BOYS AROUND HIM

               Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects
               them.  It starts to spread.

                                     A FIGURE
                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself
                         in front of DeLancey.

               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
               helmet and lights the cigar.

               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
               terrified.

               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

               Delancey Oh, Jesus...

               Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
               left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for
               those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
               cheek and moves on to the bow.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL
                         IN FRONT OF THEM.

               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND

               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none
               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it
               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
               eyes back to the objective.

               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

               The six surviving boats alongside.

               EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

               From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

               THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN

               A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.  A dozen
               men are INSTANTLY KILLED.  Among them, DeLancey.

                                     MILLER
                         Somehow survives.  Jumps into the
                         breakers.

                                     MILLER
                         MOVE, GODDAMN IT!  GO!  GO!  GO!

                                     EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE
                         THE GERMANS On the edge of the cliff.
                         Rain down MACHINE GUN FIRE and
                         GRENADES.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Struggle through the surf.  FIRING
                         up as best they can.  Making for the
                         base of the cliffs.

               INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,

               EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE

                                     MILLER
                         Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS.
                         Uses hand signals and curt orders.

                                     MILLER
                         THERE!  THERE!  HOOKS THERE!  FIRE
                         SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!

                                     THE MEN
                         Obey instantly.  Set the grappling
                         hooks.  Take position.  Return fire.

               THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

               Drown out most voices.  Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED
               AND DYING.

                                     THE MEN
                         Know what they have to do.  Start up
                         the ropes.  Into the teeth of the
                         German defenders.

                                     MILLER
                         Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine
                         gun.  Starts climbing with the first
                         group.

                                     THE CLIFF FACE
                         The Americans swarm up the ropes.
                         Taking turns firing up at the Germans.

               MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

               A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.
               Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs
               on.

                                     HALF-WAY
                         An American private is HIT.  FALLS,
                         taking two others with him.  All
                         three land on the rocks below.
                         Another way to die.

                                     NEAR THE TOP
                         Less steep.  They leave the ropes.
                         Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.

                                     MILLER
                         Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.
                         Others bottleneck behind them.  Miller
                         scans the route and the defenders.

               Sees an open gap.  Deadly.  Beyond is a protective overhang.
               With a clear line to the top.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the route.

               Miller motions to six men huddled near him.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Take an instant to get ready.  Then
                         SCRAMBLE into the gap.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               Do their best to cover them.  POUR FIRE up at the Germans.
               Bad angle.  No Germans are hit.

                                     THE SIX MEN
                         Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN
                         FIRE.  All KILLED.  They fall to the
                         rocks below.

               SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and
               best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.

               Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         It's the only way.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns to the next half-dozen men.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU'RE NEXT!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Move to the head of the gap.  Miller
                         moves for a better angle against the
                         machine guns.  Calls to JACKSON, a
                         tall, gangly Southern country boy,
                         sharp-shooter.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,
                         WILL YOU?

                                     JACKSON
                              (heavy Southern accent)
                         You betcha, Captain.

               Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.
               Turns to the second six.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Take deep breaths.  Head into the
                         gap.

               MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE

               JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.
               SARGE gets one.  Not enough.

                                     THE SECOND SIX
                         Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS.  All are
                         KILLED.

                                     MILLER
                         Turns, looking for the next six.
                         His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN
                         who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.
                         Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy Brooklyn accent)
                         Captain, can I put in for a transfer?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start
                         the paperwork.

                                     THE THIRD SIX
                         Moves into place.  Sarge and Miller
                         exchange a look.  They both see the
                         madness of what they're doing.

               MILLER AND THE OTHERS

               OPEN UP on the Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     SARGE
                         Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.
                         Scrambles into the gap.  The other
                         five right behind.

                                     IN THE GAP
                         BULLETS EVERYWHERE.

               Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce
               down.  EXPLODE below.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller
               sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.

               A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING
               TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.

               THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

               SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He
               swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward
               Miller.

               A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant
               from death.

               SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE

               Under the overhang to safety.

               MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL
               IS BLOWN OFF.

               UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'll be Goddamned!  I'm not dead!

               Sarge hollers back to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO
                         THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!

                                     MILLER
                         I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.

               Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.
               HIT more Germans.

               SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop
               near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw
               long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.

               THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.

               Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.

                                     MILLER
                         Crosses the gap.  His men follow.

                                     AT THE CREST
                         The Americans swarm over the top.
                         FIRING.

               TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.

               Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans
               are CUT DOWN.

               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man
               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel
               charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade, your turn.

               Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.

               Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to
               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.
               Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED
               EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.

                                     MILLER AND SARGE
                         Survey the field.

                                     SARGE
                         What the hell were you doing?  Drawing
                         fire!

                                     MILLER
                         Worked, didn't it?

                                     SARGE
                         You tryin' to get yourself killed?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need to, the Krauts go that
                         covered.

               Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff
               at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering
               the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.

               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves
               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German
               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE
               surround him.  DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of
               CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands
               in the heart of Washington, D.C.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:
                         WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.

               JUNE 8, 1944

               INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,
               quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.

                                     A CLERK
                         Older than the others, sad-eyed,
                         adds a sheet of paper to a large
                         pile in his out-box.

                                     CLOSE SHOT
                         An outgoing telegram.  It reads:
                         "We regret to inform you...killed in
                         action...heroic service..."  This is
                         the paperwork of death.

                                     THE CLERK
                         Pulls out a file.  Reads.  Finds
                         something troubling.  Quickly shuffles
                         through some other papers.  Finds
                         what he's looking for.  Rises from
                         his desk and hurries out of the
                         office.

               INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Seen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG
               LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.
               He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the
               office with the clerk on his heels.

               INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks
               to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
               bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the
               papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.

               INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

               A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The
               walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
               ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly
               hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff
               officer, walks in.

               Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
               about.

               One-armed colonel Yes?

               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha
               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother
               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this
               morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
               this afternoon.

               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear
               and freeze.

               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The
               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
               Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.

               One-armed colonel Is he alive?

               Young captain We don't know.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly
               to the Captain.

               One-armed colonel Come with me.

               The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his
               heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.

               EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY

               A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising
               behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.

               EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY

               A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as
               far as the eye can see.

                                     IN THE YARD
                         A tire swing.  A bushel basket nailed
                         to the barn over a dirt basketball
                         court.

                                     A PORCH SWING
                         Sits empty.  Moves slightly.

               ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR

               Four American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service.

                                     MARGARET RYAN
                         Steps out.  Around sixty.  Her face
                         shows the lines of a life of hard
                         work and mother hood.  A good woman.

               She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the
               fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind
               the black car.

               She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her
               house.  She starts to grow uneasy.

               As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She
               reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

               The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,
               one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.

               INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY

               Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
               GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
               his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half-
               a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
               the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the
               file.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                              (softly)
                         Goddamn it.

               One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company
               in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan
               brothers died on the Juneau.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Any contact with the fourth brother,
                         James?

               One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles
               inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines.

               General Marshall hardens.

                                     GENERAL MARSHALL
                         Well, if he's alive, we're going to
                         send someone to get him the hell out
                         of there.  That's just what the
                         General's staff wanted to hear.

               EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY

               NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.
               Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force
               of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the
               craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in
               the distance.

                                     SUPERIMPOSITION:

                                     MILLER
                         Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through
                         the fire and dives into a sludge-
                         filled crater.  He surfaces, sees
                         Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a
                         horrific smell.  Their conversation
                         is repeatedly broken by FIRING And
                         DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Jesus Christ!  What the hell are we
                         swimming in?

                                     REIBEN
                         Shit, sir.

                                     SARGE
                         Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're
                         in a cranberry bog.

                                     REIBEN
                         Out of the frying pan, into the
                         fucking latrine.

                                     MILLER
                         Look at the bright side, the Krauts
                         sure as hell don't want to advance
                         and hold this cesspool.

               Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.

                                     MILLER
                         Get Fire Control, we need some
                         artillery...

               Radioman Trying, sir.

               MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, what if they send some other
                         company into Caen ahead of us while
                         we're pinned down here?

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, we're the only Rangers
                         this side of the continent, we've
                         got to be first into Caen.

                                     SARGE
                         Who cares?

                                     REIBEN
                         I care.  Don't you know what Caen's
                         famous for, Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         Frogs?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie.

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah?  So?

               THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge
               and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German
               positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck
               down again.

                                     REIBEN
                         So, you ever heard of employee
                         discounts?  My uncle sells shoes,
                         gets twenty-five percent off
                         everything in the line, got a closet
                         filled with the best looking shoes
                         you ever seen.

               MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

                                     REIBEN
                         Just picture some French number been
                         spending all day, every day, making
                         cream-colored, shear-body negligees
                         with gentle-lift silk cups and
                         gathered empire waists, what the
                         hell you think she wears at night?

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, how the hell do you know so
                         much about lingerie?

                                     REIBEN
                         Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's
                         got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in
                         it, from the time I could crawl, we
                         carry Caen lingerie, it's the best
                         there is, it's all I been thinking
                         about since the invasion.

               Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS
               HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.

                         There's a war on, good chance they're
                         not still making lingerie in Caen.

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Captain, they'll always make
                         lingerie, it's one of the three basic
                         needs of man -- food, shelter, silk
                         teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.

                                     REIBEN
                         Happy to, sir.

               Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at
               H.Q., right away.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe the war's over.

               A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops
               falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben
               looks dubiously at Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I don't think so, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Radioman)
                         Stay at it until you get fire control.
                              (to Sarge)
                         Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles
               out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.

               EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY

               Chaos.  Under fire.  INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN
               SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Runs over the broken ground and makes
                         it to the sandbagged H.Q.  He stumbles
                         down the make-shift stairs.

               INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY

               Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which
               continue through the scene.  Miller salutes a Major.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.

               Major Go on in.

               Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a
               dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.
               Very busy.  A field map dominates the center of the small
               space.

               The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him
               respectfully.  He's clearly someone special.

               COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.
               He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of
               the storm.  He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...I understand your problem, but if
                         we don't get those tanks off-loaded
                         by 0600, we're going to have an entire
                         division up at Caen with its ass
                         hanging out of its pants...

               A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of
               paper.

               Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.

                                     MILLER
                         My what?

               Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-
               action.

               Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.

                                     MILLER
                         Find a chaplain.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                              (into field-phone)
                         ...alright, let me know when.

               Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Have the Second and Third Regiments
                         hold at St. Michel until we get those
                         tanks.  Aide Yes, sir.

               Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Report.

                                     MILLER
                         Sector four is secured, we put out
                         the last three German one-fifty-fives,
                         found them about two miles in from
                         Ponte du Hoc.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Resistance?

                                     MILLER
                         A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,
                         we took twenty-three prisoners, turned
                         them over to intelligence.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Casualties?

                                     MILLER
                         Fourty-four, twenty one dead.

               An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.

                                     MILLER
                         They didn't want to give up those
                         one-fifty-fives, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         It was a hard assignment, that's why
                         you got it.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Where are your men now?

                                     MILLER
                         Pinned down, a mile east of here,
                         waiting for some help from the navy
                         guns.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         I'm sending Simpson to take over for
                         you, the division is going to Caen,
                         you're not coming with us, I have
                         something else for you.

                                     MILLER
                         Sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         There's a Private James Ryan who
                         parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
                         First near Ramelle.  I want you to
                         take a squad up there.  If he's alive,
                         bring him back to the beach for
                         debarkation.  Take whoever you need,
                         you've got your pick of the company.

                                     MILLER
                         A private, sir?

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         He's the last of four brothers, the
                         other three were killed in action.
                         This is straight from the Chief of
                         Staff.

                                     MILLER
                         But, sir...I...I...

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Spit it out, Captain.

               MILLER HESITATES, THEN:

                                     MILLER
                         Respectfully, sir, sending men all
                         the way up to Ramelle to save one
                         private doesn't make a fucking,
                         goddamned bit of sense.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel
               Anderson glares at Miller.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         You think just because you hold the
                         Congressional Medal of Honor, you
                         can say any damn thing you please to
                         your superior officers?

               Miller considers the question, then smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir, more or less.

               Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
               off, then he smiles, too.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Alright, I'll give you that.
                         Continue.

                                     MILLER
                         The numbers don't make sense, sir.
                         His brothers are dead, that's too
                         bad, but they're out of the equation.
                         Sending men up there is bleeding
                         heart crapola from three thousand
                         miles away.  One private is simply
                         not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson
                         This one is.  He's worth a lot more
                         than that.  Which is why I'm sending
                         you, you're the best field officer
                         there is.

               Miller Shrugs.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?
                         Fine officer, regular church goer,
                         writes poetry, he might like a mission
                         like this.
                              (beat)
                         And he's taller than me.

               Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's
               time to get back to business.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         That's enough, Captain, you have
                         your orders.  Major Thomas will fill
                         you in.

               Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes.

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.

                                     COLONEL ANDERSON
                         Good luck, John.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank you, sir.

               Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
               Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
               the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they
               go back to work.

               EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY

               A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the
               deck of the enormous ship.

               EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY

               HUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German
               position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.

                                     IN THE CRATERS
                         Miller's Ranger company ducks and
                         covers.  The BARRAGE SUBSIDES.  The
                         Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging
                         from crater to crater, advancing
                         against the remaining Germans who
                         return SMALL ARMS FIRE.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs and dives into a crater
                         with Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge,
                         we're heading out.

                                     SARGE
                         Caen?

                                     MILLER
                         I wish.  You and I are taking a squad
                         up to Ramelle on a public relations
                         mission.

                                     SARGE
                         You?  Leading a squad?

                                     MILLER
                         Some private up there lost three
                         brothers, got a ticket home.

                                     SARGE
                         What about the company?

                                     MILLER
                         Simpson.

                                     SARGE
                         Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking
                         pogo stick!

                                     MILLER
                         I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with
                         his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.

                                     SARGE
                         Beasley's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, Wade.  Translators?

                                     SARGE
                         Fresh out.

                                     MILLER
                         What about Talbot?

                                     SARGE
                         Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn,
                         I'll go see if I can find another
                         one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and
                         Wade, meet me at transport.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the
               crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.

               EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY

               Just in from the beaches.  DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS.
               Nothing close.  Dust.  Confusion.  Vehicles of every sort
               moving out.  Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks.  In the middle
               of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-
               shift desk made out of crate.  He yells at a PRIVATE.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT
                         OF THERE!

               Private They're blocked in!

                                     SERGEANT
                         THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!

               SARGE< REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE

               Wait nearby.  Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.
               The others are relaxed.

                                     MILLER
                         Strides through the chaos, avoiding
                         the passing vehicles.  He sees his
                         men and walks toward them.  Reiben
                         hurries up to Miller, pleading.

                                     REIBEN
                         Please, sir, you can't take me to
                         Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir,
                         please, I told you, they make Caen
                         lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's
                         the best there is, it's...oh, please,
                         sir...

                                     MILLER
                         Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're
                         the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (desperate)
                         No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or
                         what about Faulkner?  Or that little
                         guy with the glasses?

                                     MILLER
                         Trust me, you're the best.

                                     REIBEN
                              (whimpering)
                         But, sir...

               Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides
               off toward the Supply Sergeant's table.  Sarge falls in next
               to Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         You get a translator, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I've got a line on one.

                                     TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE
                         Chaos.  Vehicles THUNDERING by.  The
                         Supply Sergeant juggles runners and
                         paperwork.  Miller steps up to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, I need a truck.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how
                         'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top,
                         red with black interior.

                                     MILLER
                         White-walls?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         No white-walls, sir, there's a war
                         on.
                              (to the Private)
                         NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER
                         THERE!
                              (to Miller)
                         I can't help you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         A half-track, anything.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Sorry, sir.  Division is using
                         everything on wheels to get up to
                         Caen.
                              (notices Miller's
                              shoulder patch)
                         How come you guys aren't going?

               Miller ignores the question.  He spies a jeep.

                                     MILLER
                         How about that jeep?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog
                         told me if anyone breathes on it,
                         I'll get busted and if anyone so
                         much as touches it with their little
                         finger, I'll get court marshaled.
                         If you were to take it, they'd shoot
                         me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk
                         all the way up to Ramelle?

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         What's at Ramelle beside a lot of
                         Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going
                         home, if he's alive.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Senator's son?

                                     MILLER
                         No, three brothers of his were killed
                         in action.  Command wants him out of
                         there.

               The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.

                                     SUPPLY SERGEANT
                         Damn...I got a couple brothers...

               Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly.  The Supply
               Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY

               Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep.
               Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam
               of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson
               and Wade are crammed in the back.

               The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL
               GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his
               huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.

                                     GENERAL GAVIN
                         SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY
                         GODDAMNED JEEP!?

               The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns
               to take his lumps.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American
               staging area.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to make one stop.

               Miller points the way for Sarge.

               EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly
               white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles
               and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.
               SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out.

                                     MILLER
                         Wait here.

               He strides into the tent.

               INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
               nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and
               gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,
               detailed work.

               One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
               patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
               glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
               EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
               Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

               Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

               Upham Sir, I'm Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         I understand you speak French and
                         German.

               Upham Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have an accent?

               Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a
               touch of the Bavarian.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, you've been re-assigned to me,
                         we're going to Ramelle.

               Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

               Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.

                                     MILLER
                         That's my understanding.

               Upham Lots of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Do you have a problem with that,
                         Corporal?

               Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I
               translate.

                                     MILLER
                         I need a translator, all mine have
                         been killed.

               Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll come back to you.  Get your
                         gear.

               Upham hesitates.

               Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?

               Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

               Upham I'm writing a book and I...

               Miller's expression gives him his answer.

               Upham Uh, how about a pencil?

                                     MILLER
                         A small one.

               Miller shoos him off.

                                     MILLER
                         Go, go...

               Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

               Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
               others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA
               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
               in military history.

               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered
               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles
               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-
               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships
               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of
               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some
               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny
               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day
               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are
               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
               equipment, bodies.

               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine
               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly
               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in
               the back of the jeep.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, can I ask you a question?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         Where are you planning on putting
                         Private Ryan, sir?

               Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         It's just that it's kind of crowded
                         back here, I was wondering if you're
                         expecting to have more room on the
                         way back?

               Miller points out a turn to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Left.

               Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets
               it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now we've got a straight shot, due
                         north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,
                         two villages between here and there,
                         St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take
                         the jeep as far as we can, then go
                         on on foot.

                                     SARGE
                         We in radio contact with anybody up
                         there?

                                     MILLER
                         Somebody put the wrong crystals in
                         every one of the Hundred-and-First's
                         radios the night before the drop,
                         not one of them works.  We're going
                         in blind.

                                     REIBEN
                         I usually like surprises.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we likely to run into?

                                     MILLER
                         A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut
                         divisions, no fronts, no lines, the
                         drops were completely fouled up,
                         we've got little pockets of
                         paratroopers all over the place,
                         trying to hang on.  Command says we
                         hold St. Mere, but north of that,
                         it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's
                         where he's supposed to be, he's more
                         than likely dead.

                                     SARGE
                         Hell of a mission.

                                     MILLER
                         Yep, hell of a mission.

               IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP

               Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring
               at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful
               smile.

               Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?

               Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an
               insect.

               Upham I'm Upham.

               (pointing at his corporal's stripes)

               Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.
               Their jaws drop.

                                     REIBEN
                              (to Wade)
                         You want to shoot him, or should I?

               Wade It's not my turn.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,
                         Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.

               Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.

               Upham Miller?

                                     MILLER
                         I don't want anybody to shoot him,
                         that's an order.  He speaks French
                         and his German has a touch of the
                         Bavarian.

               Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?

               Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         ...who won the Congressional Medal
                         of Hon...?

               Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
               of Miller's men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
               faced.

               No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as
               if it had never happened.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony
                         of this mission is fucking killing
                         me.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, how so?

                                     REIBEN
                         I should be on my way to Caen, sir.
                         It's like Beethoven, the guy's one
                         of the greatest composers ever lived
                         and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean,
                         who'd he piss off?  And here I am,
                         the Beethoven of ladies foundation
                         garments, one step away from Caen,
                         the center of the known lingerie
                         universe and instead, I'm going to
                         Ramelle to save some fucking private
                         who's probably already dead.

                                     MILLER
                         There's to be a bright side, look
                         for it.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous
                         for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company
                         is going to Caen and we're going to
                         the goddamned cheese capital of
                         France.  There is no bright side.

                                     MILLER
                         There's always a bright side.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm listening, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Well, I, for one, like cheese.

               Wade pipes up cheerfully.

               Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's
               something up there for me to blow up.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, you're a happy idiot.

               THEY ROUND A TURN

               SKID TO A STOP AT A:

               BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES

               A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.

                                     MILLER
                         How's the road up to St. Mere?

               Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding
               somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.

                                     MILLER
                         Anybody getting through?

               Lieutenant The lucky ones.

               Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying
               gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
               down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.
               They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct
               hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.

               AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS

               On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of
               a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham
               grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's
               reaction.

                                     IN THE BACK
                         The men bounce up and down like
                         stuffed animals, doing their best to
                         not be thrown out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, this is better than Coney
                         Island!

                                     A HUGE BUMP
                         Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
                         down on his shovel.  He HOLLERS IN
                         PAIN.

                                     MILLER
                         Just trying to make room for Ryan.

               Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his
               shovel from under his bruised ass.

               THEY ROUND A BEND

               See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,
               obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

               Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER

                                     MILLER
                              (sweetly)
                         Sarge?

               SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.

                                     ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
                         Thirty yards ahead of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Directs Sarge off the road.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got the road zeroed.

                                     SARGE
                         Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep
                         off the road.

                                     THE JEEP BOUNCES
                         Off the shoulder.  Nearly throwing
                         everyone out.  Somehow they hang on.
                         The jeep tears along the rutted field.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Just behind them.

                                     SARGE DRIVES MADLY
                         Not slowing down.  Trying to avoid
                         the biggest ruts and bumps.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Close on their side.  Showers them
                         with debris.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus Christ!

               MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN

               Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

                                     MILLER
                         They've got a hell of a spotter
                         somewhere.

                                     ANOTHER EXPLOSION
                         Even closer.  The jeep's PEPPERED
                         WITH SHRAPNEL.  They BARREL THROUGH
                         the smoke.

                                     MILLER
                         S-curves, Sarge.

                                     SARGE
                         Turns shallow curves without slowing
                         down.

               SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER

               Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned
               earth.  STOPS SHORT.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON

               THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt.

                                     SARGE AND MILLER
                         Hang on.  Stay in the jeep but are
                         battered.  All stunned.  MILLER Is
                         first to regain his bearings.  Jumps
                         up.  Checks out the jeep.  Undamaged.
                         Deep in the soft dirt.

               AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge!  Reverse!

               Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
               The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
               Yells to the others.

                                     MILLER
                         COME ON!  YOU WANNA WALK?

                                     STILL DAZED
                         Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw
                         their heads back on.  Shoulder into
                         the jeep.  Push for all they're worth.
                         The WHEELS STILL SPIN.

               ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT

                                     MILLER IGNORES IT
                         He's the only one who does.

                                     SARGE
                         Captain, they got us zeroed.

               Upham is very nervous.

                                     UPHAM
                         That's bracketing, right?

               They all ignore him.

                                     UPHAM
                         I know about bracketing.  I read
                         about it.  The next one is going to
                         land right on us.

                                     MILLER
                         FORWARD!  FORWARD!
                              (beat)
                         NOW REVERSE!

               Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE.  Rocks it.  SLAMS IT BACK
               INTO FORWARD.  Makes progress.

               ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.  WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     MILLER
                         PUSH!

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, Captain...

                                     THE TIRES SCREAM
                         A bit more progress.  It's almost
                         out.

               THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS

               Knowing the shell is coming any second.  Upham is beside
               himself.

                                     SARGE
                              (sweetly)
                         Oh, Captain...

                                     ONE MORE PUSH
                         The jeep rocks back in, deeper.

                                     MILLER
                         SHIT!

               THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN

                                     MILLER
                         GO!

                                     THE MEN
                         Instantly take off.  Away from the
                         jeep.  As fast as they can.

               THE SHELL SCREAMS IN

               The men hit the dirt.

                                     DIRECT HIT
                         OBLITERATING THE JEEP

                                     THE MEN
                         Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.
                         STUNNED by the concussion.  SHOWERED
                         with dirt, rock and debris.

                                     MILLER
                         Is first up.  Sarge and the men
                         struggle to their feet.  Hear MORE
                         INCOMING.  Miller grabs Upham by the
                         collar and pulls him up.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE COME THE MORTARS!

               THEY ALL TAKE OFF

               Running as fast as they can.

               THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN

               The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.  But
               there must be a dozen mortars firing.  The shells are almost
               constant.

                                     THE FIELD
                         The six Americans run madly, in zig-
                         zag patterns through the gauntlet of
                         MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  BOOM

                                     RUNNING, STUMBLING
                         BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

               UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

               Miller yanks him up.  Half-drags him to the edge of the field.

               THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

               Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards
               in.

                                     THE EXPLOSIONS STOP
                         THE MEN ALL STOP Panting.  Struggling
                         to catch their breath. Check their
                         body parts.  Everything's there.
                         They have their weapons, most of
                         their gear.

               Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is
               nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         General Gavin is going to be very
                         irritated at you, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands on the edge of the woods,
                         almost in a trance.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

                                     SARGE
                         Sssssh!

               Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from
               position to position.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, maps.

               Sarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent,
               frozen in place.

                                     MILLER
                         Two eighty-eights, just under two-
                         and-a-half miles, that way, vector
                         from the jeep, through those two
                         trees at the base of the hill.  The
                         mortars came from behind that rise,
                         there, four of them.

               Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out
               of it.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade, the radio.

               Wade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed.

                                     UPHAM
                         You can tell all that, just by the
                         sound, sire?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not all.  There were nine
                         gunners on the eighty-eights, one
                         had a broken heel on his boot, two
                         had bratwurst for supper last night,
                         one of them is named Fritz, the other,
                         Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard
                         to tell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Corporal, you have just seen one of
                         Captain Miller's many God-given
                         talents.  If, by some miracle, you
                         survive, you will witness many more
                         of them.

               Sarge finished vectoring.

                                     SARGE
                         Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care
                         of those eighty-eights?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not what we're here for.

                                     WADE
                              (re. radio)
                         I've got command, Captain.

               Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                              (into radio)
                         This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,
                         sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-
                         three by baker-three.  Two eighty-
                         eights.  Tell our boys to come in
                         low from the east in case the Krauts
                         have ack-ack.  Good hunting.  Over.

               A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade
               packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir,
               wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.

                                     SARGE
                         He's right, Captain, it might be
                         kind of dangerous for those flyboys.

                                     MILLER
                         Tell that to Private James Ryan.
                         We've got our orders.  Let's go.

               Miller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest
               of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails,
               amazed at Miller.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Miller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in
               alongside Reiben.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     REIBEN
                         Get lost.

               Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.

                                     UPHAM
                         So, where are you from?

                                     JACKSON
                         You writin' a book or somethin'?

                                     UPHAM
                         As a matter of fact, I am.

                                     JACKSON
                         Figured.

               Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.

                                     WADE
                         I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E,
                         I'm small but wiry, with piercing,
                         steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn
                         but handsome face, I'm from Colorado,
                         my father's a mining engineer, don't
                         you take notes?

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         Demolition, right?

                                     WADE
                         Since I was nine years old.  They
                         got a lot of explosives around mines.
                         Me and my little brother could get
                         into any warehouse you ever saw.
                         Damn, we had fun!

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork,
                         Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher.
                         Him and his two brothers got a
                         ministry, The Blessed Church of the
                         Wandering Gospel.

                                     UPHAM
                         In West Fork?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the back of a nineteen and thirty-
                         one stretch Hudson with a big ole'
                         trailer.

                                     UPHAM
                         No kidding.

                                     JACKSON
                         I don't make jokes about things of,
                         or related to, the preaching of the
                         Holy Gospel, including the ministerial
                         calling of my family.

                                     UPHAM
                         So they travel around from place to
                         place and preach?

                                     JACKSON
                         We got us a tent, forty-two feet
                         across, eighteen feet at center,
                         hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.
                         Circuit's eleven towns, covers all
                         'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller
                         County.  I expect that upon completion
                         of my military service I will be
                         joinin' said ministry.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about the Captain?  Where's he
                         from?

               They all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot.

                                     JACKSON
                         You figure that out, you got yourself
                         one nice prize.

                                     SARGE
                         Over three hundred bucks, last I
                         heard.  Wade Company's got a pool,
                         five bucks gets you in, whoever
                         guesses where the Captain's from and
                         what he did as a civilian gets it
                         all.

                                     JACKSON
                         The whole kit and caboodle.

                                     UPHAM
                         But everybody's heard of him, he won
                         the Congressional Medal of Honor, he
                         saved a dozen men.

                                     REIBEN
                         We know.

                                     UPHAM
                         Somebody must know where he's from,
                         what he did for a living.

                                     SARGE
                         Somebody probably does.

                                     UPHAM
                         Why don't you just ask him?

                                     JACKSON
                         The Captain prefers not to discuss
                         certain aspects of his life, in
                         particular, everything up to and
                         including his enlistment in the United
                         States Army.

                                     SARGE
                         I've been with him since Anzio.  I'm
                         closer to him that I am to my own
                         brother but I don't even know what
                         state he's from.  Somewhere in the
                         Northeast as near as I can figure.
                         I don't even have a clue what he did
                         for a living as civilian.

               Reiben shakes his head.

                                     REIBEN
                         No one's gonna win the money for the
                         simple reason that the Captain never
                         was a civilian.  They assembled him
                         at O.C.S. out of spare body parts
                         from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a
                         fact.

                                     JACKSON
                              (defensively)
                         You got somethin' against the Cap'n?

                                     REIBEN
                         Hell, no.  I think he's the best
                         officer in the whole goddamned army,
                         bar none.

               They all nod in assent, no argument there.

                                     JACKSON
                         You got that right.

               Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham
               watches Miller, with even more curiosity.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a
               country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the
               brush.  Miller walks tall now.

                                     JACKSON
                         Captain, my feet are most
                         uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we
                         was gonna have to walk all the way
                         to Ramelle, I never would 'a
                         volunteered for this here mission.

                                     MILLER
                         You didn't volunteer, Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                         I most likely would have, sir, had I
                         been given the opportunity.

                                     REIBEN
                         If we find Ryan and he's still alive,
                         that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry
                         this goddamned B.A.R. back to the
                         beach for me.

                                     JACKSON
                         Army life is too dang easy, my feet
                         have gone soft.  Back home, we go
                         out squirrel huntin', I walk forever
                         and a day and then some, don't even
                         raise a blister.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what a B.A.R. weighs?
                         Nineteen and a half pounds, not
                         counting ammo.
                              (re. ammo bandoleers)
                         And you think these things are
                         comfortable?  They may look good but
                         they weigh twelve pounds each, that's
                         thirty-six pounds, right there.

                                     WADE
                         So what?  I've got three satchel
                         charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen-
                         and-a-half pineapples, and all my
                         regular gear.  You don't hear me
                         complaining.

                                     REIBEN
                         That's because, as I have pointed
                         out on numerous occasions, you are a
                         happy idiot.

                                     WADE
                         No, I just happen to take the
                         Captain's advice and look at the
                         bright side of things.

                                     UPHAM
                         How do you do it?

                                     WADE
                         It's easy, it runs in my family,
                         take my grandfather, for example...

                                     REIBEN
                         Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to
                         that grandfather thing again.

                                     WADE
                         As I was saying, before I was so
                         rudely interrupted, my grandfather
                         got old, as grandfathers tend to do.
                         He needed someone to take care of
                         him.  We move around all the time,
                         going from one mine to another, so
                         we had to put him in a home.  Nice
                         enough place but kind of depressing.
                         But not for Granddad.  He just
                         convinced himself he was on a cruise
                         ship, going to Tahiti, he had his
                         own cabin, first class, with room
                         service.  It just so happened that
                         the weather was always lousy, so he
                         never bothered to go up on deck.
                         Happiest guy you ever saw until the
                         day he died.

                                     UPHAM
                         You think he really believed it?

                                     WADE
                         Who knows?  It worked.

                                     REIBEN
                         Fine, you convince yourself you got
                         a pack full of feathers and goddamned
                         Private James Ryan can carry my
                         fucking gear.

                                     WADE
                         Reiben, you can be very unpleasant
                         to be around sometimes.

                                     REIBEN
                         You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I
                         can do much better than this.

                                     WADE
                         Look at Upham, you don't hear him
                         complaining.

               Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a
               shot.

                                     UPHAM
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I was
                         just thinking...

               The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst.

                                     UPHAM
                              (continuing)
                         That I'm so fucking tired of this
                         goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand
                         dollars to see that bastard Ryan
                         crawl on his belly over an acre of
                         broken glass to hear my great-aunt
                         Martha fart through a field-phone.

               The men are stunned.

                                     REIBEN
                         Jesus Christ, he's a natural!

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, are you sure you've never
                         been in combat?

               Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain
               I'd remember.

               Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.

                                     MILLER
                         He's good.

               They walk on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.

               Miller smiles, situation normal.

               EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
               battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR
               EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers
               crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.

               Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a
               couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across
               and disappear into the remains of a building.

               Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
               corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread
               out down the block behind him.

               Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental
               picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
               an alley across the street and down the block.  They are
               CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.

               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET
               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.

               Miller motions Jackson across first.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay low.

               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,
               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and
               makes it to the cover of the far side.

                                     JACKSON
                         Dang!  That was close!

               Miller nods to Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Your turn.

               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him
               very gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple
                         times, you'll be alright.

               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for
                         you.
                              (sternly)
                         But if I do, you goddamned well better
                         go.

               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.

               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.

                                     MILLER
                         Looks to Upham

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

               Upham nods, still terrified.

               MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN

               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

                                     MILLER
                         Go.

               Upham runs.

               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.

               He doesn't budge.

               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.

               REIBEN watches Upham run.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, that guy can move.

               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to
               the far side.

               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't
               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.
               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.

                                     SARGE
                              (under his breath so
                              only Miller can hear)
                         Damn fool.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, he's fast!

                                     MILLER
                              (glances at Sarge,
                              speaks to Reiben)
                         Glad of it.

                                     UPHAM
                         On the other side of the street,
                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
                         Upham is a bit in shock, less from
                         the nearness of the bullets than
                         from what Miller just did for him.

                                     MILLER
                         DASHES across the street.

               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches
               behind him.

               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Bring 'em over.

               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, I...

               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         One at a time.

                                     MILLER
                         Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-
                         runs down the block.  He passes a:

                                     BOMBED OUT BUILDING
                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen
                         dead American soldiers lined up on
                         the ground.  The battered, bloody
                         bodies, only partially covered by
                         ponchos.

               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no
                         reaction.  Runs to:

                                     AN ALLEY
                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
                         there, out of the line of fire.
                         He's sending off a squad to continue
                         their door-to-door.

               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
               familiarly.

               Captain hamill How was the road in?

                                     MILLER
                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,
                         a nice one, it had a cute little
                         flag with a couple of stars on it.

               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.

                                     MILLER
                         We called in a strike on the eighty-
                         eights that took it out, but it's
                         the Kraut spotter that counts,
                         wherever the hell that bastard is.

               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
               steeple.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson.

               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
               his back.

               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,
               along with Upham, watch curiously.

               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
               is fascinated.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is that?

               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
               shell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel
                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,
                         elevated three-glass scope and a
                         single-throw hammer.

                                     UPHAM
                         The Army gave you that?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep.

                                     UPHAM
                         You must be a hell a shot.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not where I come from.

               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
               and waits, absolutely motionless.

                                     UPHAM
                         That must be four thousand yards.

                                     JACKSON
                              (without taking his
                              eye from the scope)
                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure.

                                     UPHAM
                         You take account of the wind?

               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
               back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
               some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
               Upham and Jackson.

                                     REIBEN
                              (put-on Southern accent)
                         Dang right, he take 'count of the
                         wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a
                         Kentucky windage?

               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
               trigger.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, how many time I got to tell
                         you, I'm from Tennessee.

                                     REIBEN
                         They got squirrels there, too, right?

               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
               the St. Mere road is open.

               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
               Miller.

               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?

                                     MILLER
                         Very far, they're not coming this
                         way, they're going to take Caen first.

               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a
               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it
               gets better.  How many men did you bring?

                                     MILLER
                         Five, but we not staying, we're on
                         our way to Ramelle.

               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private
               Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, you know about that?

               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
               with the early wounded or dead.

               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,
               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.

                                     MILLER
                         Wonderful.

               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the
               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.

                                     MILLER
                         How do we get out of here?

               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
               tomorrow night.

               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
               head.

               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

               Miller shrugs.

               Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but
               I understand what you're doing?

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?

               Captain hamill Good luck.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks.

               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
               sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's find someplace to hole up.

               Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head
               of the alley, Miller passes Upham.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         It was nothing.

                                     UPHAM
                         But you could have gotten killed and
                         I...

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         Like I said, it was nothing.
                              (to the men)
                         Don't bunch up.

               He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham
               watches him go.

                                     UPHAM
                         Did you see what he did, back there?
                         He stepped right into the open, so I
                         could get across.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shit, that was no big deal.

                                     WADE
                         They can't kill him.

                                     SARGE
                         Like hell they can't.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade's right, it's some kind of
                         scientific, magnetic thing, I can't
                         explain it, but I've seen it.

                                     WADE
                         We all have, he's got nine lives, or
                         he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.

               The men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is
               neither.

                                     SARGE
                         No one's bulletproof.  No one.
                              (beat)
                         C'mon, stay low.

               Sarge takes off after Miller.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

               Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins
               of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable
               spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.
               Reiben paces.

                                     REIBEN
                         Captain, could you please explain
                         the math of this mission to me?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, what do you want to know?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,
                         since when does six equal one?  What's
                         the sense in risking six guys to
                         save one?

                                     MILLER
                         Ours is not to reason why.

                                     REIBEN
                         Huh?

                                     MILLER
                         Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick
                         up this kid, high-tail it back to
                         division, everything'll work out
                         fine.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'd much rather die in Caen than
                         Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, there's a fairly good chance
                         you're not going to die at all.

                                     REIBEN
                         Easy for you to say, sir.
                              (beat)
                         Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring
                         his fucking neck.

                                     SARGE
                         Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor
                         bastard's mother.

                                     REIBEN
                         Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you
                         got a mother?

                                     JACKSON
                         Last I knew.

                                     REIBEN
                         Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of
                         us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain
                         has a mother.

               Miller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, maybe not the Captain, but the
                         rest of us have mothers.

                                     MILLER
                         You have orders, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

                                     MILLER
                         I'd love to hear it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is
                         a serious misallocation of valuable
                         military resources.  Miller Go on.

                                     JACKSON
                         Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am
                         a finely made instrument of warfare.
                         What I mean by that is, if you was
                         to put me with this here sniper rifle
                         anywhere up to and includin' one
                         mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear
                         line of sight, war's over.

               Miller nods.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I want you to listen closely
                         to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe.
                         Jackson, continue.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that
                         the entire resources of the United
                         States Army oughta be dedicated to
                         one thing and one thing only, and
                         that is to put me and this here weapon
                         on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle
                         of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one
                         to question decisions made up on
                         high, sir, but it seems to me that
                         saving one private, no matter how
                         grievous the losses of his family,
                         is a waste of my God-given talent.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade?

                                     WADE
                         Hell, I don't mind this mission,
                         sir, as long as there's something up
                         at Ramelle for...

                                     REIBEN
                              (finishing Wade's
                              sentence)
                         ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,
                         we heard that.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?

                                     UPHAM
                         Pass.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?

                                     SARGE
                         I'm just here to keep a bunch of
                         numb-nuts, including one certain,
                         frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,
                         from getting themselves killed.

               Reiben eyes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         And what about you, Captain?

               Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, what's the matter with you?
                         I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain.
                         There's a chain of command.  Griping
                         goes one way, up, only up, never
                         down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to
                         my superior officers.  Up, get it?
                         I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe
                         in front of you.  How long you been
                         in the army?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.
                              (beat)
                         But if you weren't a captain, or if
                         I were a major, what would you say?

               Miller considers his response.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case, I would say this is an
                         excellent mission, with an extremely
                         valuable objective, worthy of my
                         best efforts.

               Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no
               obvious sarcasm.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         In addition, as I pointed out earlier,
                         I have a fondness for cheese and I
                         hope to have the opportunity to sample
                         some of the Ramelle products, when
                         we arrive there, to see if they live
                         up to their excellent reputation.
                         Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
                         for the mother of Private James Ryan
                         and I'm more than willing to lay
                         down my life, and the lives of my
                         men, especially you, Reiben, to help
                         relieve her suffering.  The men
                         thoroughly enjoy the performance.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, if you were not a captain, I
                         would compliment you, now, for being
                         an excellent liar.

                                     MILLER
                         But I am a captain.  If I were not a
                         captain, I would thank you for the
                         compliment and tell you that the
                         ability to lie comes from being a
                         top-notch poker player, which I am,
                         having learned at the side of my
                         mother who is, by popular acclaim,
                         the best poker player in...

               The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're
               about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         ...my home town, which shall remain
                         un-named.

               The men ease back, disappointed.

                                     MILLER
                         Any further thoughts on the subject?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like
                         to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,
                         fuck the cheese capital of France
                         and while we're at it, fuck Private
                         James Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll make a note of your suggestions
                         but I'll leave that last one to you,
                         especially if he's already dead.

               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets
               serious.

                                     MILLER
                         We move out in two hours, try and
                         get some sleep.

               The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all
               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange
               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
               suit.

               Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his
               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,
               he studies his maps while his men rest.

               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)

               Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,
               Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his
               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,
               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.

                                     SARGE
                         You ever going to open those letters?
                         Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe.

                                     SARGE
                         It's not normal, not reading letters
                         from home.

                                     MILLER
                         Since when have things been normal?

                                     SARGE
                         You got me.  Afraid of bad news?

                                     MILLER
                         Nope.

                                     SARGE
                         Good news?

               Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of
               them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at
               the men.

                                     SARGE
                         You think they'll be alright?

                                     MILLER
                         They're fine.  As long as they can
                         gripe, they'll be alright.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about you?

               Miller considers the question, doesn't answer.

                                     MILLER
                         They guys here aren't going to be
                         able to hold out until battalion
                         shows up.

                                     SARGE
                         Nope.

                                     MILLER
                         Command isn't going to let them
                         withdraw and the Germans sure as
                         hell aren't going to let them
                         surrender.

                                     SARGE
                         Three for three.

                                     MILLER
                         If we stayed, we could make a
                         difference.

                                     SARGE
                         You're kidding yourself.

                                     MILLER
                         You never know.

               They sit in silence for a moment.

                                     SARGE
                         I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.

                                     MILLER
                         Now you're the one kidding yourself.
                              (beat)
                         Hell of  a mission.

                                     SARGE
                         Yup, hell of a mission.

               Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Rise and shine, boys.  Let's go.

               Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their
               gear.

               EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT

               SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY
               BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral
               toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,
               but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are
               very formidable-looking.

               EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill
               and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:

               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The
               AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
               countryside like a tidal wave.

               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.

               IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY
               is incredible, strange, other-worldly.

               EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.

               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.

               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.

               SARGE notices, says nothing.

               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes
               go back to the BLAZING SKY.

                                     SARGE
                              (awe-struck)
                         Makes you feel small, doesn't it?

                                     MILLER
                         It doesn't take this.

               Upham's face shows more fear than awe.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wasn't made for this.

                                     MILLER
                              (bitterly)
                         You think the rest of us were?

               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
               hold of himself and speaks gently.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect
                         you, this shit's gonna keep him up
                         all night, anyway.

               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, this ain't what they pay
                         us for.

               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points
               the way.

               Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a
               gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until
               you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.

               As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to
               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to
               Reiben.

               Gentle-faced private Here.

               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-
               ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's
               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

               Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at
               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.

               Reiben takes the ammo.

                                     REIBEN
                              (gently)
                         Just what I need.

               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands
               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks, but you may need these more
                         than us, or Ryan.

               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
               the ammo back.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's move out.

               Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,
               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill
               and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a
               strange bit of hope.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT

               The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The
               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.
               Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         A couple of weeks.  It started in
                         Portsmouth when they brought us down
                         for loading.

                                     SARGE
                         Is it getting worse?

                                     MILLER
                         No.  It comes and goes.  It stops
                         when I look at it.

                                     SARGE
                         You may have to find yourself a new
                         line of work, this one doesn't seem
                         to agree with you anymore.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll be alright.

               Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk
               on.

               EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)

               Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at
               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge
               brings up the rear.

               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate
               only with hand signals.

               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease
               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
               MEN appear.

               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
               go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of
               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed
               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.

               THE GERMANS PASS.

               MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh
               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
               exposed.  Shitting bricks.

               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad
               approaches.

               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-
               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries
               after Miller, staying close on his heels.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,
               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

               Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as
               Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
               signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn
               is visible.

                                     MILLER
                         It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it
                         up.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

               First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by
               the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.

               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.
               The war is far away.

               Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together
               without speaking for a moment.

                                     MILLER
                         It looks like a Renoir.

                                     UPHAM
                         Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth
                         Symphony, The Normandy?

                                     MILLER
                         I've been humming it.

                                     UPHAM
                         I heard.

                                     MILLER
                         It seemed appropriate.

                                     UPHAM
                         You know classical music?

                                     MILLER
                         Some.

                                     UPHAM
                         Where are you from, Captain?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the pool up to?

               Upham smiles, caught.

                                     UPHAM
                         Over three-hundred.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll tell you what, if I'm still
                         alive when it hits five-hundred,
                         I'll let you know and we'll split
                         the money.

                                     UPHAM
                         If that's the way you feel, why don't
                         we wait until it's up to a thousand.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't expect to live that long.

               Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five hundred, then.

               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself
               back into a commander and barks at Upham.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's go, private.

               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure
               him out, then he simply follows him.

               EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN

               The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is
               lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,
               hundred of years old.

               Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They
               advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.
               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a
               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
               empty shell casings around his body.

               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to
               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
               gently to him in French.

               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands
               and translates.

                                     UPHAM
                         Five nights ago, he found this
                         paratrooper caught in a tree with a
                         broken leg.  The leg got infected.
                         Last night he went to Ville Cholet
                         to get a doctor.  The doctor refused
                         to come and when he got back, this
                         is what he found.  The Krauts must
                         have shown up while he was gone.

                                     MILLER
                         Did he see any sign of them?

               Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.

                                     UPHAM
                         No, but he heard firing, just east,
                         less that a kilometer.

                                     MILLER
                         Thank him and tell him we're sorry
                         about his loss.

               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.
               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.

               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

               A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last
               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
               edge of the field.

               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches
               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to
               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with
               bullets.

               Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.

                                     WADE
                         Captain.

               Staying low, they join Wade who has found:

               TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS

               A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.

               MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON

               Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The
               others crawl up behind them.

                                     MILLER
                         Where?

                                     JACKSON
                         In the shadow by those two trees.

                                     MILLER
                         My guess, too.

                                     UPHAM
                         What is it?

                                     MILLER
                         A machine gun.

               Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover
               of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, I've got an idea, let's go
                         around.

                                     MILLER
                         We can't leave it here.

                                     JACKSON
                         We left them eighty-eights.

                                     MILLER
                         They don't send planes to put out
                         machine guns.
                              (beat)
                         Two flank runners with surpressing
                         fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes
                         left has to be fast.

               Upham steels himself and steps forward.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.

                                     REIBEN
                         He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

               Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.

                                     WADE
                         How fast?

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-four-five.

                                     WADE
                         Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-
                         two flat.

                                     MILLER
                         Wade goes left.

               Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is
               impressed.

                                     UPHAM
                         Twenty-two flat?

               Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.

                                     WADE
                         I would have won the states if some
                         bastard hadn't tripped me in the
                         finals.

               Miller points the others to their firing positions.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, Upham, here.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         ten yards, either side.

               As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,
               out of earshot of the men.

                                     SARGE
                         Rule of thumb, Captain, says you
                         ought to detail this one, instead of
                         going yourself.

               Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?

                                     SARGE
                         How about I go right, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         How about you take your position?

               Sarge hesitates.

                                     SARGE
                         How about...?

                                     MILLER
                              (interrupting)
                         How about you shut up and take your
                         position?

               Sarge nods.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near
               Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.

                                     UPHAM
                         Good luck, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got
                         five lives.

                                     UPHAM
                         The men said, nine.

                                     MILLER
                         What do they know?
                              (beat)
                         I had nine, but I feel through the
                         ice when I was seven, my brother
                         pulled me out.  Then I used one when
                         a grenade landed in my foxhole in
                         Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one
                         on the beaches, one on the cliffs
                         and two getting here.

                                     UPHAM
                         That only leaves three.

                                     MILLER
                         Plenty.

               Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Ready?

                                     WADE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.

               MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.

               Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a
               moment.  Then:

               A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.

               SHATTERING THE QUIET.

                                     IN THE NEST
                         A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING
                         THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE
                         8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.
                         Four Germans in the nest, four more
                         outlying riflemen.

                                     MILLER
                         Takes the FIRST FIRE.  He HITS THE
                         DIRT.  The BULLETS SCREAM just over
                         him.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS
               WADE HITS THE DIRT

               The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.

               SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM

               Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS
               THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND
               SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT

               Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.

                                     SARGE
                         FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.
                         No effect.  Pissed.  POPS THE CLIP.
                         SLAMS in another.  FIRES.

               THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER

               He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.

                                     WADE
                         Ten more yards.  Too slow.  A deadly
                         row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward
                         him.

                                     MILLER
                         Makes it to the far side.  Scrambles
                         up the roots.  Dives through the
                         brush.

                                     WADE
                         On a slight rise.  Can't hit the
                         dirt.  A line of bullets.  Desperately
                         sprints.

               WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.
               Goes down.

               SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
                         Stumbles onto the path.  Rolls to
                         his feet, running.  Swings his
                         Thompson into firing position.  Racing
                         toward the nest.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.

                                     MILLER
                         Tearing along the path.  Sees a German
                         rifleman.  FIRES A BURST.  CUTS HIM
                         DOWN.  Runs over the body without
                         breaking stride.

               SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN
               FIRE from Miller.

               The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow
               he's not hit.

                                     MILLER
                         TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.  BLASTS his
                         Thompson.  CUTS DOWN two more German
                         riflemen.  Grabs a grenade.  Pulls
                         the pin.

                                     THE NEST
                         The Germans see Miller coming.  Wheel
                         from Sarge.  Too late.

                                     MILLER
                         THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.

               THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are
               KILLED.

               SARGE hollers to the others.

                                     SARGE
                         HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                                     MILLER
                         Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another
                         BURST.  KILLS the last of the German
                         riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto
                         the field.

               SARGE AND THE OTHERS

               See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto
               the field.

                                     WADE
                         Lies in the grass.  Holding his belly.
                         Astonished by the pain.

               ALL THE AMERICANS RUN

               Converging on Wade.  Miller points, and yells, without slowing
               down.

                                     MILLER
                         REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER!  COVER!

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Stop instantly.  Turn toward the
                         perimeter of the field.

                                     SARGE
                         Roots through his medical kit as he
                         runs.  Dropping and scattering
                         inessentials behind him.

                                     WADE
                         Wide-eyed.  Not even writhing.  Too
                         much pain.

               MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE

               Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both
               tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping
               one open.  Powder spills.

               REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.

                                     SARGE
                         Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
                         Pours sulfa powder.

                                     MILLER
                         About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the
                         wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.

                                     MILLER
                         Damn it!

               Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.

                                     SARGE
                         Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.

                                     SARGE
                         Sulfa, more sulfa...

                                     WADE
                         Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller.
                         Sees him preparing the morphine shot.
                         They both know.

                                     WADE
                         Yeah...morphine...make it a
                         double...huh...Captain...?

                                     MILLER
                         SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
                         Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine
                         straight to Wade's brain.  Motions
                         impatiently to Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         More morphine, hurry up, come on,
                         come on...

                                     SARGE
                         Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa.
                         Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the
                         morphine.

                                     MILLER
                         Snatches the morphine from Sarge.
                         Quickly and efficiently prepares a
                         second shot.  He's done this before.

                                     REIBEN
                         On guard, glancing back.  Pissed
                         off.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     UPHAM
                         Freaked out.  Trying to keep his
                         eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.

                                     JACKSON
                         Watching.

                                     MILLER
                         Gives Wade the second shot.

                                     WADE
                         Feels the effects of the first shot.
                         He sees Upham and manages a pained
                         smile.

               WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,
               without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE
               DIES

               ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE

               UPHAM begins to weep.

               REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently
                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers
                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades
                         dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.
                         Sarge notices.

               Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
               see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.

               Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,
               rises and picks up his Thompson.

               Upham shakes his head.

                                     UPHAM
                         That was no twenty-two flat.

               Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.

                                     MILLER
                         He lied.  Let's move out.

               Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men
               hesitate, then slowly follow him.

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY

               A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.
               The five G.I.'s walk, spread out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,
                         just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-
                         bitch.

                                     JACKSON
                         Shut up, will you?

                                     REIBEN
                         You shut up, this is the most fucked
                         up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned
                         Ryan, fuck the little bastard.

                                     JACKSON
                         Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         The hell he didn't.

               Miller motions to them curtly.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep it down.

               They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,
               the men don't hear.

                                     MILLER
                         We've got to find someplace to hole
                         up for a bit.

               Sarge looks at Miller closely.

                                     SARGE
                         You alright?

                                     MILLER
                         Let's just find someplace.

               EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY

               Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good
               hiding place.

                                     MILLER
                         Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,
                         perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.
                         I'm going to re-con.

               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but
               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.
               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.

               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY

               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The
               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,
               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for
               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,
               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,
               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller
               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a
               thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.

                                     MILLER
                         What was the name of that kid at
                         Anzio, the one who got his face burned
                         off?

                                     SARGE
                         Vecchio.

                                     MILLER
                         Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember
                         his name, he was a good kid, remember
                         how he used to walk on his hands and
                         sing that song about the man on flying
                         trapeze?

                                     SARGE
                         Yeah.

                                     MILLER
                         You know why I'm such a good officer?
                         Because of my mother.  Have I ever
                         told you about her?

                                     SARGE
                         Bits and pieces.

                                     MILLER
                         She's the best poker player you ever
                         saw.  My father used to go to these
                         Saturday night games and lose his
                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him
                         an ultimatum, either she gets a
                         regular seat at the table or she
                         locks him in every Saturday night.
                         He squawked and so did his buddies
                         but after a while they gave in and
                         from the first night she sat down,
                         she never lost.  She could read those
                         cocky bastards like they were playing
                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her
                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
                         her coffee, she was a master.  She
                         won more money on shit hands than
                         anyone in the history of the game.
                         Every Saturday night, my father would
                         lose two, three hundred bucks and
                         she'd win it all back and then some.
                         And I'd stand there, glued to her
                         shoulder, from the time I was five
                         years old, watching every hand, every
                         move, studying how she did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's why I'm such a good officer,
                         I can look at a man's face and tell
                         you exactly what he's holding, and
                         if it's a shit hand, I know just
                         what cards to deal him.

                                     SARGE
                         And what about your own hand?

                                     MILLER
                         No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?
                         So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear
                         me apart when I'd get one of my men
                         killed, but what was I supposed to
                         do?  Break down in front of the ones
                         who were standing there waiting for
                         me to tell them what to do?  Of course
                         not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
                         I started to fall for my own bluff.
                         It was great, it made everything so
                         much easier.  Sarge Is that why your
                         hand's been shaking?

                                     MILLER
                         It could be worse.  You know the
                         first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
                         Lie to your men.

                                     SARGE
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     MILLER
                         Not in so many words, but they tell
                         you you can have all the firepower
                         in the world and if your men don't
                         have good morale, it's not worth a
                         damn.  So if you're scared or empty
                         or half-a-step from a Section Eight,
                         do you tell your men?  Of course
                         not.  You bluff, you lie.

                                     SARGE
                         And how do you bluff yourself?

                                     MILLER
                         Simple, numbers.  Every time you
                         kill one of your men, you tell
                         yourself you just saved the lives of
                         two, three, ten, a hundred others.
                         We lost, what, thirty-one on the
                         cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times
                         that number by putting out those
                         guns.  That's over three hundred
                         men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.
                         Then thousand.  Any number you want.
                         See?  It's simple.  It lets you always
                         choose mission over men.

                                     SARGE
                         Except this time, the mission IS a
                         man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's
                         Ryan?  If they're both standing in
                         front of me and I have to shoot one
                         or the other, how do I choose?  Look
                         at my hand, there it goes again.

                                     SARGE
                         John, I've got to tell you, I think
                         you're about used up.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you're right, Keith.

                                     SARGE
                         You want me to take over?

               The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He
               looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.

                                     MILLER
                         No, but if I get any worse, you'll
                         have to relieve me.

                                     SARGE
                              (sighs)
                         Just what I want to do.

               They share a smile.

                                     MILLER
                         You know Wade was the eleventh of
                         the twelve, you're the last one still
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         I know.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't let yourself get killed, if
                         you do, they might make me give back
                         the medal and then I won't be able
                         to lip off to colonels anymore.

                                     SARGE
                         I'll do my best.

               They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller
               Hell of a...

                                     (BEAT)
                         Ah, forget it.

               Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting
               himself.  He's about ninety-five percent there.

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks for drawing that machine gun
                         off me.

                                     SARGE
                         You're welcome, John.

                                     MILLER
                         But, that's my personal brand of
                         stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary
                         about it, if you do it again, you're
                         busted.

               Sarge allows himself a slight smile.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back
               to the men.

               EXT. CLEARING - DAY

               The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.
               No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.
               Miller barks at the men.

                                     MILLER
                         Up.  We're moving out.

                                     REIBEN
                         I thought you said we had an hour,
                         sir?

                                     MILLER
                         Well now I'm saying we're moving
                         out.  Get off your ass.

               The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow.

                                     MILLER
                         What the hell's the matter with you,
                         Jackson?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on
                         account of Wade.

                                     MILLER
                         Who's Wade?

               No one responds.

                                     MILLER
                         I said, who the hell is Wade?

               The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand what you're doin',
                         but I respectfully request permission
                         to grieve in my own manner.

                                     MILLER
                         You'll grieve the way I tell you to
                         goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,
                         there was one, but he died a long
                         time ago, he's been dead for so long
                         you can hardly remember his name,
                         you understand?

                                     JACKSON
                         Sir, I understand.  I don't like it,
                         but I understand.

                                     MILLER
                         Good, now get your goddamned gear.

               The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.
               Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his
               head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit
               to work.  He knows they have no choice.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,
               grim.

               EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY

               Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds
               up the map, points the way and they move out.

               EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY

               More progress.  The men are still grim.

                                     REIBEN
                         You know what the best possible thing
                         that could happen is?

                                     JACKSON
                         Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get
                         lockjaw, never say another word as
                         long as you live.

               Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben.

                                     REIBEN
                         I've given this a lot of thought,
                         sir.  The best thing that could happen
                         is, we find Ryan and he's dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Why's that?

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, sir, consider the possibilities.
                         A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take
                         him back to the beach.  Knowing you,
                         you don't let him carry my gear,
                         even though he really should, and we
                         all get killed, trying to keep him
                         alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Except for the last part, that one's
                         not bad.

                                     REIBEN
                         B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown
                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,
                         whose name I know you don't want me
                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.
                         The biggest piece is the size of a
                         pea.  We wander around, looking for
                         him until the Germans pick us off,
                         one after another.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't like that one.

                                     REIBEN
                         Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is
                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's
                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry
                         my gear, we have to carry his gear.
                         And him.

                                     MILLER
                         But we accomplish the mission.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe.  But what if he dies on the
                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,
                         sir?  The best possible situation
                         is, he's dead, we find his body,
                         more or less intact, we grab one of
                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back
                         to the beach, or better yet, we head
                         over to Caen and catch up with
                         division.

                                     MILLER
                         Has anyone ever told you, you're
                         officer material?

                                     REIBEN
                         No, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         That's a mystery to me.

               No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.

               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

               The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush
               near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  "Ramelle 3 Km."  Miller
               folds up the map.

                                     SARGE
                         Looks like we're going to beat those
                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.

               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something
               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they
               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't think so.

               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop
               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack
               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a
               bridge.

               CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL

               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

                                     GERMAN FLANK SQUADS
                         Hurry along the fields on either
                         side of the road, trying to keep up
                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS
                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten
                         themselves into the mucky water.
                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to
                         fire.

                                     THE GERMAN SQUAD
                         Approaches the bridge.

               PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES

               See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.

                                     MILLER
                         Is just about to open up on them.

                                     THE GERMAN SERGEANT
                         Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind
                         and CALLS to them.

                                     THE GERMAN PRIVATES
                         Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the
                         convoy.

                                     IN THE CULVERT
                         The Americans breathe again.

                                     UPHAM
                         I wonder where they're going.

                                     MILLER
                         Same place we are.

               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast
               is clear.  They head out.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY

               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,
               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone
               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.

               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.

               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Scans the Germans with his binoculars.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like tea time, maybe they're
                         Brits.

                                     UPHAM
                         I sure hope so.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think they're waiting
                         for, Captain?

               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
               that sound, they don't like it.

               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,
               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two
               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
               There are four of them.

                                     MILLER
                         Puts away the binoculars and jerks
                         his head for his men to follow, low,
                         along the wall.  The men are happy
                         to do so, looking back nervously at
                         the German tanks.

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY

               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is
               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell
               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French
               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
               the firing.

               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He
               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
               firing.

               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings
               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on
               both sides of the bridge.

               MILLER AND HIS MEN

               Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the
               bridge.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like they've been having a
                         hell of a party, here, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

               A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.

                                     MILLER
                         YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF
                         A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

                                     VOICE FROM BRIDGE
                         WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?

               Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty.

                                     MILLER
                         I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE
                         COME.
                              (to his men)
                         Cover me.

                                     REIBEN
                         What if our guys open up, sir?

                                     MILLER
                         You're only allowed to shoot at
                         Germans, that's one of the rules.

                                     REIBEN
                         Have it your way, Captain.

               Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward
               the bridge.

               THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

               Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         POUR FIRE at the German positions,
                         SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.

                                     ON THE BRIDGE
                         The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM
                         OF BULLETS at the German positions.

               Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
               jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
               young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are
               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller
               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to
               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.

                                     MILLER
                         I'll keep it in mind.
                              (calls to Sarge)
                         OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.

               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
               they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

               Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to
               hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.

                                     MILLER
                         Things are tough all over.  We're
                         looking for a Private James Ryan.

               Forrest Ryan?

                                     MILLER
                         Is he here?

               Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

               Forrest Go get Ryan.

                                     (TO MILLER)
                         What do you want him for, sir?

               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and
               scrambles to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson, get a hold of command.

               Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to
               Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         How many men do you have?

               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
               to leap over the barricade.

               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge
               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

               Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's
               hailing I.D.   No response.

                                     JACKSON
                         Not yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Keep trying.

               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

                                     PRIVATE JAMES RYAN
                         Dashing from cover to cover, making
                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an
                         American classic, nineteen years
                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.
                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and
                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's
                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his
                         face has a spark.  You can't help
                         but love this kid.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         All watch Ryan run toward them.

                                     JACKSON
                         So, that's Ryan.

                                     REIBEN
                         Looks like a flaming asshole to me.

               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
               barricade.  He salutes Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see
                         me?

               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,
               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers
               have been killed in action.

               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
               Somehow he remains upright.

               Ryan All three?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes.

               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning
               him against some sandbags.

                                     THE PARATROOPERS
                         Are stunned at the news.  They look
                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they
                         can do.

                                     MILLER'S MEN
                         Also look at Ryan, but then, one
                         after another, they turn away,
                         adverting their eyes, looking a their
                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,
                         the sky, anything other than Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         We've been sent to get you out of
                         here.  You're going home.

               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a
               little room.

               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.

                                     MILLER
                         Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm
                         taking you and your men with me.

               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this
               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
               ninth Division.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.

               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm not going to leave you and your
                         men here to get killed.  Get them
                         together, we're moving out.

               A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.

                                     RYAN (O.S.)
                         No, sir.

               They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about
               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
               the arm and speaks softly to him.

                                     MILLER
                         Come on, Private, you're going home.

               Ryan jerks away from Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         No, sir.

               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.

                                     MILLER
                         Private.  I'm sorry about your
                         brothers but staying here and getting
                         yourself killed isn't going to help.

                                     RYAN
                         Sir, if the Krauts are holding this
                         bridge when division shows up, our
                         guys are going to be sitting ducks.

                                     MILLER
                         This bridge cannot be held.  The
                         Germans have two companies less than
                         three miles from here.  They have
                         tanks.

               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

                                     MILLER
                         Private, if you want to commit
                         suicide, that's your choice, but
                         you're going to have to wait until
                         after I get you back to the beach.
                         And you're not going to take these
                         men with you.

               Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm not leaving, sir.

               Miller starts to boil over.

                                     MILLER
                         The hell you aren't, you're comin'
                         with me if I have to drag you every
                         inch of the way.  You hear me,
                         Private?

                                     RYAN
                         I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
               resist.

                                     MILLER
                         Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
                         you're coming with me or
                         I'll...I'll...

               Ryan speaks softly.

                                     RYAN
                         What are you going to do, sir, shoot
                         me?

               Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind
               Miller.

                                     REIBEN
                              (politely)
                         Uh, excuse me, Captain.

               Miller slowly turns and glares.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         So, what are a few tanks, sir?

               Miller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                              (continuing)
                         He's right, we can't shoot him...well,
                         we could but we'd get in an enormous
                         amount of trouble.  And he's right
                         about the bridge, it's a hell of a
                         lot more important than he is.

               JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.

                                     JACKSON
                         Cap'n...?

               Miller turns his glare on Jackson.

                                     JACKSON
                              (continuing)
                         Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,
                         here, to kill two birds with one
                         stone.  Command seems to think keepin'
                         this boy alive is worth somethin'.
                         If we was to do that and hold this
                         bridge, good chance we'd get us a
                         bucket full of medals.  I might even
                         get me one 'a them big, fancy ones
                         like you got, so's I could sass any
                         officer in the whole dang army, you
                         included.

               Miller does a slow burn.

               UPHAM STEPS FORWARD

                                     UPHAM
                         I'd like to stay, too, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         You don't count.

               SARGE STEPS UP

                                     SARGE
                         I do and personally, I'd rather get
                         the hell out of here, but somebody's
                         got to stay and take care of you and
                         these pin-head privates of yours.

               Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.

               Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir.

               Reiben smiles.

                                     REIBEN
                         See, Captain?  The vote's unanimous.

               Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote?
               What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This
               isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you
               follow them.  We don't vote!

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely
                         speaking hypothetically.  IF this
                         was a voting situation, then the
                         vote would have been unanimous.  But
                         of course, it's not a voting
                         situation, you're the captain, and
                         you give the orders, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         You're goddamned right, I give the
                         order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen
                         to me, you little pissant pieces of
                         shit, I am the ranking officer here
                         and what I say goes, is that clear?

               They all quickly nod.

                                     JACKSON
                         Yes, sir.

                                     REIBEN
                         Of course, sir.

               All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

               Miller looks from face to face.

                                     MILLER
                         In that case...
                              (beat)
                         I vote we stay.

               That's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them
               time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, the B.A.R., there.  Jackson,
                         get up on the bridgekeepers hut with
                         your sniper rifle.  Sarge, you and
                         Upham move that machine gun so it
                         can cover the left flank, it's
                         worthless where it is.  Forrest, I
                         want a full inventory of all your
                         weapons, ammo and ordnance.  Go.

               They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller
               for a moment.

                                     RYAN
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     MILLER
                              (gruffly gentle)
                         Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next
                         to me, no matter where I go, you
                         understand?

               Ryan salutes.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, come with me.

               Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check
               the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

               Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other
               paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.

               Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon
               grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy
               guns and about sixty rounds per man.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it?

               Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sir, can I change my vote?

               Miller sighs, worried.

               EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY

               Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a
               crescent of sandbags.  His eye is at his scope.  He FIRES.

                                     A GERMAN SNIPER
                         Falls from a window on the edge of
                         town, dead.

                                     UPHAM
                         Sits beside Jackson with a pair of
                         binoculars, searching for another
                         target.  The German sniper fire has
                         subsided for now.  Ext. bridge - day
                         Miller watches as Ryan and several
                         other paratroopers dig a series of
                         trenches across the street, leading
                         to the bridge.

               Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.

               Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head.  He speaks
               to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge, see what you can do to make
                         those buildings inhospitable.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE
               DISTANCE.  They all turn at the sound.

                                     UPHAM
                         Eighty-eights, right?

               Miller nods.

                                     UPHAM
                         I can tell what the gunners had for
                         dinner.

                                     MILLER
                         Those guns are close.

               Forrest Just south of town.  The Krauts have a two gun
               emplacement, we saw it on the way in.  That's how we knew
               they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out
               of us.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope they don't change their
                         mind.

               Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.

               INT. BUILDING - DAY

               Within sight of the bridge.  Sarge carefully plants a wire-
               triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.  He
               sets the wire, then carefully backs away.

               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

               Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine
               gun nest.  Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham
               at his side.

                                     SARGE
                         What do you think?

                                     MILLER
                         Well, if we had ten times the men
                         and a lot more ammo, we might stand
                         a chance, but not against those tanks.

                                     SARGE
                         What are we going to do?

                                     MILLER
                         We're going to hope like hell the
                         tanks were on their way somewhere
                         else.

                                     REIBEN
                         Maybe Caen.

                                     MILLER
                         Let's hope, because we're sure as
                         hell not going to do any damage to
                         them with what we have here.

                                     UPHAM
                         What about our grenades?

                                     MILLER
                         Those are Tigers, they have six-inch
                         armor, they don't even notice
                         grenades.

                                     UPHAM
                         Would they notice and eighty-eight?

                                     MILLER
                         Sure, you got one?

                                     UPHAM
                         The Germans do.

               Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are
                         going hunting.

               Upham runs off.  Sarge shakes his head.

                                     SARGE
                         Uh, oh.

                                     MILLER
                         Out of the mouth of babes.

               EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT

               Dark.  Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with
               blackening soot.  The rest of Miller's men and several
               paratroopers, including Ryan, look on.  Upham is distressed.
               Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.

                                     MILLER
                         Upham, you've got to learn the
                         difference between whining and
                         griping.  You can't just rely on
                         natural ability, you've got to study
                         and practice.

                                     UPHAM
                         But, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         There you go again, that's whining,
                         that's not okay.

                                     UPHAM
                         Goddamn it, sir...

                                     MILLER
                         That's better, but you've still got
                         a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben,
                         he's a natural and works at it, he'll
                         give you some pointers.

                                     REIBEN
                         Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have
                         him pissing and moaning with the
                         best of us.

                                     MILLER
                         See to it.

               RYAN Steps up to Miller.

                                     RYAN
                         I'd like to go, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         No, private, I want you to stay here,
                         keep your head down, don't do anything
                         brave or stupid.

                                     REIBEN
                         Aren't they the same thing, sir?

               Miller smiles.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben, I don't know what I'd do
                         without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close
                         to you and alive.

                                     SARGE
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.

                                     MILLER
                         You ready?

               Forrest Yes, sir.

                                     JACKSON
                         You betcha, sir.

               Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.

                                     REIBEN
                              (southern accent)
                         Y'all come back.

                                     JACKSON
                         Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the
                         way I talk?

                                     REIBEN
                              (heavy southern accent)
                         Hell, no!

               Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest
               into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the
               night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads.

                                     IN THE DARKNESS
                         A slight movement.  It's Miller.  He
                         crawls to the edge of the emplacement
                         and freezes in the shadows.

               A moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that,
               Jackson silently crawls up to them.

                                     MILLER
                         Eyes the emplacement.  Looks for a
                         weakness.  There is none.  He motions
                         to Forrest and Jackson to wait.  The
                         three of them settle into the
                         darkness.

               EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan
               is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's
               men eye him.

                                     SARGE
                         Private, I'm sorry about your
                         brothers.

               Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip
               from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was
               the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?

                                     SARGE
                         Wade.

                                     RYAN
                         Wade.  Huh, he died coming up here
                         to keep me alive...I never met
                         him...he didn't know me from Adam,
                         strange.  What was he like?

                                     SARGE
                         A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,
                         here, used to call him a happy idiot.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell, I did.

                                     RYAN
                         My brothers would be mighty pissed
                         off at me, if they knew I let some
                         guy get killed trying to keep me
                         alive.

                                     SARGE
                         You didn't let anybody get killed,
                         you didn't even know we were coming
                         up here.

                                     RYAN
                         Sure, I know, but...
                              (sighs)
                         Goddamn it all...

               The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan.

               EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

               Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch.

                                     A SHADOW
                         It's Miller.  Easing through the
                         darkness.  Closer to one of the
                         sentries.

               Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller
               nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the
               sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS.

                                     BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.

                                     A GERMAN SENTRY
                         Approaches.  He sees Forrest.  Just
                         as he's about to open up with his
                         sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him
                         from behind, STABS him, eases the
                         body silently to the ground.

                                     MILLER AND JACKSON
                         Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.

               Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the
               German's truck.

                                     ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY
                         Rounds a corner.  Sees them.  OPENS
                         UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.

               Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.

                                     OTHER GERMANS
                         Race over, FIRING.

                                     JACKSON
                         Covering them, OPENS UP.  Kills the
                         advancing Germans.

               MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.

               FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.

               JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.

               Spins.

               Still FIRING.

               Giving Miller cover.

               MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.

               JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.

               JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.

                                     THE WINDSHIELD
                         Is shattered by bullets.

               Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.

                                     FORREST
                         In the back of the truck.

               Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.

               MILLER FLOORS IT.

               The truck DRIVES through the Germans.

               The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.
               MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.

               The Germans FIRING after them.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a
               gauntlet of Germans.  As they approach the bridge, the other
               American's FIRE COVER for them.

               Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.

               SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS

               THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the
               barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         RYAN!  GET BACK THERE!

               Ryan ignores him.  They get the eighty-eight safely behind
               the barricade.  Miller grabs Ryan.

                                     RYAN
                         Sorry, sir.

               Miller fumes.  he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,
               clearly not pissed at Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Don't do that again.

                                     RYAN
                         I won't need to sir, it's already
                         here, behind the barricade so...

               Miller GROWLS.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine.  Very
               gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.

               EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt.  They cover it and
               step back carefully.

               Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their
               tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll
               place the rest of the mines.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Quiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do
               now but wait.

               ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT

               Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see
               Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning
               the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.

                                     REIBEN
                         What do you think?

                                     JACKSON
                         I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.

                                     REIBEN
                         I mean, Ryan, what do you think of
                         him?

               Jackson shrugs.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't half-bad, I guess.

                                     REIBEN
                         I guess.

               They're quiet for a moment.

                                     JACKSON
                         He ain't Wade.

                                     REIBEN
                         Nope, he ain't Wade.

               Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         Crouch-runs through the shadows and
                         stops at the bridgekeepers hut.

                                     MILLER
                         Reiben...

               Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun
               nest.

                                     REIBEN
                         Yes, sir.

               REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.

               MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in
               the rear machine gun nest.

                                     MILLER
                         You set?  Sarge nods.

                                     RYAN
                         Yes, sir.

               Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to
               check the others.

               EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

               First light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE
               them in their positions:

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Manning the forward machine gun nest.

                                     JACKSON
                         Behind the sandbags, on top of the
                         bridgekeeper's hut.

               FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS

               Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward
               and the rear machine gun nests.

                                     RYAN AND SARGE
                         Manning rear machine gun.

                                     MILLER
                         At the bridgehead, waiting.

               SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD

               All eyes turn.

               SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER

               Dashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant.
               Then another.  And another.

                                     MILLER
                         Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down
                         behind some sandbags.

                                     MILLER
                         HERE THEY COME!

               A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

               THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE

                                     REIBEN
                         OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         At least fifty of them, advancing on
                         the bridge.  Running from cover to
                         cover.  A squad pushing a French
                         truck, using it as a shield.

                                     JACKSON
                         Calmly picking off the attacking
                         Germans.

                                     THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN
                         Make their way down the streets.
                         Along the riverbank.  Through the
                         houses.  There are GERMANS FIRING
                         from all directions.

               REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.

                                     MILLER
                         Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.
                         Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.

                                     REIBEN AND UPHAM
                         Running out of ammo.  See that there's
                         nothing else they can do.

                                     REIBEN
                         Time to go.

               Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.
               Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as
               they can.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER

               REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.
               Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.

               They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.

               DIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them.

                                     RYAN IS FIRING
                         With the rear MACHINE GUN.  Drops
                         several Germans.

                                     GERMANS EVERYWHERE
                         They swarm over the first barricade.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES A BURST into a German's belly.
                         HITS another with the stock of his
                         Thompson.

               HAND-TO-HAND.

               FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

               FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a
               flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of
               the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE
               PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late.

               THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER
               PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE

               No time to react.

                                     HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING
                         Half a dozen Germans break through.

               Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.

                                     RYAN
                         Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES.
                         KILLS the German.

                                     MILLER
                         Struggling with a pair of Germans.

                                     JACKSON
                         FIRES.  Drops one of the Germans on
                         Miller with a head shot.  Cuts open
                         Miller's face with bits of skull.

                                     RYAN
                         Leaps onto the final German attacking
                         Miller.  That German raises his rifle
                         on Ryan.

               UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON

               All see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.

                                     THE STUNNED GERMAN
                         About to kill Ryan.  Torn apart by
                         bullets from three directions.

                                     UPHAM
                         I got him.

                                     REIBEN
                         Like hell you did, I got him.

                                     JACKSON SMILES
                         He got him.

               MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four
               Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben
               and Upham:

                                     MILLER
                         BACK!  LET'S GO!

               They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make
               it to the barricade.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees them in deep trouble.  Leaves
                         Ryan firing the rear machine gun.
                         Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING
                         COVER.  Exposed.

                                     BULLETS EVERYWHERE
                         MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the
                         barricade.  Dive over.

                                     SARGE
                         Sees they've made it.  FIRES A FINAL
                         BURST.  Races for cover.  A trail of
                         bullets right behind him.

               THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth.  Trying to
               cover Sarge.  Too many Germans.

               SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.  MILLER AND THE OTHERS
               continue to fire, horrified.

               SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET

               Cradling the B.A.R.  Stumbling toward cover.  Slowing.
               Bleeding.

                                     THE AMERICANS
                         Desperately trying to cover him.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Open up with a volley.

                                     SARGE
                         Is almost there.

               ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE

               As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough.

                                     SARGE
                         Five feet from the sandbags, his
                         back is TORN APART by Germans fire.
                         He looks down, stunned at his chest.
                         Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An
                         instant of surprise, more than fear.

               He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls
               onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.
               THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Who killed Sarge are killed.  The
                         others back off for now.

               REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.

                                     MILLER
                         Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the
                         barricade.  Sees that he's dead.

               THE GERMANS RETREAT.

               Around the corner.

                                     MILLER
                         Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling
                         next to him.

                                     THE OTHERS
                         Watch, start to gather.

                                     REIBEN
                         Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
                         it...

                                     MILLER
                         Get back to your positions!

               They hesitate.

                                     MILLER
                         Go!

               They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move.
               He can't take his eyes off Sarge.

                                     MILLER
                         Doesn't move.  He just stares at
                         Sarge's body.

                                     RYAN
                         Looks at Miller, sees him growing
                         weak, starting to sway.  He gently
                         tries to move Miller aside.

                                     RYAN
                         I'll take care of Sarge...

               Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller
               grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made
               as he kneeled over Wade's body.

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?  Who's Sarge?

               But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The
               hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's
               called his own bluff.

               EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once.

               Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have
               tightened their perimeter.

               Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.

               They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.

               Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

                                     MILLER
                         English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.

               Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.

                                     UPHAM
                         What'd you say, Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         I teach English at Addley High School
                         in Addley, Pennsylvania.

                                     REIBEN
                         Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.

                                     JACKSON
                         Like hell, you did.

                                     UPHAM
                         Captain, what about our deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I changed my mind.

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     MILLER
                         I coach the baseball team, too.

                                     JACKSON
                         No kiddin'?

                                     REIBEN
                         What deal?

                                     UPHAM
                         Forget it.

               They all sit in silence.

                                     MILLER
                         You know that cruise ship Wade's
                         grandfather was on?

               They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's
               talking about.

                                     MILLER
                              (continuing)
                         I wonder if his cabin is still
                         available?

                                     REIBEN
                         That's not where I am.  Miller No?
                         Where are you?

                                     REIBEN
                         I'm in a dressing room with Mrs.
                         Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife.
                         She's an easy forty-four, double E,
                         but I've convinced her she's a thirty-
                         eight D and I'm watching her try and
                         squeeze herself into a side-stay,
                         silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle
                         with s Helf-lift brassiere.
                              (smiles)
                         She's having a devil of a time,
                         getting into that thing.

               They all share Reiben's dream for a moment.  Then Jackson
               smiles.

                                     JACKSON
                         Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy,
                         it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and
                         we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a
                         flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...

                                     REIBEN
                         Jackson, how many times I got to
                         tell you, you're from Tennessee.

                                     JACKSON
                         I am, but I like imported whiskey.
                         So there I am and I hear the biggest
                         ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a
                         rustlin' right there in front of me.
                         That ole' boy comes right out of the
                         brush, I got a clear shot and he
                         knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.
                         I aim, I got my finger tight on the
                         trigger and then I just smile and
                         say to that ole' coon, go on, now,
                         you get out 'a here.  Then I sit
                         down on a hollow log and take me a
                         right long pull a' that mash whiskey.

               Upham smiles.

                                     UPHAM
                         I don't know, I kind of like Wade's
                         idea about the cruise ship.  I've
                         never been to Tahiti.

                                     REIBEN
                         What about you, Captain?

               Miller smiles.  He knows exactly where he is.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm in my backyard, lying in my
                         hammock, with my arm around my wife,
                         listening for the sound of breaking
                         glass.

                                     JACKSON
                         Say what, Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         You see, I've got the best house in
                         all of Addley.  It's not the biggest
                         house, but it's got the best location,
                         right next to the junior high baseball
                         field.  The garage windows face left
                         field.  The guy who owned the house
                         before me had these heavy screen S
                         put over them.  The first thing I
                         did when I bought the place was take
                         off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-
                         two yards from home plate to my garage
                         windows.  It takes a hell of a junior
                         high kid to hit a ball that far.  I
                         look at my garage windows as a
                         Motivator and a way to scout the
                         kids coming up, the ones who are
                         going to give us a shot at the state
                         championship.  I lay there in my
                         hammock and every time I hear the
                         sound of breaking glass, I know we're
                         one step closer to winning it all.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't that get kind of expensive,
                         Cap'n?

                                     MILLER
                         It's worth it.

                                     JACKSON
                         To each, his own.

               They're all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.

                                     MILLER
                         How about you, James?

               Ryan sighs.

                                     RYAN
                         I'm home, playing basketball with my
                         brothers, it's evenin' time, we're
                         trying' to get in a few more points
                         before it's too dark to see the ball.
                         That's where I am.

               They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes
               it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all
               eat in silence.

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN

               First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.
               A SOUND.  Louder.  And louder.  A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES
               toward the village.

               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN

               All are awake.  At their positions.  Waiting.

                                     MILLER
                         Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF
                         THE TANK.  Barely has time to react.
                         Sees:

               THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN

                                     MILLER
                         Here they come.

                                     REIBEN
                         FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

               THE GERMANS KEEP COMING

               Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         Manning the forward machine gun.
                         Way out front.  Sees that he's going
                         to be cut off.  He grabs the hot
                         gun.  The barrel burns into his flesh.
                         He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK
                         toward the bridge.

               HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY
               BULLETS.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions near the bridge.
                         Moving in.  FIRING.  Overwhelming.
                         They're everywhere.

                                     THREE GERMANS
                         Break through the perimeter.

               RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.

                                     REIBEN
                         Sees Ryan.  Races over.  SHOOTS one
                         German.  STABS the other.

               RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt.

               REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE
               GUN.

               OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A
               LONG BURST.  Germans drop.

                                     MILLER
                         FIRES again.  More Germans drop.

                                     THE GERMANS
                         Take positions in the building near
                         the bridge.

               They start working their way to the tops of the nearby
               buildings.

               Making their way along the riverbanks.

                                     REIBEN AND RYAN
                         Forward.  Reiben FIRING.  Ryan feeding
                         the ammo belt.

                                     REIBEN
                         MORE AMMO!

                                     UPHAM
                         Hears that.  Doesn't hesitate.  He
                         grabs a pair of ammo boxes.  RUNS
                         toward Reiben and Ryan.

               SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

               OPEN UP on him.

               BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there.

                                     UPHAM
                         TAKES HALF-A-DOZEN SLUGS.  Torn apart.
                         Stumbles the final few steps to the
                         machine gun nest.  Falls on the
                         sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the
                         ammo.  UPHAM'S DEAD.

               RYAN STUNNED.

               For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN
               FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the
               one almost out.

                                     REIBEN
                         Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the
                         advancing Germans.

               THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK

                                     MILLER
                         Knows what that means.  He hears the
                         RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.

                                     MILLER
                         TIGHTEN IT UP!  HERE THEY COME!

                                     RYAN AND REIBEN
                         Immediately grab the machine gun and
                         ammo and race back to the rear nest.

               Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST
               TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two
               German infantry platoons.

                                     JACKSON
                         On the bridgekeeper's hut.  Picking
                         off German soldiers who follow the
                         tank.

               A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks
               voice-tube.

                                     THE TANK
                         Stops.  Grinds its gears.  Turning
                         it's turret towards the bridgekeepers
                         hut.

                                     MILLER
                         JACKSON!

                                     JACKSON
                         Knows what's coming but he holds his
                         position, continuing to pick off
                         German soldiers.

                                     THE TANK BLASTS
                         THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON
                         ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         SEE JACKSON DIE.  A bare moment to
                         react.  Then, they turn their
                         attention back to the eighty-eight.
                         Frantically turning the aiming cranks.
                         Lowering the barrel to point blank.

               TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               Which can fire first.

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Win the race.

                                     FIRE THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
                         BLAST THE LEAD TANK DESTROY IT IN A
                         SHOWER OF METAL AND FLAMES

                                     MILLER AND RYAN
                         Quickly reload the eighty-eight.
                         FIRE AGAIN.

               DESTROY THE SECOND TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Shoves the FINAL SHELL into the breech
                         of the eighty-eight.  Pats Ryan on
                         the back.  Grabs a SATCHEL CHARGE.

               RUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks.

                                     RYAN
                         FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.

               DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK.

                                     MILLER
                         Races through the debris.  Trailed
                         by BULLETS.

                                     REIBEN
                         With the machine gun.  Covers Miller.
                         Keeping most of the German infantry
                         down.

               RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun.  Opens up.  Helping
               to cover Miller.

               THE LAST GERMAN TANK

               Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.
               Ready to blow him to bits.

                                     MILLER
                         Is almost there.  He arms the satchel
                         charge.

               THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.

               BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS

                                     MILLER
                         Throws the satchel charge under the
                         tank.  Rolls off the edge of the
                         bridge.  Lands on the embankment
                         below.

               THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES

               MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

               Almost out of ammo.

               MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,
               hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

                                     MILLER
                         HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!

               Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

               A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard
               yet.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddamn it!

                                     REIBEN
                         More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them
                         The fear on their faces turns to
                         resignation.  They know that they
                         are dead men.  They settle into their
                         positions, and prepare to fire and
                         die.

               They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

               THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
               smile...then a real smile...

               AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then
               ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...

               MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN

               Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along
               with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

               They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after
               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a
               few among the departing Germans.

                                     THE ADVANCING TROOPS
                         Run onto the bridge and start to
                         secure the position.  A SERGEANT and
                         a few of HIS MEN look around,
                         curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
                         Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
                         among the bodies.

               A MAJOR strides up.

               Major Report, Captain.

                                     MILLER
                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,
                         that's Private Richard Reiben and
                         that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-
                         and-First Airborne.

               The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Ryan?

               One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

               Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

               The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

               Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

               Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.

               EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY

               American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
               road and over the bridge.

               MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN

               Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

                                     MILLER
                         Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down
                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a
                         long moment.  Then, with a steady
                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
                         dog-tags.  Then he does the same to
                         Jackson and Upham.

               REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

                                     MILLER
                         Stands and walks back to Reiben and
                         Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan
                         who grips them tightly and nods in
                         thanks.

               Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
               he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

               Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller
               down the road, away from the bridge.

                                     CAMERA CRANES UP
                         The three dirty, bloodied, tired men
                         walk down the road, ignored by the
                         fresh troops marching in the opposite
                         direction.

                                     RYAN
                         Captain?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, Private.

                                     RYAN
                         Upham and Jackson, what were they
                         like?

                                     MILLER
                         Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was
                         writing a book.

                                     RYAN
                         Yeah?

                                     REIBEN
                         Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the
                         220 in twenty-four-five.

                                     RYAN
                         No kidding.

                                     MILLER
                         Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,
                         he was going to be a preacher, his
                         father and uncles have a traveling
                         ministry out of the back of a stretch
                         Hudson.

                                     RYAN
                         And Sarge?

                                     MILLER
                         Sarge?
                              (beat)
                         He was the best friend I ever had.
                              (smiles)
                         Lemme tell you about Sarge...

               They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
               and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
               road and over the bridge.

               Fade out.

               THE END -

                              In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
                              effort to normalize relations with
                              the Carter Administration -- opened
                              the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
                              apparent intention of letting some
                              of his people join their relatives
                              in the United States. Within seventy-
                              two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
                              for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
                              became evident that Castro was forcing
                              the boat owners to carry back with
                              them not only their relatives but the
                              dregs of his jail population. 3y the

                              'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
                              An estimated 25,000 had criminal

                      Carter should see this human right.
                      He's good. He's very good.   What do                             ix:

           Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.    (X)
           He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
           eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
           He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

                       Seat's taken.

                       So I'll sit in your lap.
           Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
           of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
           returns the empty wrapper to Manny,

                                                       We're watching
      . . . the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid.
      a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra -
      Madre.     It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking
      to himself just before the bandits get him....

      The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
      the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
      eyes in cat-like repose...to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an
      eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

                                          BOGART
                                                   What a thing.
                        Conscience.    Conscience.
                        Xf you believe you've got a conscience,
                       'it`ll pester you to death.   But if you

                     over his shoulder. Hunh?   Like me....
         He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
         imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
         zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
         Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
         pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
         And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
         more pronounced.

        for Manny.  "Later."

        He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
        market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transves-
        tites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack
        neon.

            Tony,     five     minutes        later,        in   a   phone    booth, in    the    middle     of
  ._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
            trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.

            Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
            number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
            finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
            a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
            standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
            shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
            handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
            rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
            not yet seen in Tony.
            Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
            expression         alters         to     uncertainty.
                                                            VOICE
                             Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this?
            Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
            in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
            ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
            pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
            He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
            somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.

            Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
            the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
            worn phone book in his hand.

       Tony waves    her off, then changes his mind and runs up
       behind her    and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
       Before she    can react, he hops away laughing as the two
       Cuban girls    ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

                 Bey that's not cool, man. You wanna

       He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
       whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
       the flick of an eye.

       Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
       provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a
       shop window.

       Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking .out his arm
       and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
       give a shit.
                                                  TONY
                       Come     on?
       Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
       car screeching to a halt in front of him.

                                                  TONY

                       Okay Rober Retfor,               strut your stuff.
       The    blonde    has     paused    to     look    in   a    shop    window.

       Manny stops alongside, pretends to                          look.    When he catches
       her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

       She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
       Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

       Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
       child, four, toddling along with it's'mom.  Be makes his
       own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
       him puzzled. Tony produces another face.   The kid now
       smiles.  The mother looks over.  Tony shrugs.  She smiles
       and moves along.

       Meanwhile,       Manny    has     moved     close      to    the    blonde    and   suggests
       something,    his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It
       takes a    moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
       and walks        away.
       Tony     walks    over     to     him,    mocking.

           we are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners.  Young
           Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
           diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
           They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with
           friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.
           Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
           M--q, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.

                       Look at that chick man, wow!   Look
                       at them knockers.

     Omar Suarez (El Mono -- "The Monkey") is so named 'cause he
     looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
     intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
     between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon
     from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the
     wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with
     him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana.
     In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline,
     flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

     Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly
     as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move
     back to Manny.

34   EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY                                    34
     The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-
     inch Columbian, "The Toad". He's in his forties, sports
     shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on
     his face, like Omar; he's good-natured, a nice guy, he
     smiles.

                               TOAD

     Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.

     Tony, stepping   into the conventionally tasteless orange and
     blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the
     windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture inducating
     he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not
     meant to be a body search.

                         he steps in)

     The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
     Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails,
     and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the
     Toad, about five-two.
     The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

      the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

     commotion.

       She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the
       eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to
       Shoot.


       The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back,
       approaches Tony.
       Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
       Columbians, "The Kids". They slam the door, both carrying
       Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl
       or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair
       cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little
       pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard
       in fast Columbese slang.
       As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

                   Frog face, you just fucked up.     You

                   Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the

                   Try sticking your head up your ass.
                   See if it fits.
       Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
       taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
       in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
       into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
       Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
       pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6
       assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun,
       completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on
       the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami,
       is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

     Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the
     shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the
     bathtub.   Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

     Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
     bathroom.   He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
     pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
     Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady.     They're
     dead     and they know it.

     Toad,   well-prepared, connects                     a     voltage    adapter and
     extension cord.

                                                TOAD
                                 (to Tony)
                       You watch what happens to your friend
                       okay?  If you don't want this to
                       happen to you, you get the money.

     Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who
     nods and turns             on the whirring machine.
     The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly
     towards Angel.
     The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at                                            his
     brains...o.c. we know what's happening as we hear the
     chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.
                        no expression
     Lizard     has                           on     her       face.     The        machine     cuts    off.

     The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his
     shirt, examjning  his first cut like a butcher. He glances
     at Tony.

     A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a
     strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a
     terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

     Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with
     Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel.   They
     signal and separate.

     The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched
     with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.
     Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily
     dotting his eyes.
                                 TOAD
                 Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die
                 too. Makes no difference to me.
     He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
     lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
     his blood, piss dead.

     Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram
     pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to
     notice.
     At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens....

     The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the
     shower.
     The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

     Tony,     devastated,            spits      in     his     face.

                                                TONY
                     Go       fuck      yourself.
     Toad's      eyes     narrow        meanly.

     Kid   one    slaps         the    tape       across       Tony's        mouth.

     Kid two      reaches        up     to       tighten       the     overhead          strap       to    Tony's
     wrist.

     The Toad turns on his                       chainsaw          when    suddenly           there's       a
     gunshot from the hall.

45   INT./EXT.       TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
     shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
     crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything
     happens very fast now.
     Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid
     one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

     Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
     unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
     across   the bathroom.
     The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

     Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards.
     Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

     The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
     him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
     Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
      In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees,
      foaming blood.

      Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
      kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
      stock of his own Ingram.

      In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
                  strength, he tears out the motel room door
      hysterical
      gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.
                                                                                     c0NT1NuED

     Chi-Chi     climbing         through     the        window     fires    at        him.

     Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
     a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
     second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
     pistol.

     He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten
     craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

     Tony,     yelling, whirls              after     the    Toad.

                                                    TONY
                       I   got him!

     Manny, holding his side, empties                         his    pistol       on     kid      one     who
     is still twitching.
     Chi-Chi     sees       Angel,         gags.
                                                                            CUT        TO

     The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter
     in astonishment.
     As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying,
     chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

     Their      eyes       follow.

     As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set
     in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
     There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
     that counts.  He stands behind the Toad.

                                                    TONY

     The     Toad   whips         around     to    the     voice, eyes          stark       with        terror.
     Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart.
     The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity.            Then
     an old lady faints.
     The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
     turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
     audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
     and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-
     fication.

     A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security
     and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury
     items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes
     quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

     The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor,
     dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat
     preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony
     effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now
     Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the
     heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and
     bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

          .We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
          out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis,
          Lamberghinis and Corniches   in a long snaking line down the
          driveway.    Single girls in high-collared silver lame
          jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening
          tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young
          coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in

          The interior is built like three or four plush apartments
          that run together on three separate levels with imaginative
          angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band,
          hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games,
          computers and a restaurant. Itrs a lavish fun spot that
          will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven
          and nighttime capital of South America.

          The crowd, a combination of                  Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
          young, rich and happy and a                  lot of them coked; the girls,
          upperclass in sleek dresses,                   trim figures, heels, hats,
          sensuous bodies, yell as they                  dance to a black American

     The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
     hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
     and high heels.

     Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
     necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

     Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
     tough-looking tank tops with "Motherfuckah" and "Fuck Me"
     written on them.  Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to

          It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the                                floor, leading
          Elvira.   It's not so much an act of walking                             as it is an act
          of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody                               off that gets
          in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight                               dead line, eyes
          forward.   It's not that he doesn't see the                              people he bumps
          off, it's that he couldn't care less.

68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 68      The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
     'with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
      Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without
     rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the
     impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

     Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a
     cautious cat is his ninteen-year-old sister Gina.  Their
     eyes lock.

 TONY                              (moved)
                  Hi        Gina....

 GINA                   Tony?
     She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
     curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
     large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
     (She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
     Tony's    possession.)

 TONY                           (covering his

     Tony, over      her    shoulder,     opens   the      gift.

 TONY                    Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think
                   they can keep a guy like me down?
     Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift
     box in font of her.   It's a beautiful diamond locket to
     wear around her neck.   Her eyes open wide.

 TONY                    ...yeah for      you...and look --               here.

     The    mother is amazed       at the cost        of      the    gift.       Tony pulls
     out    another present,       for her.

 TONY                    ...for    you    too   Mama, look....
     Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
     exquisite peral   necklace.  She stares at it, doesn't take
     it.   Gina comes over, takes it for her.

 GINA                              it's beautiful...

 ELVIRA                      (same tone of
                     voice as before)
              Don't get confused, Tony.             I     don't
              fuck around with the help,
As he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish
grin on his face.

 CUT TO INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93 Subtitle     appears:

 COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with "Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face.   He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

     Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
     lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive  iron
     kettles bubbling with coca paste...across  to a row of ovens
     where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
     working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey" as he
     passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
     vineyard.

 SOSA                            so this and my other factory 1 can
                       &&A guarantee production of 200
                       kilos refined every month   of the
                       year.   Problem is I have no steady
                       market.    Some months I can't get rid
                       of fifty keys, other months I have to
                       do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh?
                       Nobody can run a business that way ---

 OMAR                        I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got
                       the same problems up in Miami, the
                       demand varies for us too, month to
                       month....
     Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his
     skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
     nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

     Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to
     look at a sample of the dried coke.
     The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him.

     Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
     samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause.                       His
     expression says I like it.   He moves on.
     The Shadow moves with him.
 SOSA                                 (meanwhile)
                       ...Basically what I'm looking for is
                       somebody to share the risks with me,
                       somebody in the States who might
                       guarantee me something like-.-say
                       150 kilos a month.
 OMAR                        That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa.   It's
                       too bad Frank's not here.   Something
                       like that you should talk to him. .

     Looking over the laboratory like it was his.                Omar glances
     at him, annoyed.

               go....
 CUT TO 94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94      The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
     to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
     from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
     At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony.     The Shadow sits impas-
     sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar
     and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the
     glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
     He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements
     of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-
     stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

 SOSA                        (to Omar)
               ...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys
               a month for a year, and he picks it
               up down here, I could sell it to him
               for as little as 7000 a kilo.  You

 SOSA                    When we cut out.the Coluxnbians we

 TONY                      Split the risk. Guarantee your
                     delivery as far as Panama.
 SOSA                      Panama?  Risky?   It costs me more.
                     There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.

                     Forget it.
         Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe
         assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his
         brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.
 SOSA                      What do you suggest is a fair...?
                     Excuse me.
          Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
          appears at the door, apparently with a message.  Sosa waves
          him in.
          The black aide Y- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
          with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
          on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical
          qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he
          approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling

     just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the
     same stony, loyal expression.
     Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
     A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
     Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
     Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

 TONY                Panama.   You're looking for a partner,
               right?
     Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.
 SOSA                ...something like that.
                       (chuckles)
 OMAR                Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of
               ourselves here.   I'm down on Frank's
               authority to buy 200 keys, that's it,
               that's my limit.    I got no right to
               negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything
               larger than that. So why don't we...
 TONY                Hey Omar why don't you let the man
               finish, hunh? Let him propose his
               proposition.

 TONY                  I gotta hand it to you. You got
                 everything a man could want.
     Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars
     on the patio table, looks up through them, at the heli-
     copter rising off the lawn.

 SOSA                          (focusing the
                         binoculars)
                 I like you Tony. There's no lying
                 in you.. .Unfortunately I don't feel
                 the same way about the rest of your
                 organization.

     Tony glances    up       at     the    chopper, the servant pouring coffee
     for him.

      bulls in.

 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105 105 
      The place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in
      tuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the
      many people who know them now. We might note Tony has
      refined the art of walking and no longer bulls Deonle out
 L L       of his path, he angles th?ough them. -

                Over here.
      Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
      dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.
 TONY                 What the fuck is she doing here,
                she's....
                        (heading
                        towards her)

                Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's just
                a disco for chrissake. What do you
                give her money for if you don't want
                her to go out, have some fun?
      Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves
      back.  Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.
 TONY                 Who's she with?

                     kid, he works for Luco, he's

      Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him.     Caucasian,
      about 250 pounds.
 TONY                 Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
                don't dance too close.

                Sure Tony.

       There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's 'cause just

 TONY                         Talk about what, what's there to

 TONY                                   That's     what     I'm      doing,     Frank.

                 Manny      suddenly       slides      into     frame,      backing     Tony.

 TONY                                            (icy)

 ELVIRA                 Frank, this is ridiculous....
 LOPEZ                 C'mon!
      He crowds her.              she goes.   Tony watches as they exit
                         Angry,
      the club.

                What     happened?
 TONY                 That cocksucker! -- He put that
                homicide prick Bernstein on me.
      They stroll back to the table.

                What for?
 TONY                 The Emilio Rebenga hit.        Remember
                that.

                You're    kidding!
 TONY                 Who else knew about it? Omar's
                fertilizer, ain't he? Lopez is
                letting me know he's got weight on
                me.

                I don't know, things don't look so
                good here, Tony. Maybe we should
                get outta town for a while, y'know,
                go up to New York?
 TONY                 You go.   I like the weather here
                just fine.
      He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she
      follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the
      stairs to the toilets.
      Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts
      after her.

 CUT TO 108 INT. BABYLON CLUB - STAIRS AND LADIES ROOM - NIGHT 10E       Tony comes down the plush velvet stairs, flings himself
      into the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at
      him. No Gina.

 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MEN'S ROOM AND STAIRS - NIGHT 109 105 
      He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
      There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.  Tony
      moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
      the door.
      It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
      burgundy suit running his ha&s along her ass.
 GINA                                (shocked)

                     doing!
      He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
      times into the wall.

 GINA                                (trying to

      He   rips   the     coke out      of    her      hands   and   scatters   it   across
      the tiles.

      The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
      the hallway. Several more people are watching.
 GINA                 You got a nerve, Tony, you got a

      into the toilet.
                             Tony stands there, abated.

      Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina

      He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
      no regrets, but disturbed.
      Manny helps Gina to her feet.

      coupe.  She's still angry.
 GINA                    ...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
                Mama's right. She says he hurts every-

      Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
      sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
      light drawing immediate laughter.
      He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
      mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
      With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
      sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
      the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever"
      and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts
      shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
      staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
      Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
      More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
      PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
      face of a young clown in white paint with the large
      blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
      audience.
      Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
      The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
      pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
      bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
      everybody is merry...

            sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
            its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
            Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.     His
            antennae warn him.     Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
            The two hitters moving on him.
            He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
            smashing the mirrors....
            Screams,    crowd diving for cover....
            Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of
            his ankle, firing....
            Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers
            across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
            ceilings....
            Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing....
            The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
            mirrors, and more screaming.
            Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
            door, his clothes ripped with blood and'glass.
            The clown, Octavia,    lies dead on the silent dance floor.
 CUT TO 114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114             Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.
            Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking
            lot, he runs out of ammunition.
            He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
             The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club,
             towards him.
             The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
             Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
             machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
             Carhops    scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
             Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head
             exploding like squashed watermelon.

114 CONTINUED 114       Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
      across the shattered windows.
      He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
      the armor plating, whining against the shutters.
      Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
      gear shift into reverse.
      In an instant, his warmobile                        in reverse,
                                           accelerates
      climbing to top speed....
      As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
      there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

 CUT TO INT. SAFE 115 HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115       Tow, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
      reveals to Us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
      it, doesn't express a reaction.

 DOCTOR                   It's going to be sore for a few
                  months.

      Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror,
      takes the phone, in good spirits.

          and Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...
          Lopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office
          door.
 LOPEZ'S VOICE                        .you're kidding! Three to two?

          Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
          with guns casually drawn.

 123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123 TONY                       Yeah, it sure is Frank.     What'd    you
                      do -- fix the umpire?
          Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
          there and then, but manages to recover.

 LOPEZ                       Tony...?   Uh, I'll call you
                      back-.-yeah.
          Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
          Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
          sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
          other side of the room.

 LOPEZ                       Tony... what happened to you, hunh?

              Tony,
              shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein
              sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred
              and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.

            Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
            forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

 TONY                                ...Every     dog    has his day.

               He    fixes     his   eyes    on    Mel   Bernstein.
 BERNSTEIN                                          (remaining   calmly
                                         in his chair)
                               I told him it didn't make sense                 --
                               cliptiing   you when he coulda had              you
                               working for us instead. But he                  got
                               hot tonight, y'know, about the                  broad.
                               He fucked up.
 TONY                                Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.
               His      eyes.. .Bernstein,         reading     them,   gets    worried.

 BERNSTEIN                                 Now wait a minute, Montana, don't go
                                too far.
 TONY                                 I'm not Mel. You are.
               He produces his Baretta from his sling and holds it in his
               left hand pointed at the big man.

 BERNSTEIN                                        (rising from
                                       his chair)
                                                                         You can't
                                Hey, c'mon, what is this?
                                shoot a cop, Tony.
 . . TONY                                 Whoever     said     you were     one?
                He    fires.

                Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up
                astonished.
 BERNSTEIN                                 .I. lemme         go, Tony, I can fix         things
                                up....
 TONY                                 Sure you can Chico.   Maybe you can

                                have a good trip.
                He    fires several times into him until we can imagine he                         is
                      longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.

 ERNIE                           Thanks,            Tony.
      Tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the
      hulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny
      and Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.

      Elvira lies            in     her           silk     sheets.     The   doorbell       rings.   She
      gets up.

       In     a    nightgown, she                 opens      the     front   door.

 ELVIRA                           Tony?...

       Tow, still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling,
       moves       past     her     into           the      apartment.

 ELVIRA                           What's             happened?
       Tony       just     stands            there.

 ELVIRA                           Where's            Frank?

 TONY                           Where do you think?..Why don't you
                          go pack your stuff. We're going

       which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
       sign on the front lawn that says:
 THE WORLD IS YOURS

             Tony,  accompanied by Marmy, walks a young, thirtyish bank
             president into his office, which is rigged with video
             monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.
             There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound
             systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs --
             but not one sign of a book on the walls.
             Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the
             eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who
             follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who
             never stops thinking money.

 TONY                          ...yeah, well, I can't pay that no
                         more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in

                         That's serious money.   So I think
                         it's time you bank boys come down

                         The more cash you give us the harder it
                         is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we

 TONY                     Then fuck you, I'll fly the cash to the

 BANKER                     You gonna fly it yourself, Tony -- on a
                    regular basis? Once maybe.    And then

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY       Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
      glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
      taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
      As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
      suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
 "CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC. 
160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 16       The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
      There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
      moving, talking.
      Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
      from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
      Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
      chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
      passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
      which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
      Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
      rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.
      The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
      smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
      coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
      look the part.
      It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties,
      it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory
      dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop
      the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the
                 At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of
      amounts.
      the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly
      although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of
      coffee.
 LUIS                    . I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
                                         I was in that picture

                  to a hotel.
      Tony shakes his   head, grimacing like he's having an
      epileptic fit.
 SHEFFIELD                   I'll delay the trial.  A year and a
                  half, two years, you won't start

                  you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?

 SHEFFIELD                   Tony.. .the law has to prove 'beyond
                  a reasonable doubt.'   I'm an expert
                  at raising that doubt but when you
                  got a million three undeclared
                  dollars staring into a videotape

                  convince a jury you found it in a
                  taxi cab.

      Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
      Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
      Sheffield's desk.
 TONY                   All right-.-all     right. I do the
                  three fuckin' years but lemme tell
                  you about my law, George.     It's real
                  simple.   There's no 'reasonable
                  doubt.'   If you're rain-making the
                  judge or you fuck me for the four
                  hundred grand and I come in guilty

 SHEFFIELD                           (cool)
                  The point is made. Now where's the
                  money?
      Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
      desk.  Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
      hands as he steps out of the office.  He  sniffs.   .

 INTERVIEWER                   I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez,
                  about the financial support your govern-
                  ment receives from the drug industry in
                  Bolivia.

 GUTIERFSZ                   The irony, of course, is that this
                  money -- which is in the billions,
                  J i m - - is coming from your country.
                  You are the major purchaser of our
                  national product -- which of course
                  is cocaine.

 INTERVIEWER                   So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez
                  is the United States Government is
                  spending millions of dollars to
                  eliminate the flow of drugs into our
                  streets and at the same time is

                  government that floods those' streets

                        I'm not going home with you...I'm
                        not going home with anybody. I'm

                        I'm leaving you.   I don't need this
                        shit anymore.
            Pause.    She starts wobbling out. Past the silent
            spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony.

            Manny   rises     to     follow.

 TONY                         Let her go! ..Another guaalude                     and
                        she'll lpve me again.

173 CONTINUED - 5 173       The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
      food, the silence cathedral.   He stands, wiping at the food
      and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
      then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

 TONY                       You're all assholes. You know why?
                      'Cause none of you got the guts to be
                      what you want to be.
      He wobbles        against   the   table.    Manny   tries     to    help.    Tony
      shakes him        loose.

 TONY                       You need people like me so you can
                      point your fingers and say 'hey
                      there's the bad guy!'   So what does
                      that make you? Good guys? Don't
                      kid yourselves. You're no better'n
                      me. You just know how to hide --
                      and how to lie. Me I don't have
                      that problem.   I always tell the
                      truth -- even when I lie.
      He     starts     out,   staggers.

 TONY                       So say good night to the bad guy...
                      You're never gonna see a bad guy
                      like me again.

      He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
      is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
      its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
      and delight.

      A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
      stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
      moves into frame.
      Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
      parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
      under the car.

      Tony     looks:

, 176 CHI-CHI 176 --d--         waits    in   Tony's   sedan   double-parked   down   the   block.

              Tony,    feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
              snort,    paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
              under.
              Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
              the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
              camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
              taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
              the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass
              button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as
              the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
              axle of the car.

 TONY 178 170 
                sees     it.

                A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
                towards us,
                Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape
                trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
                Tony     hurries     to     the    car,    bends   down.

                The      Shadow     douses    it     and    freezes     in     position.

                Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
                passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to
 .                 her partner who eases the car to a halt.

                Tony      hurries     out     into    the     street,        taking     the     initiative.

                 Tony looks at them go, takes another snort,                                  walks   over    to
                 the car, bangs on the hood several times.

      gun drawn, glowing with perspiration.                          When        he realizes it's
      a joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.

            Chi-Chi waiting in a busy lounge covering Tony on the phone;
            Tony's still wearing the same clothes with patches of blood
            on them.
 TONY                            Ernie?       Where the fuck you been?

 ERNIE'S VOICE.                            I don't know, Tony. He's been gone
                           last couple of days. Didn't say
                           nothing.

 ERNIE'S VOICE                     Yeah, okay            Tony.
      Tony hangs up. A              moment of despair.             Then   he        snorts
      another spoon and             snaps back.

      Tony     stalks     off, towards           his      office.


 214 214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE 
      Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
      and  stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.

 TONY                     Yeah?          Hi.     Mami.

                                    Her voice on the phone sounds
      The other phone is ringing.
      hysterical and angry. Not really listening, Tony breaks
      open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across
      the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.
      Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.
 TONY                                 (into the phone)
                        Yeah, all right.   I hear you. No

                        problem, okay.

                              snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi                  indicates.
      He hangs up,
      The telephone           should be the latest in gimmickry.

        screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill

              A     monsoon-like         wind     blows     through       the      trees     on     the    estate.

              The     monkeys      listen        quietly.
              The     f    lamingoes       flutter.
              . . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo
              speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something
              smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they
              go...

                                 see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace
              . . . and we
              doors and          stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his
              estate.
              ...On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
              balustrade.   He's done so much coke now he's practically
               catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

 TONY                                             (insensate)
                                 . . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter

                                 let 'em try I bury the cocksuckers....

              His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness
                                  The wind rustling the treetops. Tony
              echoes back at him.
              shaking his head at himself, He starts to cry!

                    What the hell happened to us?...
      In far b-g. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors
      in his office we see:
      The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into                       (X
      view, checks the gate, turns.  Suddenly two figures spring
      out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He
      struggles.
      Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
      the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other
      Marielito
      A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving
      through the trees on the estate.
      On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
      incoherent.
 TONY                     ...I said to you, Manny, I said I
                    never go crazy and you said, I would

                    those were the good days hunh, we

                    --   the   fucking      best....
      As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors
      into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a
      hook flying up and catching the balustrade.                     A shadow
      starts climbing up as:
 TONY                     ...we still are Manny, we still are

 226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226                As he crosses into his office, the                           camera moves to      reveal
               Gina standing there half-dressed in                          the     doorway,   her eyes
               blazing with hatred.
               Tony     sees   her.

               She steps         forward, offering her body almost naked to her
               brother.

 GINA                                Is     this    what       you want      Tony?...
               Tony     shocked.

 GINA                                You can't stand another man                         touching
                               me.  So you want me Tony, is                        that it?
                               Well here I am 0-T
               She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand.

               The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his
               catatonia   as he goes reeling across the floor behind his
               desk.    She fires again.  Again.

 GINA                                I'm all        yours       Tony,       I'm all yours
                               now.
               Bullets ripping into the desk.   She advances, offering
               her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic
               intervals.

 GINA                                Come and get me Tony.                   Before       it's
                               too     late.

               He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
               distance between them.  She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
               expression like a demented angel.
 . GINA                                  Come on Tony, fuck           me!       Fuck       me!
                                 Fuck me!

               Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
               spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
               squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
               over to the terrace windows.   Her next shot shatters the
               window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside
               onto the terrace behind him:

      A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
      hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
      He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

      Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
      room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

      Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
      swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
      The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
      Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
      him over the balustrade.

      The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
      at the base of the balcony.
      Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
      empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
      pool below.

      Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots                  (X
               yells    up     ---
      Tony,

                   Tony,         they're    everywhere!
                   here!
      Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    (X
      silencer bullets.
      We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
      moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
      underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

      Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
      into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
      It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
      looking questioningly in her face.

 TONY                                    (gently)
                       Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at
                       me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I
                       was..    .I   was.


      Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her,
      gently lifting her eyelids.  Blood's running out of her
      mouth in rivers.

      There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (X:
      of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over
      at the monitors.
      One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
      pounding it.
 CHI-CHI                 Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up!
      On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
      down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
      goes off, blows him up against the door.
 TONY                 Cheeee!
      He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
      sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket
      launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks
      up at the monitor.
      On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
      foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
      Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
      the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a
      grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.
      Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch,
      talking to himself.
 TONY                  So you wanna play hunh, say hello                    (XI
                 to my little friend here.

      The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian
                                             It sounds like
      punks off the landing into the foyer.
      Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing
      wildly.
      Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
      of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

Laughing like a madman. TONY You need an army you hear! An army to kill me! Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white.
